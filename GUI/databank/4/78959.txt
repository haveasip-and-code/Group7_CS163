Spartanburg  SC
A two-part paradox. ; 1) One half of the population of this town exemplify the glorious southern heritage of which one should be proud to have. These are generally the individuals who make it out of Spartanburg for high school and college education. (However, there are exceptions, but not likely). These people know how to shag, hold a door for a lady, what fork to use, and how many pieces of ice should accompany a fine glass of scotch. ; On the other side... ; 2) One half of the population is the epitome of backward America - where individuals in college still try to fight others in groups, or because someone did something to them 8 years ago in Junior High. Pathetic people at their worst. These are those who have been consumed by the Spartanburg syndrome to live off your parents and not leave Spartanburg for any form of intellectual curiosity - i.e. education. These folks make me sick to be from this happy, inviting little town which is home of the The Beacon.
