Sex Swamp
when you masturbate or have sex sitting down, the increased bloodflow to the pelvic region causes the your ass and the nether region to sweat, makeing your underwear (if your wearing any) very uncomfortable and wet. ; note: ; nether region = area between a man's scrotum and ass hole. especially in the little nook right behind his balls. ; the 'swamp' part of the word refers to 'swamp ass' (similar thing but from running around)
