Acronym for , Nitrous Oxide Sytems, used for fuel injected cars ( can be used for carbuerated, with a lot more hassle and cussing) to boost the car's acceleration by injecting a pre-determined shot of nitrous oxide into the fuel-air mixture. Doing this creates a feeling similar to turbo-charging your car. This can sometimes be a cheaper alternative to turbo or super chargers. However, nitrous requires refilling whereas turbo does not, so turbo pays off in the long run. Both can create an undesirable high pitched sound commonly heard in briggs and stratton's, I mean 4-bangers. So for a way to increase performance w/out 2-stroke sounds, please see [NA]
