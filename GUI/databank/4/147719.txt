spunch
An epically powerful punch drunkenly threatened against something or someone deemed incredibly annoying...rarely ever landed, much less thrown. Came from a drunk friend of mine who told me that he wanted to punch someone on TV, but slurred before he could get the word out so it came out 'spunch'. It snowballed from there.
