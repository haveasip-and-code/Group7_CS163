skoda
Czech automaker, now part of Volkswagen Auto Group. Has been building cars for over a hundred years. Despite poor build quality during latter half of the 20th century, has been transformed by VW AG into the producer of some of the most reliable cars in the world, with an excellent dealer network to match. Currently offers the Fabia, Octavia, and Superb, with many choices of body styles and engines. Despite being criticized for staid design, which has closely resembled VW and SEAT cars, Skoda has a very progressive development team that is not afraid to try radical things. Offers very economical transport to those with a limited budget, and magnificent automobiles to those who have the money to shop elsewhere if they so desired. Unbeatable combination of price and quality will contribute to its growth and success over the next hundred years.
