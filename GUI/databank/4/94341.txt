New Age Outlaws
A WWF tag team formed in the late 90's. Consisting of 'Badd Ass' Billy Gunn and Road Dogg (formally The Roadie), originally were an upstart team that had little success. Eventually joined with D-Generation X (a popular faction in the WWF) and became very popular. Road Dogg usually would speak over their entrance music.
