Dawn of the dead
Is a really great zombie movie from 1979. It was released as the sequel to Night of the Living Dead. It's got the best gore in it and the best zombies. DO NOT SEE THE REMAKE!!! It was terrible and should be destroyed immediately. If you want to see Dawn of the Dead, make sure its the old one, not the bullshit one.
