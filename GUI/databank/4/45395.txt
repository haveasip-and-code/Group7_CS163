Japanese Girls
Obviously females originating from Japan. Looking at the other definitions, though, there seem to be an ulterior meaning. ; There are a number of American men who prefer Asian ladies (especially Japanese) because they believe American women (or possibly western women in general) are undesirable due to a lack of lady-like qualities. ; Many (notably feminists) have the misconception that Japanese females are naturally submissive, which seems to be proven incorrect by the definition above me. Aside from that, though, it is true that most women in Japan are not submissive, but it is also true that they do not tend to view relationships as a struggle for power like many American women.
