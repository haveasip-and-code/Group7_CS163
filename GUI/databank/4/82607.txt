fun house
The best Tv show there ever was. You had Pat Sharp, Pat Sharp's mullet, two sexy as hell twins who were hella gagging for it, go-karts and the funnest house you can imagine. You'd go in the fun house, have a whole bunch of fun and then win prizes. I think you had to collect something but I can't remember. ; Either way if I was a contestant and the buzzer went off to sigify the end I'd be all like, 'as if I'm leaving, I'm moving into this fun house!' and the producers would be like 'shit, please leave,' and I'd be like, 'no.'
