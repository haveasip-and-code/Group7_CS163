Project Old School
A slang term that defines the act of drinking alcoholic beverages before heading to a bar or night club. The reasoning for this is so that once you arrive at your party place, you would already be feeling the effects of what you had previously drank, therefore limiting your need to purchase additional (overpriced) drinks at the bar. This saves you money and time if your goal is to get drunk. ; Origin: Canada
