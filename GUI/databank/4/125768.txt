ApeStorm
To become so intensely angry, so massively incensed that you begin to resemble a Ape during a thunderstorm i.e throwing your shit about, shaking kids in pushchairs, tearing zookeepers in half. ; Imagine yourself as King Kong on amphetamines, just as you find out godzillas taken a dump on your car.
