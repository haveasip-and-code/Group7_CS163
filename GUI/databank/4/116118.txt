Saskatchewan
Easiest province to draw, beautiful skies, hundreds of lakes and hills (contrary to popular belief), and a fabulous music scene. Unfortunately, it is a place where many good people leave, making former Saskatchwan residences known throughout Canada (especially Vancouver) as incredibly talented and hard working people. But consequently, they are leaving the province to fester with age and incompetence. It is an incredibly beautiful and peaceful place to be from, though most people simply pass through on the highway, which is a lame-ass way to see somewhere. If you are awsome, please stop leaving Saskatchewan because a province can't be run by aging farmers. Look at Alberta.
