Corrs
The Corrs are an irish band originating from Dundalk, Ireland. Consisting of: ; Andrea Corr(05-17-74): Lead vocals, tin whistle, piano ; Caroline Corr(03-17-73: Drums, Bodhran, Piano, Backing Vocals ; Sharon Corr(03-24-70): Violin, Piano, Backing Vocals ; Jim Corr(07-31-64): Guitar, piano, Backing Vocals. ; The Corrs got their start when auditioning for 'The Commitments'. Although, they only got Minor parts, (Andrea became Jimmy Rabbitte's little sister Sharon, Jim is part of the Avant Garde-A-Clue Band, Sharon is in the Country and Western band Bernie joins in the end, playing fiddle, and Caroline can be seen in the audience before 'I Never Loved a Man') they also left with a manager, John Hughes. Their next break happened by luck, while performing a gig at a local pub, Jean Kennedy Smith was in the back and enjoyed their sounds so much she invited them to come sing in America. While there they dropped in unexpectedly on David Foster, and played for him. This got them their record deal. ; Their first album, Forgiven not Forgotten was a huge sucess, with hits like Runaway and The Right Time. Followed by Talk on Corners, In Blue, a Best of Album, Borrowed Heaven, and their much anticipated Home, filled with traditional irish tunes, most pulled from the music book of their late mother, Jean (who died in 1999 of a very rare lung diesease). The album is expected out in late September for most countries. Other CDs include Live in Dublin, with appearances by Ronnie Wood, and Bono, and Unplugged.
