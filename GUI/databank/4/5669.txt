wendigo
An unusual creature from Yukon myths, half phantom, half beast, embodying the dangers of Winter in the flesh. An elemental spirit of the wind and cold, it moves through the woods with preternatural stealth and speed, leaving hauntingly scorched trails of distantly spaced footprints in the snow. ; It's attributed various powers, including flight, invisibility, the projection of illusions, and a keen tracking sense for its prey - typically unwary travellers, especially young and foolhardy ones. ; The most common origin for a Wendigo is the consumption of human flesh during a harsh winter; this awakens a feral hunger that gradually transforms one into the monster. Intentional association with fell powers ('bad medicine') can also achieve the same result. ; The Wendigo has been made most famous by its use by Algernon Blackwood in his short story The Wendigo. It's since inspired a Marvel comics character by the same name and various movies and television shows. ; Also a well-known knave from Gaia Online.
