sasquatch
The 'official' name of Bigfoot; a creature popularly described as being human-like in form but massive in size, appetite, and shoe-size (hence the name...). Often depicted as ape-like and bipedal, this hair-covered mammal is believed by arguably delusional hippies to be the last surviving link between modern man and our evolutionary past. It is believed that the creature resides in the dense forests of the American/Canadian northwest, due to the unconfirmed sitings of this creature in years past. The reason theorists believe it has survived so long is due partly to its elusive, defensively aggressive isolationist behavior, but also its ability to hibernate for very long periods of time after feeding seasons.
