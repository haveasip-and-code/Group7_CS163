hasu
All these other definitions of this korean word are wrong.. ; Hasu is the opposite of gosu. which means high hand. So hasu means low hand. chobo is just a bad manner way to say hasu, and hasu is the good manner way to say it especially when referrin to yourself as a newbie. P.S. these are slang for online video games.
