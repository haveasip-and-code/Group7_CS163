University of San Diego-a top 100 university in the greatest city on earth. Often called one of the most beautiful campuses on earth, it sits on top of a hill overlooking the ocean and looks like a castle with a huge church built in the middle. With a 2 to 1 girl to guy ratio (rumored to have the 2nd hottest girls ranked by Playboy) and just minutes from downtown San Diego and Tijuana, the location of the school is unbeatable.
