Typical Emenim: ; 'I hate life!! ; That's why I rapped about your wife!! ; That's why I can rap about hate! ; And complain about my screwed up fate!! ; F**k you all, who listen to me, because I'm drunk and I've got to, like, [totally] pee. ; I can rap so damn good! ; And my fakeass attitude makes me sound like I should! ; If I wanna be accepted by blacks from da hood! ; Maybe I oughta get with Dre and grovel! ; Like an old lady that hobbles!'
