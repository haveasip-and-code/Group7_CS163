nonconformist
Contrary to popular belief, there IS such a thing as a nonconformist. However, they ARE rare. True nonconformists conform to their OWN ideas (which, in reality is not conforming at all). Sinse they only conform to themselves, they come in all different forms, depending on what type of person they are. In short, a nonconformist is a totally honest and transparent person who says what they think does what they want.
