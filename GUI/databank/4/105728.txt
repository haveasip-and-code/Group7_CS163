flaqualate [pronounced flack-a- late]
The word is flaqualate. This word has been very useful to a number of people in describing a feeling, and an action. ; A woman walked outside to sit by the grass. There she found a bird on the ground who flapped and struggled and stressed and could not improve her condition. She could not re compose herself or fly. The woman was concerned and took the bird to a vet and asked for help. The next day she told me the story of this bird and tried to describe the (ascribed) feelings and real actions of this little bird. She created this new word.
