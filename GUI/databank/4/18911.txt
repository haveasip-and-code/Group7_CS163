jersey shore
A disgusting place full of disgusting people. Many people in eastern PA go there, only because it's so close, and then bitch constantly about how much they hate it. It is extremely crowded and there is no high-end luxurious place to stay. Often referred to as the opposite of the French Riviera or the worst beaches/shores in the world.
