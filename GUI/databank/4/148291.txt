der kommissar klub
A club where several people form a team and [goose step] to the song 'Der Kommissar' by the late Austrian rock star [Falco]. This is accomplished by use of a designated boombox carrier (see [gimp]) and a marching group. Membership in the club is highly restrictive, and their rights of passage are largely unknown. It is likely that the mystique of the Der Kommissar Klub will remain well into this century.
