2 rappers from Queensbridge going by the names of havoc and prodigy. I believe this group is incredibly talented, demonstrated by Shook ones pt 2 and quiet storm. However 2pac's beef hurt them during his reign. i believe now is their time. I think they have incredibly mellow beats for songs entitled 'hell on earth' and 'survival of the fittest' but in a sense that's good- perfect chilling music. They even made 50 cent sound half good in their remix of outta control. Maybe they can bring some talent to G-unit records. they've been here from the start and i believe are hip hop legends alongside Jay-z and Nas. had they not beefed with 2pac, i believe they could have been very big. but maybe they could've lost their street reality so i guess the beef was necessary.
