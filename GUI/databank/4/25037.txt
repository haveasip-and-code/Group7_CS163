Wylie's
A bar in Geneva, New York. Ever see the video for Guns and Roses 'Paradise City'? Well, that's Wylie's! Beautiful women practically live in that place. Wylie's looks like a palace, and in many ways, it is a palace...it is a palace of beautiful females, who like to drink and fuck. The ratio of women to men is about 10 to 1, and if a guy can't get a woman there, he's got to be gay!
