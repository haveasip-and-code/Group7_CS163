Dead Like Me
Dead Like Me is an awesome show on Showtime about A girl named George(Ellen Muth) who is hit by a toliet seat and becomes a Grim Reaper. Her merry band of reapers includes her boss Rube(Mandy Patinkin), The fuck-up Mason(Callum Blue), Tough-as-Nails cop Roxy(Jasmine Guy), and a wannabe actress named Daisy(Laura Harris). ; Unfortunately, this wickedly funny show has been cancelled by Bob Greenblatt(see [Devil's Spawn])and unless something is done, one of the last great shows on TV will die.
