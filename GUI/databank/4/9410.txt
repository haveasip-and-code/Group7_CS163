coligan
1) (n.) A severely complex oxymoron. One who has a innummerable body mass, yet, simply cannot pound the slightest bit of beer without passing out simultanously. Often this creature talks way too much trash to make him/herself feel better, will try to get with any person who has two legs and fail miserably, and is striving to earn an associate degree at a highly credible community college ( [sarcasm] ). ; 2) a worthless piece of shit
