Collar Popping Syndrome
An epidemic that is spreading across private schools across America. Rich fuckups that feel the need to protect their necks are especially likely to contract Collar Popping Syndrome, or C.P.S. The disease involves a person wearing a button down shirt with the collar flicked up. Not only is this hazardous to personal health but it is also a mortal sin. Anyone, preppy or not, who catches C.P.S. will surely be damned for it.
