waste of skin
A person so useless, worthless, and pointless that it's a shame they're taking up perfectly good skin some poor burn victim could be using. ; See also [waste of biomass], [waste of carbon], [waste of food], [waste of life], [waste of oxygen], [waste of semen], and [waste of space], but oddly enough not '[waste of makeup]', which is mostly used by... wastes of skin.
