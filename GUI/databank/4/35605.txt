Fentanyl
One of the most strongest narcotic agents ever developed. Its 40x more potent than heroin and is often sold on the street as heroin, causing many an accidental death. It comes are Duragesic patches and as lollipops (no joke). The amount of fentanyl in a Duragesic patch is enough to kill a person if they would ingest it directly.
