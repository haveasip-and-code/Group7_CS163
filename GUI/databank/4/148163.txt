statistics
also known as a useless subject one is forced to do to complete one's degree in Capitalism 1001 so one can get a piece of paper at the end of four years to be part of a globalised world so one can feed one's children (if one chooses to have any) and live happily ever after. ; so if one does not do statistics one will lead a sad and lonely life.
