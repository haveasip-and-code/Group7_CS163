maddox.xmission.com
A website that needs no introduction...what? There's a few retards who don't know? Gah...The website is the creation of a kick-ass pirate called [Maddox]. It is a collection of articles that he has written about things that piss him off. Naturally, unless you have no brain, most of the articles shouldn't be taken seriously. But the rest should be taken seriously, like how much ass [Ben Stiller] kicks and why [Cameron Diaz] sucks. ; If you are interested in looking, go to maddox.xmission.com (no www). If you're going to send hatemail, don't bother, Maddox doesn't care. Why do you think they put a delete button on your keyboard? :)
