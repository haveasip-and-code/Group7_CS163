Devon prep
School that sucks at everything. None of their sports teams are good. They are known for being 'smart' although they really arn't. The school doesn't even have a freaking football team, much less any other sports that count. And the few they do have, they suck at. Their grades arn't much different compared to Malvern's. And many of them have more beemers then bill gates. Devon people suck at life... therefore... the suck at everthing
