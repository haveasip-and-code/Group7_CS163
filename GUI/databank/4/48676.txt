Accelerando.exe
Speedster Net Navigator and prototype/elder brother to [Quickman.exe] on fan site Mega Man Battle Network Universe. Wields a buster. Originally had a wristblade, but switched to earphone whip after amputation of left arm in combat. Highly maneuverable. While non-elemental, can wield shots of any element.
