Arizona Republic
1. Arizona's/Phoenix's most popular newspaper and, conincidentally, the worst newspaper on the planet. ; 2. A Phoenix paper in which death counts of soldiers in Iraq are A10 news, and some bullshit about AIMS testing is A1/front page news. ; 3. A Phoenix paper which publicly endorsed Bush during the election of 2004, effectively killing any reputation it had for unbiased/non-partisan reporting.
