JROTC
an elective class in high school in which all the students of that class wear the same uniform every wednesday. ; it is, as most people agree, impossible to fail because there are no hard tests and all you have to do is shave and get a trim tuesday night, or whenever you want to before wednesday (as you have to to be 'presentable). ; when you join the class, all you can talk about is the class, and it reflects upon your conversational skills ; the class teaches students to be like the [air force], and the instructors take its campiness like its serious. ; Fact: John Jay HS in San Antonio ([Spurstown]) has the largest Air Force ROTC unit anywhere ; do not get into a fight with an ROTC cadet, as ROTC works like a gang, and every member will be on you
