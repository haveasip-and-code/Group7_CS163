skunk fucker
Derogatory term for a [furry]. Originated in the early 80's by protesters of some of the first furry [convention]s. This is largely due to the higher focus on such Warner Brothers characters as Pepe le Pew and Fifi le Pew at this time. As the focus of furry art has broadened since then, the term has largely fallen out of common useage.
