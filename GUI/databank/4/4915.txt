autumn teeth
a phrase posted by a stupid trailer cunt who didn't think I'd find it! A name used when a trailer trash whore gets jealous and can't even be creative. Typically a phrase used by someone suffering from a combination of trailer fumes and fumes from cheapy heating devices... we all know how cold it gets up in the backwoods of Maryland near PA... did you really think I wouldn't be able to tell that Storm Hunter is either Melinda or whipped trailer trash second hubby Jeff!???
