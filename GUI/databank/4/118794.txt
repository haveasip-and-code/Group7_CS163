New Britain
Hard Hittin' New Britain. Huge town, but if you ask many who live there, they will say small, because word of mouth spreads EXTREMLY quickly. ; Broad Street is the center of Polish life. Club Arkadia is the 'place to be' Saturday nights with the techno pumpin', and sexy girls all over the place. The New Britain Hurricanes are the number one high-school football team in the state. Home to Central Connecticut State University and its Blue Devils. Bordering Southington is the New Britain Reservoir - best spot to cliffjump - just don't get caught. Probably the only city in the world with pimped out cars with rims that are worth more than the cars themselves. 8th largest city in Connecticut. Teenagers have gotten quite creative at New Britain High, when they want some time off from school they just call in a bomb threat. Lots of parks .. with woods .. great places to hold illegal bonfires .. until the fire department comes. There is no Wendy's; it is very disappointing. We've got Capitol Lunch. We've got Guida's Milk. The superintendent doesn't like to call snowdays .. even when there are crazy blizzards and you're snowed inside your house. ; Geographically, it's close to .. everywhere. The beach, New York City, Rhode Island, Mass., malls, movie theaters, ice-skating rinks, and great nightclubs are all close by. ; As much as some may complain about living there, it's a good place to call home. =)
