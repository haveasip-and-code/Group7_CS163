elon
elon is full of rich rich kids who think their mommys and daddys can get them out of any mess. and they can. everyone is preppy preppy...lacoste, polo, jcrew, vineyard vines- the only way to go. sevens jeans, citizen of humanity, paper denim- the perfect jeans for the girls. any thing from Mynt is appropriate. they also spend the appropriate amount of time at A+tans. every girls tote bag is monogrammed and an herve or vera bradley. the girls sport their greek letters 7 days a week. 110% pin is common on bags, jackets, and shirts. students spend their evenings getting drunk-- pregaming in danieley suites or dorm rooms or the occassional fraternity house then heading to the bar. (west end mug nights on wed. and 50cent draft on mondays) weekends are full of parties in sheridan, off campus houses, fraternity houses, etc. many students party 6 nights a week. the other side of the party student is pulling all nighters in club belk, staying there until the sunrises to get all the work done that they procrastinated. and if you go to elon you know that there are NO straight paths. the campus is beautiful, best ever, but you can't get anywhere in a straight line. if you're lucky enough to visit elon on a pretty sunny warm day, you'll see tons of girls laying out in bathing suites by lake mary nell, or students throwing a frisbee out on the main lawn (the boobs) or people having a slip n slide in danieley. elon students definitely know how to party. if you're smart and choose to go to elon, you should definitely join a sorority or fraternity, but only one of the top ones. and believe me, you'll know which ones those are. ; a tip: get to know the police officers. if you're nice to them, they'll be nice to you.
