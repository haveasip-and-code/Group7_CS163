crackwagon
Jim Rome Jungle Gloss for the Dallas Cowboys, circa 1995. ; Evolved from the Cowboys' promotional slogan 'America's Team'. ; 'America's Team' became 'America's Bandwagon' (due to so many out of town fans hopping on the Cowboys' bandwagon). 'America's Bandwagon' was then shortened to 'Bandwagon'. After several Cowboys' players were arrested for various drug offenses, 'Bandwagon' was renamed 'Crackwagon' in reference to Michael Irvin's drug of choice.
