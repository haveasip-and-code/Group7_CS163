Team America: World Police
An incredibly hilarious, and SATIRICAL film created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It parodies modern America's overzealous actions in foreign countries, and their governments incredibly imperialist, and destructive nature. If you haven't seen this movie you are an asshole, and you must see this movie right now! Stop reading and watch this movie! America, FUCK YEAH!
