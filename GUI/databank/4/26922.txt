Censorship
An evil to society. Now they censor everything in the US fucking A. Just because a bunch of dumb religious parents don't want their kids to know what a penis is doesn't mean the rest of society should be prevented from knowing. Plus many things censored are natural instincts (sex, masturbation, etc.) and therefore people will find ways to learn about them, even with censorship.
