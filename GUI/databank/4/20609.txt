Britain
Britain, a nation that is made up of several countries, such as, [England], [Scotland], [Wales] and [Northern Ireland] - as much as they don't admit it, we stole that fair and square. ; It's a nice place, with locations that will satisy everyone, it's a place with lots of world building history - shame about the weather though. It's the only place that uses the English language properly, but do excuse the accents, could be worse though, could be speaking like the silly [aussies] and [Americans].
