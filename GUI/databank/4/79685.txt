The Simpsons
The first episode (Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire) aired for the first time on December 17, 1989. But this was only the first full episode. Before this episode, there were shorts, that began airing in April of 1987 on the Tracy Ullman Show and stopped in May, 1989. This show was the first of its kind and it raised all sorts of controversy. Before The Simpsons, all cartoons were child-friendly, but this was the first cartoon show concerning adult themes not suitable for children. 17 seasons in, The Simpsons is the longest running sitcom of all time, and it's still a great show, but I noticed Homer is no longer reluctant to swear. Before (Homer the Heretic - August 10, 1992) in the one that Homer doesn't go to church and he accidentally sets his house on fire, he's in the shower and looks both ways before he says, 'you bet your sweet...ASS.' Matt Groening also went on to create Futurama, which is also an incredible funny show. ; I don't care what any of you think, but the Simpsons are and always will be the greatest T.V. family. I love the show to death, the only reason I'm even passing English is because I memorized everything Lisa says and this show basically raised me. Family Guy is shit. Everything on that show is cheap crap and a lot of it is just storylines stolen from the Simpsons (EX. I know a lot of people are going to go NO WHAT DID FAMILY GUY STEAL!?!? well here's a beautiful example: Episode that Santa's Little Helper got that girl dog pregnant, and he went on the track and started humping her, Brian did the EXACT same thing). The worst episode of the Simpsons is better than the best episode of Family Guy. The show is desperately lacking in humor these days, but I still love it and I always will, and I will stay with it until its painful defeat and after, when nothing is left but clips on that 'Back In...' show on channel 64.
