moxy fruvous
'Moxy Fruvous', the best of Canadean demi-Rock 90's 60's folk pop that missed their calling by about 30 years. Still, that doesn't exclude Moxy Fruvous from being one of the best folk rock bands out there. The Fruvs have something for everyone, from witty political satire to social commentary, to beautiful vocal solos and a capella songs, to eye-wattering lyrics, all of which combine to give you the most talented musicians in the genre. Their best album by far is 'Bargainville', their first full CD. It delivers a perfect blend of comedy with love ballads and some good old liberal passion, all backed by the most stunning vocal harmonies of all their CD's, with the possible exception of their live compilation. The Fruvs are called so only by a couple their most endeering fans.
