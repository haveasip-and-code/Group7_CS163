pool shark
The best pool [playa]. Person who shoots pool so well that they rule the table for hours on end. Uses defense, mad [english], doesn't [talk shit], and grabs the ball for opponent when she [scratches]. And always shakes the persons hand and thanks them for a great game when they kick your ass.
