tatnall hornets
a school in greenville delaware where students go when their parents dont know what to do with their money. Beware: do not step foot into this school unless you are wearing your new polo (collar popped)and a fresh tan (guys included). These hornets excell in such sports as soccer and lacrosse, to name a few. fellow hornets can be heard saying 'good' before and after every sentence and 'where did you' in occasional conversation. Hornets buzz around Greenville convinced that they own the town, and when you need to find them look behind the BBC parking lot...
