a tribe called quest
Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad. One of - if not the best - hip-hop groups to ever exist. Pioneers of the D.A.I.S.Y. (Da Inner Sound Y'all) genre of hip-hop along with [De La Soul]. Also a part of the Native Tongues Posse. They forged the gratest hip-hop album of all time (IMO): 'The Low End Theory'
