dub dub dub
'Dub dub dub' is short for '[WWW]' which in turn is an abbreviation for 'World Wide Web.' '[WWW],' however, contains nine syllables whereas 'World Wide Web' contains only three. 'Dub dub dub' therefore is a shortened form of an abbreviation for those who don't want to say 'World Wide Web.'
