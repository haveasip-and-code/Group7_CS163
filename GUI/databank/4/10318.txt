Bam margera
I professional skateboarder from West Chester , PA. He and his friends made the hit shows and movies Jackass, CKY, and Viva la BAM. ; BAM is a good skater, but he is way too Overrated......Kids who play Tony Hawk video games and watch too much CKY/viva la bam think that BAM is the god father of skateboarding.
