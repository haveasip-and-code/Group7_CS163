Lemming
A group of guys and girls who have too much money (from there parents, family etc) and think they are god's greatest gift. The money has come into their families in the last generation or so and they don't know how to spend it. So they follow each other's lead. They are known to flash their money in a 'common' and obvious way. They generally wear von dutch if they are guys and juicy clothes if they're girls. They can't live without fake tan. They're mothers have botox and drive porsche 4x4. Basically, they're 'posh chavs'. They are known to be stupid and snobbish, they are liked by no one but others like them.
