Eggrito
Created by Matt one night when he was craving both Chinese food AND burritos. Lynn then presented him with burritos shaped like egg rolls from Chili's. The heavenly food was christened as the Eggrito and was also proclaimed by Matt as to be the name of his son if he ever had a half-Mexican, half-Chinese child.
