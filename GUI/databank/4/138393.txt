body nazi
The people around you that obsess about going to gyms. The type of guys and girls who look down upon those who don't make a vain attempt to be 21 again. ; The guys who fit in this category are similar to Uncle Rico off Napoleon Dynamite; in the fact that they can't stop admiring their biceps when their arms are folded. The girls usually live in fear of stretch marks and [bingo wings], and see themselves as high-flying corporate figures or Ally McBeal wannabes.
