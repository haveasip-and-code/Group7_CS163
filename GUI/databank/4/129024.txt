Woodcliff Lake
Small New Jersey town in the Pascack Valley part of Bergen County. There's a strip mall (that used to be a farm) with an Anthropologie, JCrew, Banana Republic, Panera Bread, Victoria's Secret, The Gap and not much else. North American or World Headquarters of all of the following: Mercedes, BMW, Ingersoll Rand, Barr Lab (thank them for birth control), KPMG, A&P and a few other big corporations. Close to Paramus: land of many shopping malls. Also, not far from New York City, where we gain our culture. We don't have our own high school, we got to Pascack Hills in Montvale, with kids from Montvale, which is part of the Pascack Valley Regional High School District, the first public school in NJ to get laptops for each student. We have no downtown, so we hang out in Westwood or Ridgewood. Mostly Westwood. We are obsessed with frozen yogurt. Semi-jappy and filled with Mcmansions. Land of many doctors and lawyers. 7th grade is all about the bar/bat mitzvahs. Oh and we have no cute boys. Absolutely no cute boys. However, not a horrible place to spend a childhood. Boring as hell, but safe.
