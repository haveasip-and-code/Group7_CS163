11-5/11-500
Let's set the record STR8!! 11-5 was originally a police code name for Heroine in particular, and narcotics in general. Back in the 1980's OG's from the Infamous East Oakland Turf known as Sobrante Park(SPG's) named their turf 11-5 because of all the dope dealing that was going on in that nieghborhood back in the days. Over ten years later, in the 90's a San Francisco rap group originally part of the rap group 'Cold World Hustlers' started calling themselves 11/5. Know your history people!
