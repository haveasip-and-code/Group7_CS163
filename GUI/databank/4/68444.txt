Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?
A question posed by Yossarian in Joseph Heller's Catch-22 to find out why so many people were working so hard to kill him. ; This seemingly rhetorical question is what one asks when one feels that everyone else is asking stupid questions and one wants to join in and/or point out how obviously stupid their questions are. Or, merely, because one wants to find out why so many people are working so hard to kill oneself.
