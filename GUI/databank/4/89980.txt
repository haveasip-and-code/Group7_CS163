Chemistry

In college, chemistry is used as a filter class to weed out ill prepared or unintelligent pre-meds and other technical field majors. Serves to re-route them to a more appropriate field such as sociology, business, or political 'science'. ; - A physical science dealing with the world of atoms and the molecules they form. Divided classically into 5 branches: physical, organic, inorganic, analytical, and biological.
