blade runner
1. A killer of simulated humans called REPLICANTS - clone robots genetically engineered to be way stronger and at least as smart as their creators. In the Ridley Scott movie, a police officer who is authorized to kill these beings is called a Blade Runner. ; 2. Blade Runner: Syd Mead did the concept art for this awsome flick based on Philip K Cicks novel 'Do Andriod Dream of Electric Sheep'. Best film ever according to millions of Science Fiction geeks, including me -- until DEADMAN -- a Jarmusch film starring Johnny Depp --outplaced it as the best film of all time.
