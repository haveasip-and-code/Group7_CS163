piratism
The act of pirating the high (and low) seas. Also can be applied to the act of pirating interstate highways. ; Not to be confused with [piracy], which is merely stealing music from already-rich musicians, who really shouldn't get their panties in a bundle because someone downloaded one of their songs to see if they actually wanted to buy their crappy music.
