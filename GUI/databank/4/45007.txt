Maury Povich
Host of the 'Maury' daytime talk show series. Show usually contains corny subjects such as: ; 1. 'I have slept with 63 men, and I need to tell my husband!' ; 2. 'Beaten, shot, raped, and burned. And I'm alive to tell!' ; 3. 'I don't think my son is my husband's.' ; 4. 'Man or Woman' ; 5. 'My baby is 235 pounds, and I need help!' ; Notorious for it's large African-American viewership, and it's notoriously low ratings, Maury has been the butt of jokes since it's inception. ; Maury Povich is married to embarassment-of-a-journalist Connie Chung and is usually busy putting up with her.
