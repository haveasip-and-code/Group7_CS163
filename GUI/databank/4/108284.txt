pen 15 club
a gradeschool prank usually you would write: ; Pen ; 15 ; on your hand, then ask if they wanted to join the pen15 club. it worked best if you had a bunch of people do it. then you would get them to go through the secret ceramony where you would write 'pen15' in the so that it looked like you wrote 'Penis' and you would point and laugh. best done with sharpie marker.
