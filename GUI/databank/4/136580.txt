Treemo
Basically, a cross between a [trendy] and an [emo]. They pretend to be emo and do emo things but only to be part of a branch of popular modern youth culture. Then again, if a Treemo realises that they are only a sheep and that their only purpose in life is to pretend to be like other people then they may evolve into an emo.
