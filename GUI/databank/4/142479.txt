A-Gay
Pertaining to an elite society of gay men who pride themselves on an extreme sense of class, style, fashion, and glam. See [katherine hepburn]. Prefer diamonds over cashmere, cardio over bagels, and flirting over coffee. Not considered a [Nancy], but sometimes a [Mary]. Can always be counted on for the lastest in premium insults, scandal, and fashion hip-tips. See [Queer Eye].
