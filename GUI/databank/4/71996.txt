Throughout history, it has been controlled by the Europeans, China, and Japan. ; Recently, due to the increasing popularity of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan has been pushing for independence. This is due to the corrupt and ineffective rule of the ruling KMT party that escaped from mainland China after the Communist Party took over China. ; Taiwanese people are known to have a lot of national pride and are ardent in shoving down their 'TAIWAN > CHINA omg I WANT TO FELLIATE TAIWAN!!11 CHINA sUx0rZ!!1'.
