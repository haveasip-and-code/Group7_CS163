fringebear
A Big bear that comes into your house the night before you get your passport photo taken and uses its scissor hands to remove a piece of your fringe. It is so small you dont notice it when you wake up but it all becomes clear when you look at your passport photos from the chemists. ; [www.fringebears.tk]
