Anchorage
Biggest city in Alaska. Anchorage has roughly half the population in the state and is the starting place for the infamous Iditarod dog sled race. Winters are typically in the 30's and 20's with good snow. Summers are usually cloudy and in the high 50s, low 60s. ; Unlike any other city in the United States because its sales tax-free and has the most beauty. A growing rap and rock scene in the United States for sure.
