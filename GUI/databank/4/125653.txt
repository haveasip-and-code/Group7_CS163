Casting Churchill's reflection
The act of creating the likeness, in the water of a toilet bowl, of the British Prime Minister (1940-45 and 1951-55) Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965), when expelling a [brown trout]. The role of his face is played by your fat arse, while your [dog's egg] is a stand in for the cigar protruding from his lips.
