From First to Last
Let me set all of you straight. ; From First To Last do not really consider themselves screamo. ; They say more post-hardcore. ; Also, Sonny Moore is 17. Not 16. And not 15. ; The band consists of; ; Sonny - Vocals ; Matt - Vocals/Guitar ; Travis - Throat/Guitar ; Jon - Throat/Bass ; Derek - Growl/Drums. ; Their CDs, (plural, yes), ; arn't for emo people, thank you for your cockiness. ; And the lyrics may be too violent for emo pansies. ; Also, Matt Good, is NOT from Florida. He's from Georgia. ; And the lyrics are not, ; 'I'LL be hiding in the shadows, ; I'LL be waiting in the dark,' ; They're, ; 'I'VE been hiding behind the shadows, ; I'VE been waiting in the dark,' ; And those lyrics are from their DEBUT or full length album, Dear Diary. ; Asthetic was just an EP. ; And lastly, their latest album isn't Dear Diary. Their latest album hasn't been released yet, but it's planned to be released in late fall/early winter around the time they begin headlining in the US with the, 'Dead by Dawn,' tour. ; I believe I caught all the mistakes. ; Thanks for your time.
