breenebass
A 'breenebass' is a very small creature. Standing at about 3ft high, the breenebass is never seen without his treasured wooden crutches, which he uses to tap regular sized girls on the bottom. You could mistake the breenebass for a child, but it is firm belief all over Keighley that he is just a midget. Occasionally, this creature likes to wield his bass guitar, bounce around his bedroom and pretend he is in the well known rock 'n roll band, Status Quo.
