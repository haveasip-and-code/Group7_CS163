Iraqnophobia
An irrational fear of iraq, most common amoungst middle class americans living in the sourthern states of the USA. Symptons include believing what the media claims, voting republican, remembering 9/11 and calling those who disagree terrorists, despite iraq having no connection to either 9/11 or terrorists. ; Those who suffer from iraqnophobia often find that displaying a pointlessly large american flag on your house helps. It is unclear why iraqnophobics practice this ritual however.
