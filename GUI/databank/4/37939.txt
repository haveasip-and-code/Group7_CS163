Riverbend High School
I am a proud riverbend student and i am proud to say i buy my own liquor, and i've never asked a courtland kid to buy me alcohol. Also every party ive had was fully stocked with alcohol, smoke, and chicks. So courtland obviously is not invited to the real riverbend spots, not the crappy ones thrown by gay junior chicks who live in gated communities.
