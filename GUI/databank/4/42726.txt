candyman
A potbellied regular at the [Disco 2000] party at [Limelight]. According to legend, he waited tables at TGIFriday's and used his earnings to buy large quantities of [cocaine] and [ketamine], which he would use to attract young ladies for [e-hugs] and further fondlings. According to legend, another clubkid, Jessie, got angry with him for breaking off a relationship at a BBQ in front of many mutual friends. Jessie put a curse on Candyman leading to his death. ; It is said that anyone who uses ketamine and says his name 3 times in the mirror at the Avalon (new name for limelight) nightclub, will see his ghost rising off the dancefloor at 3 AM, wearing the same old Pacific Sunwear outfit he was notorious for.
