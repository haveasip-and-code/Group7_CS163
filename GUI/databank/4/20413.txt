fobstache
Mustaches that FOBs (fresh off the boat) have at a very young age. Around their teen years. People with these fobstaches are usually found in Cyber Cafes playing Counter-Strike and other online-games. Beware, these people usually are older than they look and sometimes have a machete in their back pocket so be cautious.
