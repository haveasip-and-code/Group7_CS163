two step
A 'hardcore song' dance. You usually do it during the breakdown of a song. Similar to Skanking in punk/ska music. Different in every city/state like Nyc and New Jersey and Maryland etc... Dont get confused with the kids jumping around swinging there arms and legs trying to hurt eachother(stupid, i dont know what they are doing). That almost always ends up in a fight.
