Hip-pop
Music that some 'hip hop' artists produce...like those songs directed at girls or the rapper himself/herself does not show that they are good lyricist but somehow a favorite at the club, maybe its catchy and can be listened by those 'white folk' that say 'I like hip hop, I listen to' so and so but they have no idea about the hip hop culture. I think those artists cannot be looked as one who wins battles or is very influential. I think 50 cent and Eminem are becoming a trend but if you listen to their other tracks on their albums or mixtape sh*t they show their skills(I think Em is a very talented becuz of his 'Big Daddy Kane sh_t' he makes words you wonteven condsider to rhyme and makes it work. He uses his prononciation to the fullest) not like other artists, who i think are like hip hop knock-offs. No skills...check. Known to just about everyone...check. Soft...check!
