Thursday
Commonly known as 'thirsty thursday' a day of the week when no matter what time you have class on friday, you see it as a challenge to get as drunk as possible and make it to class with a major hangover or if you are extremely successful you just keep drinking and go to class drunk. ; To many Thursday is seen as a challenge and not a time to get drunk because fellow class mates really appreciate someone stumbling into class on Friday morning.
