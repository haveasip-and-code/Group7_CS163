funball
A ripoff of baseball played by a few dudes and a few babes with a tennis ball and a Vortex Mike Piazza plastic, foam cushioned baseball bat. The game is played on a public little league field, therefore creating the neccessary need to hide your beer in a paper bag. Your team gets a point when a ball drops in the outfield without being caught. There are fielders from both teams in the outfield. If your teammate catches the ball, your team gets 2 points. If the opposing catches the ball you lose a point and get an out. You can play with 5 or 10 outs. Depends on how lazy you are. If the pitcher catches an infield fly ball, the scores reverse.
