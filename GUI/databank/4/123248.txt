Early Entrance Program
A program hosted by the Robinson Center for Young Scholars at the University of Washington which accepts 16 7th and 8th graders to enter the UW early. Students must go through an one-year intensive transition school (TS) prior to entering the university. Most Early Entrance Program students thrive in the university environment, contrary to popular stereotypes of entering college early.
