couchetard
A more affectionate way of calling someone a [retard] or a [douchetard]. Meant as an insult, but not as a serious one; often used between friends. ; Inspired by Couche-Tard, the Canadian convenience store chain. 'Couche-tard' is French for 'night owl', literally meaning 'goes to bed late.' But because of its similarity in sound to the English insult [douchetard], 'couchetard' was converted into an English-language insult with a meaning similar to [douchetard] but less offensive -- even bordering on affectionate. ; Also 'couchetarded', adj.
