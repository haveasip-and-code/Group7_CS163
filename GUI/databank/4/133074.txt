poverty
1. The preferred state for most minorities and Democrats by the Republican party. ; 2. The lack of morals exhibited by the old men and oil companies who run the economy. ; 3. Having enough money for weed but none for lighters or rolling papers. ; 4. The vow taken by members of the Roman Catholic Church (you know them, right? Biggest land-owners on the planet?)
