Clit
Abbreviation of the word '[Clitoris]'. A sensitive little bump at the top of the female genitalia. Very few men realise it exists, & those who do seem to think that prodding it once or twice will have women rocketing their way to multiple orgasms. The clitoris is not, however, fictional. It does exist, contrary to what most men think...
