Porsche 944
An excellent car. ; Due to a balancing shaft and a transaxle design boasting 50/50 balance, the RWD Porsche 944 is a very fun car to drive. The later S2 boasts 6-pot calipers and the world's largest production 4 cylinder, coming in at 3.0l. Filled with a well designed, ergonomic, aesthetically pleasing German interior, this car is still a good buy today. Not the fastest but in turbo and S2 variants, fast enough to beat much younger sports cars, including MX-5's, Preludes, etc; not to mention any van.
