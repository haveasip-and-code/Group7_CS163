shawty
The word SHAWTY was originated in Atlanta. It is used as a PRONOUN! Not to describe a person! But as a name so if u cant think of a person's name you'd say 'Man, u dont remember SHAWTY that used to live on Flat Shoals?' or just when u are refering to a person in place of he or she... It's kinda like sayin [Man] [Dog] [Dawg] [Folk] [Buddy] [Girl]
