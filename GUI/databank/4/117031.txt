enter the dragon
one of the greatest martial arts classics ever made. starring the late, great bruce lee, it features a nonsensical plot, ridiculous dialogue and great martial arts. it follows Lee's plan to infiltrate a tournament organised by a rogue shaolin monk and defeat him, along the way avenging his sister's murder and releasing an imprisoned army of martial artists (go figure) also features a very cool Afro sporting karate hero and a fairly cool white guy, in short, an undeniable classic.
