Fidel Castro
fidel castro is a common reference made towards people who think they are really cool and funny, but in actuality, they are not. when a 'fidel castro' is spotted, it is usually quite hilarious because their stupidity is actually able to be seen by the human eye. it's like an aura. and, as most of us now, people really that dumb, are just plain HILARIOUS to look at. their very existance makes me want to weep tears of apathy.
