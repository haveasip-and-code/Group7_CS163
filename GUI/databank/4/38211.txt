Aeropostale
a very boring store that has butterflies and monkeys all over everything and is directed toward 11 year old girls and people with no sense of individuality and style. it's also the worst place to work for considering they make you stay until 12 in the morning folding clothes, and thats if they close at nine. if you've ever been in one you know that employee that stalks you and pitches you the product of the day and you want to punch them in the face.
