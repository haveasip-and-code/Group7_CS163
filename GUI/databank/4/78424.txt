bully
a lesser being of evolution who has to physically or mentelly abuse a poor defenceless person to make him or herself fell good. They get off and hurting the younger or more fragile human beings. All bullies are are prejudice assholes who don't even know a person yet get off by pointing out physical faults. i made up a small poem about bulling ; 'Bulling isn't big and it isn't clever but no matter how much anybody tries it will be around forever' :-( i know i have been bullied for ten years physically and mentally and the old saying2sticks and stones may brake my bones but words will never hurt me' is a load of SHIT!!!!! the scars may heel but the words stay in your heart and in your head forever!
