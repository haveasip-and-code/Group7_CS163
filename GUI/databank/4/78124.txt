salesianum
A high school in the fine town of Wilmington, Delaware that serioulsy sucks at life and needs to get its shit together. Some describe it as a college prepraratory institution, when in reality it amounts to little more than a gigantic, four-year sausage fest. Sallies guys like to think they're better than kids from other schools, specifically Tatnall. In this they are sadly mistaken, as Tatnall students are uniformly smarter, better-looking, and more sanitary. Sallies does have one thing going for it however: they cling to the slim hope that a meteor might one day crash into the earth and destroy only Sallies and its occupants, thus ridding the world of the scourge that is Sallies. Mkay.
