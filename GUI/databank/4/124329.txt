triad
The Sun Yee On Triad, Flying Dragons, Ghost Shadows, Wah Ching, Wo Hop To Triad, 4 Seas, are considered Triads because they're Chinese blooded. They can do organized crime like the Italian Mafia, as well as blast at people, jump people, rob people, shoot out rival gangbangers just like black gangs, & vatos do. The younger heads, that can be just 13 damn years old, do the dirty work for the Dai Lo's to earn their respect. They're usually marked in the gang by showing loyalty, getting tattoos, and cigarette/insense burns all over the body. Prostitution and gambling is the bread and butter for most Triads.
