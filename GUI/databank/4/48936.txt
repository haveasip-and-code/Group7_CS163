CED
The 'Capacitance Electronic Disc' system, invented by RCA; also known as 'SelectaVision' and 'video records.' ; RCA was trying to edge out the pre-existing VHS and LaserDisc formats, but ultimately failed in the long run. The format lasted from 1981 until 1986, and about 1700 titles were released on CED. ; Movies came in large plastic caddies, which you inserted, as a whole, into a CED player, which disengaged the disc from the caddy when you pulled it back out (so you wouldn't touch the disc with your bare hands, which could cause disc damage.) A stylus picked up the audio/video data from the disc, which spun at 450 RPM. ; To remove the videodisc, you simply push the caddy back into the player, and the disc re-engages itself in the caddy. ; Like a CLV laserdisc, CEDs have one hour of content on each side... but you must remove and re-insert the disc upside-down, to continue playing (like with the early laserdisc players.) ; If a film ran over two hours by a significant amount of time, it was released on a set of two CEDs. Otherwise, time compression was used to fit the movie onto one disc. ; The estimated life of a CED videodisc is 500 playings. Not too bad.
