Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the coastal plain of which has vast oil reserves and very little vegetation. Environmentalists are pissed that we are going to use 2000 acres of this barren land to explore and extract oil. Never mind the fact that the population of caribou has increased in Prudhoe Bay, a place far less environmentally friendly than what ANWR will be.
