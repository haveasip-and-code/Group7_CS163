alien ant farm
Alien Ant Farm is a wonderful band that has had very little recognition; a lot less than it deserves, other than the infamous cover of Michael Jackson's 'Smooth Criminal' in 2001. Dryden Mitchell provides unique, addictive vocals and the music is unique and quirky. Their lack of popularity is astonishing; especially with 'artists' like Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte taking over radio stations all over the country.
