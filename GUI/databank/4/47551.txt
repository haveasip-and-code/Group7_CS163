River Phoenix
One of the best young actor of his time. Sure, this guy was EXTREMELY hot, but thats not all there was to him. He was an AMAZING actor. Best films included Stand By Me, My Own Private Idaho and Running on empty, among many others. No doubt, that if he had not died of a drug overdose on October 31, 1993, he would be considered one of the greatest actors of this time, along with the likes of Johnny Depp.
