Mainstream VS Underground
The legendary childish battle of Mainstream and Underground has been rooted itself into the modern world of western pop culture for as long as it has been around. ; The two opposing sides, Mainstream and Underground, battle a hidden age long war between each other, some completely unaware of this raging war. Anything an Undergrounder considers to be corporate, or money making becomes Mainstream, and anything a Mainstreamer believes to be odd or extreme becomes Underground. ; Originally based loosely on modern contemporary music such as Mainstream Pop vs Underground Alternative etc, it has now spread to anything controversial that appeals towards teenagers and people under the age of 20. ; While most Mainstreamers are often clueless of what is actually going around them, and therefore being harmless, many Undergrounders (but not all) are well aware of their own alliance, and because of this, they often abuse situations where a Mainstreamer is seen in an Underground congregation.
