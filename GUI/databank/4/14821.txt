IFTA
Short for 'Fairfax County Summer Institute For The Arts' ; IFTA is a summer program offered to any rising 7th-12th graders living in Fairfax County. ; It is THE best way to spend the month of July. ; Held in Fairfax High School, a place that's confusing as hell if you've never been there, but once you've mastered it there are so many shortcuts and hising places and other fun stuff that you never want to leave. There is also a nearly obscene ammount of vending machines. ; Going to IFTA you will meet the greatest assortment of people ever. Artists, musicians, actors, dancers, singers, triple-threats, punks, goths, weirdos, ravers, gays, and all manner of other cool people. ; The administration really dosen't care what you do as long as you show up for your classes. This means that don;t care when people come wearing kilts, suits, sporting 3 foot fauxhawks, sitting on the floor with a mini TV plugged into the wall so they can play nintendo, running around the halls singing, breakdancing, etc. ; Concerts in the courtyard during lunch are courtesy of 'Making The Band' which is a class made up of rock musicians who also happen to be all of IFTA's worst trouble makers. ; For those who understand, IFTA is the greatest thing on earth.
