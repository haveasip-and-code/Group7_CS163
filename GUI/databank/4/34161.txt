Noodles from China. Sold in six packs, or individually for about $.17 at most grocery stores. Come in a variety of flavors, but all manage to taste the same. I prefer chicken myself, microwaved for approx 3 mins. so that the noodles aren't completely done, just halfway! Sometimes I cook them in a big pot and add alot of salt, pepper, and extra flavor packs, which I raid from my room mates supply! YUM!!!
