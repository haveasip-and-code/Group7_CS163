Selinsgrove
The hub of the rural Central Susquehanna Valley, the word 'urban' doesn't really describe Selinsgrove. Famous for BJ's steak and ribs, the Strip, and the occasional flood, this town is the place to go for a Sheetz run, your Wal-mart needs, or a Rita's fix. Also known as the home of 'those damn college kids' and the epicenter of disillusionment with the assurances that someday, the bypass will be built. Locals tend to complain about traffic on the strip, and to like country music.
