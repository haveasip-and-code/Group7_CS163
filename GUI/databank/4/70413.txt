port angeles
An interesting town where half the people are hicks who want to cut down all the other trees and the other half are hippies who want to climb all the trees (This would be me). It is a beautiful area located in Western Washington, sandwiched between the Straits of Juan De Fuca and the Olympic Mountains. Many rivers and lakes are also close by.
