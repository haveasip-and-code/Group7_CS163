Error
Error is an expirimental/hardcore/electronica band from California. Like a scream looking for a mouth, Error tear through the five tracks on this e.p. pissing on the dying embers of what we have come to accept as hardcore today. If punk is change then Error is the future. This is the sound of man and machine but they do not live in harmony - infact one wonders whether Error is working with their equipment or fighting against it. ; In a time where the Empire strikes first and Clay Aitken can sell 700,000 in a week our discontent will not go unnoticed. Error turns these frustrations into sound.
