stride of pride
The stroll across campus after a one night stand. Usually slower and with more gusto than the [walk of shame]. Typically reserved for men as one night stands garner respect and bragging rights with your buddies. However, women can be seen doing the stride of pride after being rocked the previous night as opposed to the [one minute man] or dealing with [whiskey dick].
