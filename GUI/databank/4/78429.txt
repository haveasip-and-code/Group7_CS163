Elfwood
A site supposedly dedicated to art and fictional writing that is so bogged down by rules that its a wonder it has any members. At least it's free. ; The site is divided into Fantasy, Fan Art, and Writing sections; the writing section has some of the strictest rules, and is the least acsessible to outsiders.
