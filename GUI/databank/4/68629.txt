romper room
US children's TV show that was especially popular in the 70s. It took place in a kindergarten classroom and featured an uptight teacher named Ms. Suzy or something who would always make the kids say grace before they ate and also there was some guy who dressed up as a giant bee by the name of Do-Bee. He was supposed to set a good example for the kids ('Do be a Do-bee') but was very likely a pedophile.
