going doug
Going Doug is when you claim to take showers, but don't...ever. To go Doug, you also have to not wash your clothes....ever. In fact, you may occasionally defecate or masturbate in or on your clothes, yet still wear them to bed, and the next day. Extreme cases of going Doug also include sporting a bowl cut and being shaped like a pair or bell. This is an unwanted biproduct of the grunge era.
