Banda
Banda ; Banda ('band') refers to the form of music played by large brass ensembles that first appeared in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa several decades ago by German immigrants. Similar to Polka, a typical banda ensemble features trumpets, trombones, tubas, accordians and percussion instruments, and may include keyboards. String instruments are used sparingly, if at all. Banda sounds somewhat similar to American Big Band music, but with a distinctive Mexican twist. It's loved by [pollo]s, [paisa]s, [mojado]s,[frijolero]s,[tijuanero]s,[borracho]s, [wetback]s and [beaner]s everywhere.
