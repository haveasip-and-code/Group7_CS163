chango
A school that is part of Shenendehowa. Even though it's only an elementary school, it still has cliques. ; Cliques include: ; Popular kids: A bunch of immature snot nosed fuckwits who think they own everything in the school. ; Goths: A bunch of kids who masturbate to Good Charlotte, whilst slitting their wrists. ; Wiggers: A bunch of kids who are white, but they think they are black. ; Weird kids/nerds: The group of kids who look normal, but act 'weird' according to the popular kids. This the group I was placed in. ; Normal kids: Nothing special about them. ; The teachers are mainly nice, but one of the gym teachers owns a riced out Scion xB. ; In short, it's an okay school. Not the best, but okay.
