bandy
A member of the school [band]. Bandies usually hang out together, have inside jokes that nobody outside the band gets or understands (which are sometimes inexplicably used when not even in the presence of other bandies, leaving the bandy the only one to get the joke), and generally maintain their own sort of secret musicians' society. They may be friends with non-bandies/non-musicians, but when together with both bandies and non-bandies, they often talk about music-related subjects that the non-bandies don't understand, leaving the non-bandies out of the conversation. ; This term may also sometimes be used to refer to members of the school [orchestra].
