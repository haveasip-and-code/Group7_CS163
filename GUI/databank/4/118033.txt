Redwood Curtain
(adj) The Redwood Curtain (RC) is the extreme northwestern corner of California, i.e. the coastal counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino. The RC is the [norcal] version of the [Iron Curtain] in eastern Europe erected during the [Cold War] and is mostly used in a derogatory sense, whereby the RC symbolizes the area's lack of cultural or metropolitan qualities as well as poor transportation access, sparse development, rugged geography, and a weird provincialism among the native locals.
