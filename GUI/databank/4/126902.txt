old-fashioned shower
refers to the actual shower which came into existence in the early 1800s. In contrast to the modern shower ([shower in a can]), which although gives a great sense of freshness, is no match to the cleanliness achieved by taking an old-fashioned shower. The term 'old-fashioned shower' originated from The Stepbrother.
