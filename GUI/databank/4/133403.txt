Rocktober
An informal celebration of rock music taking place every year in the month of October. It may apply to any genre of rock and roll, however it is most often connected to the 'classic rock' genre. A typical Rocktober fan may be described as a beer-drinking, [mullet]ed and/or older rock aficionado.
