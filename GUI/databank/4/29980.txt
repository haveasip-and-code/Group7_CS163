ED
Acronym for 'Eurasian Dynasty', one of the three playable factions in 'Earth 2140' and 'Earth 2150'. Consisting of Europe and most of Aisa, the ED is the lowest tech faction in the game. Using old technologies of standard cannons, nukes, and lasers, they posses little else comparable to the [UCS] and [LC] technologies.
