Liverpool
In reposte to the previous definition, Liverpool are (officially) the most in-form football team in the English Premiership, 5 wins out of the last 6 games (that's even better than Chelski!) ; Also, to respond to the mindless fools who post about 'what a shithole' Liverpool is, I'd like to see where they come from. ; The city of Liverpool is currently experiencing investment on a massive scale which is precisely why it was nominated (and won) Capital of Culture for 2008 - the high streets are clean, the people are friendly, the museums are fantastic, there are more art galleries (8 in total) than anywhere in the UK (bar London.) ; Agreed, there are some 'scallies' about but tell me a city with 500'000+ inhabitants where you would't find any? ; FACT: The Liverpudlian accent is far more tolerable (and, according to neutral outsiders, more endearing) than any Mancunian inbred dribble. ; In conclusion, don't stereotype just because of some sketch you saw on Harry Enfield... I don't have a moustache, mullet and say, 'errrrrrr' every other sentence.
