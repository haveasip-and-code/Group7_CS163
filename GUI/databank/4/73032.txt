FaceParty
A personals site based in Britain, where people can post their photo for everyone to see, boast about themselves, pretend to be someone else, or indulge their narcissism to their heart's content. Tempted by offers of apparently non-existant parties in London, people sign up to find that the site encourages them to insult other members, deface their photographs, and steal things in exchange for jelly beans. Tragic.
