Shakers
Ultra-premium [vodka] produced in Minnesota. The standard version is made from wheat and is smooth tasting with a hint of vanilla; there are also rye (spicier finish) and rose-flavored (avoid it) versions available. Bottle is reminiscent of a classic martini shaker with a penguin on it. Step up from Grey Goose, Belvedere, and Schmirnoff, and not imported!
