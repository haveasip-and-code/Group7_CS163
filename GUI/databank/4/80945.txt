yags
used to describe a mellow environment. ; Was thought up by Peaer of the famouse graffitti mobb E.M.R. Since stealing was essential in the life of writers, they had to come up with a word that would not be understood by store employees.Since asking a partner'is it hot' was too obvious, 'yags' was then thought up and quicky replaced its synonym.
