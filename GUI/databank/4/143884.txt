Asexual
There are two general meanings. ; 1. The absence of a sexuality, most notably in humans. Some may just not be sexuallly attracted to others, otehrs may completely lack a sex drive or sexual desires. Common misconceptions are that such people have suffered sexual abuse, are emotionally frigid, are closet homosexuals, masturbate ten times a day, are too ugly to get in a sexual relationship or are impotent. This, more often than not, does not apply. ; 2. Without sexual intercourse. For example, cells (be it nerve cells, bacteria or other protozoa such as amoeba) reproduce via mitosis (or dividing) as opposed to sexual reproduction. The result tends to be two cells of exactly the same genetic structure as the 'parent cell', though genetic mutation can occur if the DNA is duplicated incorrectly. ; Connected words/phrases: asexuality, sexuality, sexual, mitosis, cell division, queer (asexuality is considered a queer sexuality. This is not a negatiive connotation, only meaning 'different').
