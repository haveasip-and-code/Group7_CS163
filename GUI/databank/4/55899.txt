Fargo
A wonderful city in the Upper Midwest. It is the county seat of Cass County, as well as the largest city in the state of [North Dakota]. The city is not really bad at all, as there are many other far worse and dangerous places in this country. The jackass who called it a shithole in his definition obviously implies that the city is horrible, but he is very wrong.
