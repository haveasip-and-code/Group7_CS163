Baldwin-Wallace College
Baldwin-Wallace College equals [big waste]. This urban myth is true. Upon visiting BWC, most students will like the atmosphere and think nothing of the brick buildings and dreay skies. After enrolling in BWC students will soon come to realize the large mistake they have made but by that time it is too late. For at least a semester you must survive the frigid weather, the 65% homosexuality rate, and the 16 week lecture class over 20 chapters in a $200 book with only 2 tests in the entire class. All in all BWC=[big waste].
