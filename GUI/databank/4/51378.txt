kirk hammet
a very talented guitarist from the very great band MetallicA. he is one of the best guitarists, but definately not THE best guitarist. the best guitarist is of course jimi hendrix, duh. and he is definately better than dave mustaine, who was kicked out of metallica because of his drug problems, and because he's an asshole. yes i know kirk hammet is over rated. he is rated on a scale from 1 to ten (ten being the best) as a 12, but in reality he is actually only an 11.
