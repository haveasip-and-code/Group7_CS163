Exile
A song that Slayer has produced that expresses my true feelings about my father, my interpretation of this song is about the pure hatred you have for one thing, though you have others you want to exile that one problem from the others and deal with it so that the problem will finally go away, this another Slayer song that I can relate to, and I did the same in my life I exiled my problem with my father and now everything is better
