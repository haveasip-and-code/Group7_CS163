Washington DC
DC is divided up into four quadrants. NorthWest DC, SouthEast,SouthWest,and NorthEast. Northwest is very rich for the most part, with the majority of homes selling for over a million dollars, more private schools than you could count and a very preppy population. Not much crime here. Dc is amazing except for all the goddamn tourists who try to ruin everything by being fat and obnoxious.
