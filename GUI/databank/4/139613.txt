superfippy
Superfippy is a contraction of 'superficial hippie'. This term is used to describe a certain breed of animal-rights advocates. Though protesting for animal rights is an honorable endeavor, superfippies only care about animals they think are cute. They don't protest animal testing or the destruction of habitat for moral reasons or because of the impact these things have on the environment. Superfippies only care about the safety of cute/fuzzy animals that they like. Some of these animals include dolphins, bunnies and chimps.
