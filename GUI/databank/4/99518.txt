fairfield
Full of yuppies and WASPS. We figured it out once; 70% of the children our blonde. We're not as rich as Westport but we pretend we're as cool by buying all our clothes there. Some kids in Fairfield live in a section called Southport. They are richer than the kids in Westport. Then theres those kids who think they're ghetto even the cheapest house in this town costs a little more than half a million dollars. If you live here and live the lifestyle you're either going to go to an Ivy, Boston College, Loyalo, Villanova or somewhere else similar. Either your daddy is a lawyer, a doctor, in 'finance', or sits on your couch all day because you inherited all your money. If you want to have friends do at least two of the five: ; 1) Drive a Lexus, Range Rover, or BMW while blasting Dave Matthews ; 2) Spend $100 on shirts with a little J zipper, an alligator, or a guy playing polo on them ; 3) Have keg parties at your mansion ; 4) Tell me where you buy your pot ; 5) Be neurotic about your grades and have a GPA 4.3 or higher
