hater vision
When a car has LCD monitors installed on the headrests in the absolute back row of the car, which cannot be, nor are not intended to be viewed by a passenger, but other divers on the road. The purpose of this is to show all the [haters] that you have so much money and are so extravagant that you can afford to install expensive car audio \ video equipment in order to show off.
