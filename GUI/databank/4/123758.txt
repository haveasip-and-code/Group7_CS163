RANCHO CUCAMONGA
Rancho Cucamonga is a very new, suburban and beautiful city, with a bad reputation only because it happens to be in the infamous [909]. It is nestled at the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains about an hour Southeast of LA. Many people that live here are white, have lots of money, and have children that spend it all. You can't get any home here for under $800,000. It's a great place to raise a family, seeing as everything worth visiting in Southern California is within about an hour or two and there are plenty of schools, parks (a new central park that should be in Beverly Hills), every single store you can think of and plenty of restaurants. The doctor for the WWF lives here, and Snoop Dogg lives about 10 minutes away. ; There is a huge mall that just got built in Rancho located on the East Side (Etiwanda) that everyone calls the VG. If you have a nice car, (ie. Porsche, Ferarri etc.) you will probably drive it through this mall to show it off. Going to the mall is pretty much all the high school students have to do, other than partying, drinking, working on their cars, going to In-n-Out, Starbucks or shopping. Rancho is also full of [Bro]'s with lifted trucks, [Emo] kids, plenty of really made up high school girls with Dior sunglasses and fake LV's, (especially ones that go to the three high school crammed within 5 miles of each other), Punkers, White trash that drive Hummers and [Abercrombie] and [Hollister] kids. If you don't drive a Mercedes or a BMW, know what Harvard on the Hill is, know what you do at the top of Haven, have gotten a ticket for jay-walking or have partied at the Haven Estates, you don't belong in Rancho. Sorry.
