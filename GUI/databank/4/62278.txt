Ring Damage
Ring Damage, the result of LORD (see separate definition) activity on a trading portfolio. Ring Damage is normally experienced the following morning & is a resultant of bouts of late night (& usually unsuccessful) outright trading. Ring Damage can become severe if the LORD activity goes unchecked. This may lead to long term & sometimes irreversible damage to the Ring. Ring damage can be insured for however.
