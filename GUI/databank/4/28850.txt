coco
Courtney Coxs' and David Arquettes' daughters name. Courtney must have been to exausted after giving birth to chose a normal name for baby, so she slapped together the first two letters of her first and last name...Hence the name, Coco. Lets just be thankful that her last name didn't begin with Ck...
