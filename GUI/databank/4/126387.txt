CFL
The Canadian Football League. It is so much better then the NFL and more exciting.Players dont get paid huge contracts for playing 16 games which is retarded. Players get paid 800,000 dollars which in my mind an awsome salary. The only differences between the NFL and CFL are: CFL has a slimmer field but longer. CFL has 3 Downs and 12 players instead of 11, we also have bigger footballs.
