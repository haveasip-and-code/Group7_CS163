cocaine plans
Future arrangements that are made while high on [cocaine]. Those that are on cocaine think it sounds like just the best idea in the world, but when the next morning rolls around they either forgot or are jonesing so bad that its the last thing in the world they want to do. Similar to a [party promise].
