Red Robot
A local band formed in Redding, California that played shows between 2001 and 2005. Inspired by bands like Fugazi, Radiohead, and At the Drive-In, the Red Robot is considered by many Northern California local music enthusiasts to be the best band to come out of Redding in memorable history. Band members were Tatton White (guitar/vocals), Mat Calderon(guitar/keyboard/vocals), Adam Prado(bass) and Noah G. Prado(drums). The Red Robot broke up in August of 2005, when Tatton White left the band to attend college.
