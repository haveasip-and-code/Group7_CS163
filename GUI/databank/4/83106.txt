Birkenstock Mafia
A seemingly loosely-knit group of lesbians on any and every online edifice for verbal war (i.e.: usenet, forums, online art communities) who, when one of them is even mildly insulted, will rain relentless hellfire upon the foolish, hapless mortal that seemingly made a newbie mistake, and any fool who may speak either on the behalf of the mortal, or attempts to calm the sisterhood. They are also trendsetters and have a majority of the public opinion of online art communities in the palms of their fishy hands.
