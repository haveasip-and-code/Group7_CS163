A 'retired' [DDR] player. Was considered to be the best player in the US (or World) for the majority of his 'career'. Started playing when the game became popular, and started winning tournaments around 2002. After winning a few multi-thousand dollar prizes his appearances became less and less frequent and less and less stellar. Never seemed enthusiastic about the scene and frequently stated he was interested only in the money. While he never made any 'official' retirement statement his reason for quiting was likely disinterest, since he still allegedly was able to achieve record-breaking scores on similar games such as [ITG] months after his last tournament win.
