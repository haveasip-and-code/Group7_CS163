shitty pants
One who defecates in their own pants. Forever labeled 'Shitty Pants'. A label in which few are given. This label is not one that is generally liked by the wearer. Because people know just from the name, there is a slight chance you may, infact shit your pants while in their company. And once people think this, there is no real way for anyone to feel comforatable in your presence. Perhaps after time the label will loose its weight, but the half-life of this label rivals that of Uranium 235.
