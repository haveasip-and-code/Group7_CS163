AKA. [Oral], [Rectal], and [Vaginal] Pear. ; A [torture] device shaped like a pear; had four segments which opened and closed at the turn of a screw at the top, like a flower opening its petals. ; This torture gadget was inserted into the mouths or [heretic]s, [blasphemer]s, disturbers of the peace... ; Or into the [rectum]s of people convicted of [sodomy]. [Homosexual] men were especially [vulnerable] to this... ; Or into the [vagina]s of women convicted of [adultery] or 'sexual realtionships with [Satan]'. ; Often, the ends of the pear's segments were fitted with sharp [tine]s, designed to rip into the throat, intestines, or cervix. ; What ever cavity that the pear entered would face a range of things, from a slight expansion of the pear's segments and discomfort for the victim, up to total expansion and unrepairable (and very painful) mutilation of the cavity.
