bombadil
Mysterious character from J.R.R Tokiens The Lord of the Rings. His ancestry, creation, or relation to the other races of Middle earth have never been definitely proven. Tokien said in various letters that he left bombadil as a mystery and purposefully left little info on him. Tom Bombadil in Lotr appears to be all powerful and perhaps imortal. It has been theorized that Bombadil may be a Maia, the Vala Alue, one of the various spirits who entered middle earth with the valor, or even the god of middle earth Iluvatar.
