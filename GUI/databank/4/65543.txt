automatic
A transmission commonly known as a 'slushbox'. One of the most pointless creations that man has ever conceived. Automatic transmissions essentially limit the amount of control one has over the engine, decrease awareness of driving, and shift like concrete in a blender. But slower. Automatic drivers can be spotted either with both hands on the wheel or both hands on the kids at all times. Or asleep. Americans have unfortunately become dependent on automatic transmissions. This is half the reason why they suck at driving. Jesus would drive a manual.
