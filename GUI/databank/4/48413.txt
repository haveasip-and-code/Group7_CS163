Star Wars
Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Iniative, a planned system during the cold war to prevent a nuclear attack on the United States. The system would have the ability to destroy a missle in the air before it hits Earth. That may sound good, but this program is a huge waste of money, especially after the cold war is over. Clinton made a choice to stop the system, but unfortunately Bush decided that it was necessary to make a few thousand Americans starve at the expense of a useless missle system that would be made even more useless if Bush stayed out of Iraq and ended the 'war on terror' (aka War for Oil.)
