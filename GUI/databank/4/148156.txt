Explosions Moment
A moment when listening to Explosions in the Sky where everything for those few minutes is perfect and nothing else matters. Only that room and that moment is what it is important, not the past nor the future. ; One does not realize an Explosions Moment is taking place while it is occuring. They will only come to see that it took place after it has finished happening. ; Most explosions moments take place when one is high or intoxicated or about to become high or intoxicated. Explosions moments work best when one is high for it is most likely to occur at that time. This is because everyone is all riled up when they are high, and they will come to this moment where everything settles down, and if Explosions in the Sky happens to be playing then ; BAM! ; You've got an Explosions Moment.
