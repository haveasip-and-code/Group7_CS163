barrister
A pretentious-sounding, but meaningless word that illiterate [ijit]s, who want you to think they are from some African nation, impress themselves by claiming that's what they are. ; The word barrister becomes meaningless when used by people writing emails from email domains from anywhere except Nigeria, but claiming to be from Nigeria.
