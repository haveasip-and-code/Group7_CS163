Motorola v300
The worst cell phone ever made. ; People are attracted to this phone because it's 'fancy.' It has speaker phone, voice dialing and a deacent camera. ; However, it is overpriced, to say the least. Features include: horrible reception, frequent dropped calls, and poor audio quality. Also, it has to be shut off every few days or it will 'lock up' and the battery will have to be removed.
