Paris
One the best Cities in the world !! Capital of France and art and culture. Some ignorants often insult Parisians of being rude, but it's generally because : ; 1) If you go to NYC and you speak French to ppl, they won't understand and will get angry because you make no effort to speak their language : the same goes with the french... ; 2) People who go to work aren't too happy to be asked twice a day where is the Eiffel Tower... ; And, against all the prejudices, people in Paris *do* take showers everyday (France is well known for products as L'oreal...), and are cool persons....
