Triangulism
Triangulism is the belief that the ultimate omnipotent force is the Triangle. The Triangle consists of three components. Crayon, a physical manifestation of piety. Maths, the logistics in which substantial mathmatical evidence supports the thesis of the Triangles strength. Cool-air, the benevolent forces of forgiveness and comfort. ; Triangulism rejects and denounces the notions of [Circularism], which proposes the strength of the circle over the Triangle. Triangular scriptures say that the Circle was once a square. But, tired of subversion, the square rounded it's edges and corners and proposed an opposing kingdom to the Triangle. ; Mathmatical evidence suggests that the Triangle is the strongest polygon, and no other polygon can exist without two or more triangles. Humans are viewed as Cones, both triangular and circular. Because of this, the Triangle is understanding of human frailties and imperfections and therefore doesn't condemn humanity. However, those who willingly take the side of the circle are condemned to the circular kingdom.
