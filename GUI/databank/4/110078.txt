emo poseur
'I think I'm emo...I mean, I dress like it, my hair looks like it (which I, like, totally didn't mean it to...) and I like the music.' Believe it or not, someone actually said this to me. I don't pretend to know every detail of the 'emo' culture, but I'm at least smart enough to know that listening to Dashboard Confessional because the new guy 'that's sooo hot cause I saw his picture with his mom on myspace' likes it, chopping off 3/4 of your hair (but leaving the long bangs, of course), going on a steady diet of Prozac, and using an exacto knife to carve the word 'die' into your leg (no joke, saw it with my own eyes...) does not define 'emo'. And after explaining all this to her, I get the response, 'No but I really think I am though.'
