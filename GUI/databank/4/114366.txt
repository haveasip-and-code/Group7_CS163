Explosions in the Sky
Explosions in the Sky is a four-man post-rock band out of Austin, Texas. They've released two full length albums which I highly recommend. Only 300 CD's were made for their first CD but they do plan on rereleasing it in the not too distant future. ; As of now they're working on a Travels in Costants EP.
