forum
A place on the internet within a site in which people can discuss topics with other people. A Forum is separted by topic sections and those are divided by sections called 'threads' (You are the one who creates the thread, and see how many people respond to you, or view your opinion). Forums are operated by moderators. Forum moderators are usually offended by the smallest imperfections (they are usually power freaks). In many Forums, you are not allowed to swear or insult people, displaying pictures of naked people or gory/bloody incidents.
