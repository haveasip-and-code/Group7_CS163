butterzone
When a computer goes faster and faster until it's thought processes become a loop and in the infinite moment before it crashes it becomes self aware, that, my friend, is the butterzone. When Keanu comes back to life in the first Matrix movie, and everything slows down and the bullets stop, that is the butterzone.
