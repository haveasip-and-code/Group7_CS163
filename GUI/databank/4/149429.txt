manblink
Men tend to try not to cry. In doing so they come up with different mechanisms to hide their emotions. None is more obvious than the manblink (or man-blink). The manblink consists of wide-eyed blinking by a man when trying not to let tears slip from his eyes. The thought process being that by blinking heavily and often, the tears will be reabsorbed.
