kevin smith
He's one of the best writer/director/producers in recent history with Scott Mosier. These two have pumped out several great movies. This is a very simple premise. Kevin Smith makes good movies. He is creative, he writes snappy dialog, and he is funny. From Clerks to Mallrats, from Chasing Amy to Dogma and back again to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back --- his movies are very solid. He's also known as Silent Bob.
