VDS
VDS is an acronym for Violent Dink Shaking. Violent [Dink] shaking has long been thought to occur only in West Polynesia, however, this is not true. Dink shaking has long been a tradition of the Dink tribe which can be traced back to the late to mid 600s BC, also known as the 'Dink Age.' At first the tribe only practiced Dink shaking but after time it evolved into a violent act and has been ever since. ; The exact date of this transition has not yet been discovered but it is widely believed that it was sometime around 1989-1990. It was at this time that the four Dinks were born. For more on the four Dinks and their identity please look up [dink] and find the definition about 4 people submitted by club4.
