sprm
First discovered in Scotland by the reknowned Sir J. Hubert Cunninglus of Jizmshire Castle, 'sprm' was the word uttered by his lordship upon his ejaculation of the Ooze which brought forth his many happy children. From that day hence, it has been in the vocabulary of every fresh newborn Scottsman until the day he dies, as Sprm has given Jizmshire Castle its identity ; The Spew of the holiest Orifice manifested upon by the Sluts of Castle Greyskull, Skeletor and Beastman.
