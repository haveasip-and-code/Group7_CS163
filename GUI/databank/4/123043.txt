MATRIX
A facking awesome paintball marker. The most popular matrix as of yet is the Dye Matrix, which evolved in 2004 as the DM4 or Dye Matrix 4(duh). It has continued as the DM5 and DMC, which are some of the most advanced paintball markers on the market. A Matrix is referred to as a 'Trix on occasion.
