providence college
A very small, very white, very catholic college in the ghettos of [providence]. 95% of students are carbon-copies of one another, not that that's a bad thing. they are generally attractive, white, upper middle class, moderately intelligent, with a super-human capacity for alcohol. fake ids are used more than school ids, and every day of the week has its designated drinking locale. oh, and also, there's a pretty decent basketball team.
