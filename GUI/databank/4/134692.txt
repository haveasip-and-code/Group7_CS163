AB/DL
(Acronym for 'Adult Babies/Diaper Lovers'): Sexual fetish in which adult males dress up like babies, including the wearing of adult-sized diapers, and have females mother them as if they were a helpless infant. The male will often soil the diaper and have the female change it to heighten the effect.
