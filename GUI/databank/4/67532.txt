Sailor moon
An anime that was cancelled on cartoon network because it was expected to be bad, having few commercials. Hamtaro wasn't getting enough fans, so they cancelled sailor moon. Hamtaro is where they put all the commercials meanwhile, only one commercial break for sailor moon. Thinking only of money, Serena went bye bye.
