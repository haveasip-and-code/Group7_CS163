SEGA Saturn
[SEGA] 32 bit system. It was made to compete with [Sony]'s [Playstation] and the [Nintendo 64]. ; SEGA originally designed the Saturn for 2D games and were like 'Oh shit' when they saw the playstation. The saturn's controller was very similar to the [PSX]'s, (Playstation) except it had 6 buttons in the normal position and 2 shoulder buttons, as the PSX had the SNES 4 button layout with 4 shoulder pads. The saturn's controller was a 6 button [SEGA megadrive] ([SEGA Genesis]) controller with shoulder buttons. ; The controller was evolutionary of the Megadrive's offering, just like the console was meant to be. The saturn could do a better job of 2D then the PSX and 64, but 3D wasn't as good. With the help of an expansion the saturn could even run some 2D fighters better then the [SEGA Dreamcast] could. Still, games like Daytona USA are Playstation quality. ; The console sold less then 10 million units world wide, mainly due to alot of the good games weren't realeased outside of Japan, and it wasn't as 3D efficent as it's opponents. ; The console had decent sales in Japan, less the the PSX's but the Saturn sold more games: The saturn was more liked by people dedicated to gaming. ; Also it had a battery for save files, there was a memory card but it was expensive. ; Some of the Most popular Saturn games are: NiGHTS into Dreams, Panzer Dragoon series, Dragon force, Guardian heroes, Daytona USA, SEGA rally championship, Virtua Fighter, Fighting Vipers, Fighters Megamix, Radiant Silvergun and more...
