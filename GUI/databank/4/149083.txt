Milton Academy
A prep school in Massachusetts which, although academically excellent, has suffered enormous bad press because of the actions of a few. The student body is incredibly intelligent and independent (albeit not very unified). ; It has its share of normal teenage hormonal behavior, but, contrary to some news reports, is not home to extravagant orgies. Even the stereotypical stoners and shallow [DSG]s tend to be surprisingly intelligent. The administration occasionally feeds the students feel-good, politically correct crap. Boarders are very loyal to their dorms, and day students rally under the 'because our parents love us' slogan... such is life.
