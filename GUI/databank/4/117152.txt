Mosrite
A brand of guitars back in the '50s and '60s. Currently, reproductions are made by Fillmore-Mosrite of Japan. Could be considered the Rolls-Royce of guitars. Played by the Ventures (early '60s surf-rock), Jimi Hendrix, The Ramones, and also by Fred 'Sonic' Smith and Kurt Cobian occasionally.
