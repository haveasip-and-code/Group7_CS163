Alex Jones
A real patriot. To many he seems to be a conspiracy nut hell-bent on fear-mongering and a preacher to the conspiracy choir. Especially if you've never heard him before and catch him in rant mode. ; What many people fail to realize is that he hopes he is wrong about everything he exposes. ; The problem is, he isn't most of the time. If he is, then he's only trying to shed light on a potentially dangerous scheme that could take place. Keeping a peeled eye on all the shenanigans of the apparent new world order and going over it with a fine tooth comb...inevitably he will come across some false alarms. ; He appears to have quite a charisma when he is explaining the evil deeds of the elite that control the world. This can be intimidating to many people and I will admit I was turned off by it, but it is a real quality he has. He speaks with passion for a real mission everyone should start considering. ; He tends to cater to theism quite a lot but this flaw that many atheists or others not into god is heavily overweighed by his extreme intelligence, forsight and passion to try to wake people up and show that the true patriots are the ones who care about the well-being of the country regardless if it is unpopular, not the flag-waving brownshirts that believe everything they see on the TV. ; A real intrigue to his method is that he is not on a particular political party like one would assume...like most likely some fringe conservative or some raging liberal. He exposes both for being the false choices we are given so we think we are free when we are not when regardless of who is in office we're screwed either way.
