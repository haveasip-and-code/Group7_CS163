klaha
A no-talent hack who replaced Gackt as lead singer of the Japanese band Malice Mizer once Gackt went solo. Unfortunately and largely due to teh fact that Klaha could not sing without computers to enhance his voice (he used to be a backround singer who was occasionally used by the band) and also due to the fact that in comparison to Gackt, the former singer, Klaha was a toad in the looks department (a bad thing, considering a lot of their audience were horny fangirls) the band has broken up.
