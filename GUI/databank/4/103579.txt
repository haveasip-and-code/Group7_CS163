realplayer
A popular, free media player for the computer. Made by Version 10 is their newest I believe and it works fine. ; I actually find it to load songs in about 4 or 5 seconds (I didn't think that's much time at all), spam and upgrade suggestions are rare, and I can't even think of a time that I've gotten a pop-up. Some files do seem to play better than others, but it doesn't seem to be anything significant usually. Anyway, I listen to music pretty much on an hourly basis and half of the time, it's from audio saved in my realplayer.
