Nav
A black piece of walking s***, Nav is considered to be extremely dangerous by the authorities and can cause extended amounts of damage when it exposes its defected and retarded 'tits'. Scientists that have studied this revolting creature have all died from laying eyes upon its bare body. Therefore, it is speculated that looking at this creature's body can cause unbelievable amounts of pain, mental scarring, brain damage, and permanent blindness. It can, in serious cases where a person stares at it for more than 2 seconds, trigger a brain cell dysfunction, therefore landing the person into a coma. This was the case for all scientists except one. The unfortunate scientist, named Ananden, was doing a night shift, and happened to be alone in the lab. The creature felt needy, and, seeing Ananden as the only person available, it raped Ananden. Ananden had to have the remains of his ingrown penis amputated. Next day, the creature escaped from the lab, hunted down Ananden, and raped him one last time, this time having it anally, before running off into the wild. We don't want to know the rest. Children, please be careful, I'm begging you.
