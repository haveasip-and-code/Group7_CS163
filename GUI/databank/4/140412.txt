Late Registration
Kanye West's follow-up to [The College Dropout] includes tracks such as 'Diamonds (From the Sierra Leone)' as well as 'Gold Digger' Feat. Jamie Foxx and many other great tracks. This album is surprisingly largely produced by [Jon Brion]. Late Registration released on August 30th 2005 is an instant classic like the last Kanye album.
