Anti-Emo Goths
Those dark, evil, vengeful teens who call themselves goths and whatnot. They tend to attack what they call 'emo-goers' and 'emo-teens.' They wear the typical goth clothing and carry weapons at all times. Many have a fair arsenal at home that they keep in cas of an 'Emo-attack.' Sometimes they will provoke and taunt 'emo-teens,' then attack them. All in all, they aren't nice people when crossed by an Emo-teen.
