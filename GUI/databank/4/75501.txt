Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing
By far the best game in the universe. GameSpot, G4TV, and everyone else who says it sucks are LYING. ; It's got brake slammin', CB talkin' action, 1000s of miles of highways and byways across America, and best of all, this game lets you win every time. YOU'RE WINNER! But watch out for the Ultimate Traffic Stopper: A Police Roadblock!
