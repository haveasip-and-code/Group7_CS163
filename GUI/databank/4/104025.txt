atlantis
An ancient continent that [Plato] said had disappeared beneath the waves 9,000 years before his time (and at least 10,000 or 11,000 years before our time)... the beautiful land, synonmous with [Eden], was a place where all lived in peace and harmony. ; Often discarded as myth, Atlantis is all over, as the people fled the demise of their home and took their customs with them. ; There is a great deal of evidence that Atlantis existed in the area of [Indonesia] (remember, the Americas were not known of until [Columbus], so the Greeks concidered the whole ocean stretching from the coast of [Europe] to the coast of [Asia] to be the [Atlantic] Ocean.)
