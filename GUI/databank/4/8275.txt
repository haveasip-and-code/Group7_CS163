redshirt
A redshirt is one of the basic crew members in the original Star Trek series. In [Aridor] Slave Rescue, every player starts with a redshirt and can use this character to win other characters. Redshirt is a very low-scoring character in all three attributes. ; The term is also used as a verb. To redshirt someone in the Aridor game is to reduce them to only having a redshirt by stealing (or otherwise removing) all their other slaves. Some players redshirt other players who annoy them, and the term is also used for other situations (e.g. where slaves are taken so they can be retaken to make money, and where someone loses all their slaves through attrition over time) where someone is left with only a redshirt.
