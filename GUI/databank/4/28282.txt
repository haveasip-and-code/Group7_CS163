take out the ladder
In the sims2 game, if the player has installed a swimming pool after which the player removes the ladder but leaves the diving board, the sim will jump in the pool and not be able to get out, subsequently their energy will zero out and they will die. Synonomous with setting someone up to remove themselves instead of doing the wetwork and unnecessarily exposing themselves to prosecution.
