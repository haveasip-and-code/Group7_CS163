no-shit guy
A formidable man who says what he means, expects others to do the same and is disinclined to tolerate discourteous behavior from others. ; The term first entered the popular lexicon following the release of the film 'Cadillac Man'. In the film, the character of Larry (played by Tim Robbins) is holding a group of people hostage. He releases some of the hostages, but instructs them to tell the police that 'I'm a no-shit guy.' The hostages then run from the building one by one, screaming 'He's a no-shit guy!'
