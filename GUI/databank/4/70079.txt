pakapaka
Pakapaka is widely recognized as meaning etcetera, etcetera or '..and so on'. The origin of the word Pakapaka is not known although linguists believe the word was first introduced during the late 19th century by indian tribes located in the South American rain forests (probably Brazil). The current English usage of the word Pakapaka is 'Bla-Bla-Bla' however North Americans prefer to use Yada-Yada-Yada. This recent cultural transformation of the word began in the late 20th century and was influenced mainly by leading anthropogists such as Jerry Seinfeld and Cosmo Kramer. The word PakaPaka is also known to be widely used in the Middle East particularly Israel where it is used as a derogatory term meaining 'you are full of shit'.
