John Paul Jones
Bassist from legendary rock band Led Zeppelin. His real name was John Baldwin, but chose the stage name after a freind suggested it to him after reading it on a french movie poster. Played Bass, keyboards, piano, organ, and mandolin for Led Zeppelin. His solo career was good, and on his solo albums he plays almost every instrument. A great musician, and often overlooked. Also the name of some navy guy.
