Old Bridge High School
An overcrowded gathering of students due to inaccurate gauging of districts, wherein what was once known as a minority of brown and asian people somehow outnumber the caucasian population. Once noted as the 'next Columbine' by Howard Stern, in accordance to the early bomb threats and gas leak scare of school year 2004/2005. Up until the class of 2005 graduated, it was one of the only schools to have two campuses that are two miles apart. The upper-middle class kids all think they're ghetto. Cliques form, but OBHS kids cant relate with the classic groupy classification of high school that you see in the movies. We have groups of all sorts and we hate everyone almost equally. There's still the asians that play DDR, the goth kids that play hackey sack, and the preppy girls that worry about nothing but their appearance, but somehow we manage to get along and tear each other apart at the same time. It's a place of love/hate relationships with everything you come across and a place that you dream of getting out of but never forget once its all over. One of the strangest schools you'll ever stumble into.
