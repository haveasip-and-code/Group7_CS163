University of Wisconsin Madison
Unlike the above definition, the University of Wisconsin Madison is a prestigious university where education is everything but so is having a good time. You will find the most school spirit in Madison than anywhere else in Wisconsin. We are the number one party school but do not 'fuck around' or 'fuck-off'. Time management is a must-have skill here (obviously if we go out everynight but still get up and get an A on an exam the next morning).
