dogma
1) A doctrine or a corpus of doctrines relating to matters such as morality and faith, set forth in an authoritative manner by a church. ; 2) An authoritative principle, belief, or statement of ideas or opinion, especially one considered to be absolutely true. See Synonyms at [doctrine]. ; 3) A principle or belief or a group of them. ; Usage: -- [Dogma], [Tenet]. A tenet is that which is maintained as true with great firmness; as, the tenets of our holy religion. A dogma is that which is laid down with authority as indubitably true, especially a religious doctrine; as, the dogmas of the church. A tenet rests on its own intrinsic merits or demerits; a dogma rests on authority regarded as competent to decide and determine. Dogma has in our language acquired, to some extent, a repulsive sense, from its carrying with it the idea of undue authority or assumption. This is more fully the case with its derivatives dogmatical and dogmatism.
