Add-Me Whore
1. Can be found in MySpace and many other websites of the like. They come in all shapes and sizes...whether it's emo, punk, thug, valley girl, etc. They like to post numerous bulletins and threads saying 'add me!' Their main purpose is to get as many friends as possible. It is impossible not to see any of such people on MySpace becuase they run so rampant.
