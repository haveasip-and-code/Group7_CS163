Retrogade
Retrogade is a poor man's [Newgrounds] and is a photoshop based site. Retrogade features odd rules, like the 'No voting in extremes' rule, 'Retroins', the offical currency of Retrogade, and the 'Moderator Elections' ; It features a Message Board much like Newgrounds, and also has a 'Photoshop Portal', which seems to be a play on words from the 'Flash Portal' of Newgrounds. ; Retrogade is pretty much the same thing as Newgrounds, except there's less people, and still pictures.
