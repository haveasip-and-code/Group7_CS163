ponzi scheme
1) A phrase used by idiots for any type of [scam]. ; 2) A specific type of [scam]. The operator (often from [nigeria]) of the scam promises 'investors' that their money will be doubled in a certain number of days. The operator depends on the money provided by later investors to pay off his obligations to the earlier investors. This turns out splendidly for the early investors (assuming that it takes off), but later investors get the [short end of the stick], as no more people are enrolling. At this point, the operator usually takes the money he has left and runs. This generally [sucks] for the later investors. Not that I care, because you have to be a total [dumbass] to enroll in a ponzi scheme anyhow.
