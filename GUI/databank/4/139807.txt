Bellambi
A Suburb of [Wollongong] located right on the beach, over run by druggies, alcoholics and dole bludgers. A casual drive through Bellambi would result in one seeing children running around bare footed, alcohol bottles, remanents of boxes (possibly someone living inside)and approximatley 12 syringes.
