Quandar
Strictly speaking 'Quandar' is an adjective used to describe a feeling, state, emotion, or un-godly sex act arising out of the trials and tribulations of living in a post 9/11 enviornment. As well, 'Quandar' can be used in terms of tough parenting in direct relation to 9/11 and it's aftermath. One should be carefull when interjecting 'Quandar' into casual conversation - being an emotionally charged term - using it lightly can have unforseen repercussions.
