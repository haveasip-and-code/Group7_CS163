Glass Bottomed Boat
This is for poop freaks that might not want to go all the way. Person A (the shitter) and person B (the target a.k.a the person 'shat' upon) Person B lays under a glass top coffee table while looking up. Person A takes a dump over the persons face, or other appropriate area of choice. Thus simulating being 'pooped on' without all the mess. (I belive the smell could still be an issue) ; origin: unknown, though based on glass bottom boats used to watch fish .
