Googaly Goggaly Tennis
Best flippin' game ever created. Only the ultra amazing minds of Joe E and Adam K could have come up with such an amazing game. ; Played with 2 teams of a max of 2 players on each side, on a tennis court. ; Rules: ; 1. No reaching over or going over the other side of the net ; 2. If the ball goes over the fence, you lose ; 3. You lose if the ball completly stops rolling ; 4. Balls that somehow roll under the fence and stop under, or on the other side are played, andn counted as a stop. ; 5. Play EVERYTHING. ; 6. No blacks, jews or Ty's. ; 7. The only exception to the player-per team-rule is if you are playing double court (!!!)
