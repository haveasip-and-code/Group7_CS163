Carebear
One who does nothing but stand around and look, while all other are helping or putting in effort to help with something. ; Often uses his special power, 'carebear stare', erroneously thinking that it has an effect of helping the situation at hand. ; In truth, a carebear often is an irritant to all others in the group/team who are seriously helping out while he tries hard to look as if he is helping and caring. ; A carebear often makes use of the great number of people around him, who are doing work, as a cover for his 'Carebear Stare'/slacking. ; Often happens at Scout/girl-guide Camps where everyone is doing their part to pitch tents while the carebear stands around intensely gazing with his 'Carebear Stare' to look like he is contributing. ; Also occurs in the office (eg. meetings) where the carebear looks on while the group is actively contributing to the project discussion.
