Kratos
The main Character in God of War. Also a mythological character. He was a spartan warrior who when defeated by barbarians pledged his life to the God of War Ares. This granted him power that led to him becoming the avatar for Ares on earth and Kratos is basically a powerhouse until he goes on a killing spree and murders his wife and kids. Kratos realizes this deception and sets out to find Pandora's box to defeat Ares, which results in the most awesome ending of Kratos getting screwed over by the gods of Olympus and then becoming the new God of War.
