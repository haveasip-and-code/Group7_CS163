Metro
Common name for the underground mass transit system (subway) in both Montreal, QC and Paris, France. In Montreal the Metro runs exclusively underground on a dedicated electrified third rail right-of-way, with many of the stations having bus terminals. Run under the banner of the STCUM (Societe de Transports du la Communite Urbaine de Montreal--in french) Heavy rail passenger service is handled by a separate agency called AMT (Agence Metropolitain de Transports), and requires a separate zone-base fare system, rather than the transfer you get from the bus.
