Jerry Garcia

Throughout his career, he led the Dead through numerous changes, becoming one of the most famous figures in the history of modern rock and folk. Jerry pursued many side projects, ranging from the bluegrass group Old & in the Way to his folky solo recordings. Garcia stayed active as a member of the Grateful Dead and as a solo performer until his death in 1995. ; A music 'god' to many of his [hippie] followers from the 60's-until his death is 1995. A father to many, 'Jerry's kid' was a popular bumper sticker during the [Grateful Dead] years. We lament the death of our beloved Jerry, and we continue to remember him and see the rest of his band, The Dead, tour and put on some great shows. Thingswont be the same, but we gotta keep on truckin'
