Puta Dorada
Spanish: translates directly to english as 'golden whore'. ; The nickname of a blonde spanish noble-lady during the napoleonic wars, who slept with the french officers in order to attain information for the english army. ; used by me to describe 'tubby' (a mate of mine. Don't worry, i'm not trying to be mean, that really is his nickname. tubby, i mean), who is blonde and a homophobic, so calling him a manwhore has great effect, insult-wise.
