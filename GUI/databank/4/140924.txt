Social Distortion
One of the few surviving [punk] bands out of [OC] in California. Came out in 1978 with Mike Ness, Casey Royer, Rikk and Frank Agnew. Through many changes in the lineup SD pushed the spirit of true punk through rough times. ; Mainly sing about problems of bad luck, run down, drug abused life, seeing as thats how it was for Ness. Best Songs were mommys little monster, Ball and chain, story of my life, Dont drag me down and few others. They have refused to change their style of music, thus making them one of the best punk bands ever. ; The line up now is Ness, Charlie Quintana, Jonny '2 Bags' Wickersham, and Matt Freeman of [Rancid]. ; RIP Dennis Danell.
