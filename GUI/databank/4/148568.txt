eatons neck
a small peninsula off of northport. connects to northport by asharoken road which is patrold by the world famous nazi asharoken police dept. (word of advice if your driving on asharoken and go over 32mph there pulling you over).Eaton's neck is a good little town it is upper middle class unfortinaly becoming infested with yuppies. It is home to the Eatons neck FD who managed to burn down there own fire house but overall a good group.eatons neck does have a club called the POENB (property owners of eatons neck beach) they do nothing. you just get a cool sticker every year.In conclusion eatons neck is a great place for all kinds of thing especially some late night drinking etc. so come visit
