puking dinosaur
Puking dinosaur is an improvisational theater game in which a group of people stand in a circle and one person starts a physical action with a vocal sound. This person does this action to another person, walking to them in the process, and then the next person does their best impresion of the action-sound, but hieghtening it, raising the intesity, and taking it to the next level. This causes a natural and organic change or mutation in the action-sound. This is repeated for each person until the action-sound combonation resembles somthing like a puking dinosaur. An alternate version in everyone does the action-sound to the person on their left and it goes around in a circle. This second version of puking dinosaur mutates much faster.
