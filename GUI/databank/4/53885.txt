headbanger's ball
A metal show on MTV2. The show is pretty formuliac: Shadows Fall video, Unearth video, 9 minutes of commercials, 8 more minutes of atreyu/avenged sevenfold. 9 more minutes of commercials, shitty videos interrupted by Jamey jatsa (who deserves to die, considering Hatebreed is so shitty), an eighteen visions video, then more commercials, then another unearth video, etc. Sometimes they actually show good videos, but its usually those shitty watered down metalcore bands. I usually get tired before a good video comes on and i change it. Jamey Jasta needs to be kicked the fuck off the show or learn to shut up
