Echelon 2000
The Echelon 2000 was designed by AG to keep a constant flow of 'Sexy text' (See Definition) to females of AG's choice. The system is automated and utilises AG's mobile phone address book to constantly 'poll' a list of phone numbers with sms messages. The system is set-up to favour AG's friends sisters and has the ability to 'hack' their mobiles if extra information about them is needed.
