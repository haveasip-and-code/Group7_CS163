chorley
Town in central Lancashire, in the United Kingdom. The town proclaims itself to be 'Lancashire's Biggest Little Market Town.'

However, there have been temporary licenses in the area broadcasting under the name following the programme's success. ; Chorley is also famous for its Chorley Cakes, far superior to the nearby Eccles cakes.
