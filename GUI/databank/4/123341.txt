Rock N Roll
1)A term used to describe an overhyped fad. 2)A word used to describe an exhausted genre. 3)A phrase used to describe the end result of poor musicians, who are even worse lyricists, composing a horrendously sounding 1 to 2.5 minute song that is hailed by the bourgeoisie, not because of any inherent greatness in compostion or artistic value, but because it provides catharsis in a boring materialistic non-spiritual society. Most 'great' rock ideas have been stolen from blues, gospel, and jazz artists who labored with genuine passion to produce something complex, original, and timeless.
