high
To 'get high' off of something means to feel especially good after doing something. That something might be algebra, some kind of drug, or perhaps a really good book. The high off of illegal drugs, though, is synthetic and is NOT a good high, as it brings your mood straight down after you get this high. ; You might laugh at the slightest thing or feel free of worry. It depends on the individual, really.
