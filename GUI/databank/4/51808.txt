Chap Slap
When a male moves rapidly i.e. jogs, runs, or gallops at a fast rate and their testicles and/or penis hits their inner thigh area (unilaterally or bilaterally, depending on which way you lean and how fast you're moving) creating a 'SLAP' noise that can be heard by others. ; Cause: ; Commonly by not wearing any supporting undergarments (i.e. underpants) which allows the gonads to move free-flowingly. ; Action: ; Wear underpants or some other type of supporting undergarment (stupid) ; WARNING!! Can be painful! ; N.B. Through recent study it has been noted that women can also suffer from a female equivalent of 'chap slap'. ; However, more studies have to be conducted in order to confirm the origins of the 'SLAP' noise. ; Scientists are unsure whether it originates from the genitals, buttocks thighs or overtly large and gravitationally affected mammary tissue(s). ; Biologically female candidates will be required for a forthcoming study - Sadly, due to poor sponsorship, candidates will not be rewarded for their efforts.
