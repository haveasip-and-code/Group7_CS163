Generic Boyfriend
The scourge of all other men. These are usually guys who have that designer stubble and floppy haircut. For whatever reason, these guys always seem to have beaten you to the girl you're after by about 3 years. Since a lot of these guys are based on the same template, the term Generic Boyfriend is most suitable. ; See also [Metrosexual] and [Brad Pitt]
