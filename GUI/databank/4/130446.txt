the wave off
The motion made when an individual draws back their arm and waves it towards someone with a flick of the wrist and typically an 'ahhhh'. A direct relative to the [fist shake]. This is performed when the individual has had enough of conversation. Can be performed by all age groups, however a senior discount card is a bonafied license to wave off
