There you are!
This is what people in the UK used to say before the arrival of the ubiquitous 'There you go!' from the US. It is what is said by a cashier at the checkout when they return your credit card, by the waiter when they bring a you a meal, etc etc. It doesn't really mean much, it's an acknowledgement more than anything. Sometimes 'Here you are!' is substituted for 'There you are!'.
