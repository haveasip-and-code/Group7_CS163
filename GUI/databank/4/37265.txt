best friend
if you're a girl, then it's a person that you can call 'b!tch' or a person that you normally call 'b!tch.' It is a person that you are so close to that when you guys insult each other, you guys take it as a sign of love. You guys have no problem saying, 'luv ya,' or hugging. You guys call each other just to say hi, and you guys laugh at everything. You guys are major losers and dorks and you guys like it that way. You guys got major inside jokes, & can be completely honest with each other no matter what, and never hate on each other. You'll always be best friends and you think that everyone should envy that you have such a friend as <i>her</i>... BFF
