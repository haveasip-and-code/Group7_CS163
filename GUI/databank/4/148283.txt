Awkward. Porn. (and) Music. Encounter. ; when one person is watching porn and the other is listening to music and a parent comes down to check out whats going on. The person listening to music hears the parent but because of the loud music ends up screaming 'CHANGE THE CHANELL' instead of the recomended whisper. The parent is usually a little confused but decides its better to not question what happened.
