When someone takes your backpack, removes the contents, flips the backpack inside out, and puts back in the contents. Afterwards the backpack is often stapled shut along the zipper. Other ways to keep it shut is to put a paperclip between the zippers on the inside. In the most extreme cases, the backpack is buried underground or sealed in a metal box.
