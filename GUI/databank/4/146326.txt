buddy jesus
1. Originally from the Kevin Smith movie 'Dogma'. In the film, Cardinal Glick, during his 'Catholicism WOW!' campaign to move the church towards a younger, 'hipper' demographic, suggest replacing the crucifix with a new image of Christ. This version is grinning like an infomercial host, with one hand thumbs up and one hand doing a phony Hollywood 'Bang-bang' gesture. Imagine Jesus if he were subject to Neilsen ratings. ; 2. Anyone who possesses all the false charm and lack of genuine quality as personified by the icon represented in definition 1; for example, that phony cockbite where you work. It helps if they walk around all the time acting like only THEY can save you/the corporation/Earth/Jimmy Olsen. Martyrdom: It's a good gig if you can get it.
