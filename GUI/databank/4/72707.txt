Ed
A great show about a lawyer who moves back into his hometown and runs his law firm in a bowling alley that he bought. While back in town, he decides to approach his old high school crush. This show was completely original and had a great plot in every episode. It was one hilarious show with quarky characters and of course, awesome Tom Cavanagh as Ed Stevens in the show. The show got cancelled after 4 great seasons. I'll never forget this brilliant show. You can watch reruns on TBS at noons (as of right now).
