jew seat
The shittiest seat at The Table. Only the Jew sits there. The only problem is that The Table has no jew. Therefor anyone who sits in the Jew seat is treated like a Jew until the end of lunch. ; NOTE: This is not anti-semitism! I got nuttin against Jews. It's just history. If u dont know what i be talkin bout u need to pay attention when the teacher is teaching bout the Holocaust.
