Jewpanese
n. The rare combination of New York Jew and Japanese. With many Jewpanese there is a little Philipino mixed in as well, considering the fact that there are large populations of Jews and Philipinos in New York City. In any case, the Jewpanese person is hard to pick out of a crowd, and rarely seen.
