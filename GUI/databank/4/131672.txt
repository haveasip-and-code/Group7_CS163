CBP
Citizens Border Patrol. ; This movement was started by some concerned citizens living in Sout Western Texas. The group patrols the Mexican/Texan border. The government does not support the group but they have no problem with them. CBP places Illegal Mexican Immigrants under Citizens arrest and provide them with food, water and medical care before handing them over to the local Police Department.
