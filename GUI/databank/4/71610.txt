Palm
1) The 'inside' of the hand (when a fist is made). Food is usually held in/balanced on the palm. ; 2) To hold a basketball (or something else, maybe; I've only heard it used when talking about basketball) with only the palm. Useful when dunking. ; 3) Tropical tree. Its leaves are known as 'fronds'.
