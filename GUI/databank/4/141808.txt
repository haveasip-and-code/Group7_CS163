The Visitors
Known as [Les Visiteurs] in France. A kickass movie starring [Jean Reno] about an 11th century knight and his squire who are accidentally transported to modern times by a senile wizard. The plot centers around the nobleman's quest to return back to his own time by enlisting the help of his descendant. A cult classic in France. Its image has since been tarnished by 'Les Visiteurs 2' and the American version 'Just Visiting.'
