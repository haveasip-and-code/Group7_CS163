nose nugget
A nose nugget is one of those wonderful little green suprizes that you discover fluttering in your nostril. Sometimes they are hard and crunchy, and sometimes they are soft and mushy. Not to be confused with snot, which is of a more liquid consistency and can be stretched out to 100 times its original length. Nose nuggets are very handy for picking and flicking into someones hair that you dont like. Or to wipe in an unsuspecting place for someone else to discover. What a thoughtful suprize. Now go out there and share your nose nuggets with everyone.
