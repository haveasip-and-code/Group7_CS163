Bar Room Betty
A description based after the now-famous Bar Room Betty of Ocean Beach, NY, who was sinisterly kidnapped, bukaked ([bukake]), degraded, and dismembered. Mostly used as a derogatory term for someone who deserves no respect, or who is wished the same unfortunate tragedy that overcame the namesake of the word.
