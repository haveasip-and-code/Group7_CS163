field hockey fanatic
crazed male [field hockey] fan; A fanatic will yell at the referees, later to be noted as 'rude', but not knowing any rules. A group of fanatics is usually led by a wicked sexist guy, who wears field hockey jackets and says referees 'havent heard shit yet', planning to be 'absolutely fuckin' obnoxious. A fanatic shows up at nearly all games, not knowing why, but also screaming at any call they think is against their team.
