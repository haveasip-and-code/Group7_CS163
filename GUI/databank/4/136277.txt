towson town center
a mecca for the preppy rich kids living in the surrounding areas. A mall full of [collar-popping] princes and princesses. Almost all of the people who shop here have entitlement issues - meaning that they feel that they are entitled to everything, and don't give a damn whether or not they knock you over getting to it. Don't try to get service in any of the stores, unless you are wearing some piece of identifiable [Tiffany's] jewelry, or are wearing a rolex. Also, a huge daycare center for teenagers after school lets out for the day.
