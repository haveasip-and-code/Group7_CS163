Consciousism
Consciousism: The philosophy which says that the primary purpose of the existance of any conscious being, whether it be man, beast, machine, robot, or kangaroo, is to enjoy its consciousness for the maximum duration it can, and upon losing its consiousness, or at least physical awareness as it's known to the living or sentient, is to be remembered and thus gain an element of physically unconscious permanence. ; Consciousism also states that consciousness and/or sentience is as real as anything that could possibly exist; it is not a mere illusion, since to perceive an illusion requires consiousness.
