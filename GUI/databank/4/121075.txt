Ghetto Skater
A term used for black skateboarders that listen to rap music and go skateboarding. They do not want to be called just a regular skateboarder because many skateboarders are loud, annoying,light-skinned, and listen to horrible rock music. This name is a symbol of uniqueness and is a nice and useful comeback when a fellow black person disses a black skateboarder.
