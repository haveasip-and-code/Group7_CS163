Air Assault
A highly effective method of deploying Army and Marine Corps combat elements into remote battlefields in a short amount of time, utilizing rotary winged aircraft(helicopters) rather than fixed wing aircraft(airplanes). This gives them the advantage of landing on or completely bypassing terrain features for drop off or pick up of said combat elements making them faster and considerably more mobile than Airborne elements which are forced to rely on the Army Air Corps...I mean Air Force, for insertion.
