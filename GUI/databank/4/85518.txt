nightmare before christmas
Nightmare Before Christmas is a work of art. Came out in 1993 and I have watched it since I was 3 years old. I grew up with the movie, as did many other people I know. Suddenly the 10th anniversary of the film's release in 2003 brings the love for this movie to the public masses, and was every kind of merchandise was sold at [HotTopic]. Now if it was anything else I would have said they sold out, but it was NBC so I didn't read too much into it, thinking the sales of NBC merchandise would just slowly decrease, but ever since then it has probably doubled. Now every little bull shiting emo asshole, and 12year old kid loves fucking NBC. (most of the time the Emo assholes are also 12 year olds, or just look like it.) So yea it should be amusing to witness the slaughter of Tim Burton's newest film [Corpse Bride]...ha, don't make me laugh.
