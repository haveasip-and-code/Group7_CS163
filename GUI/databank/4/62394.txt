The irritating derivation of English for when you are getting charged per letter: The sentence 'Greetings friend, what is it that you intend to do later tonite?' Could be translated into: 'hi m8 wht u doin 2nite'. Frequently used with mobile phones but increasingly online, eg. Instant Messaging. YOU CAN TYPE AS MUCH AS YOU WANT ON MESSENGER!
