Homeroom
The very beginning of the school day at high school. Before first period. The best time to finish quick homework assignments that are due that day. Or to just half-ass any kind of homework you may have. This is for people who would rather spend their [sunday afternoon], or any other day, doing something besides homework. Also, you may be able to copy someone else's homework for your class if you're lucky.
