royalty
Children of a famous popstar, rock musician, movie star, etc. Never used nowadays for real royal families, who are 'monarchy'. Often have strange 'rock royalty' or 'Hollywood royalty' names handed out by drug-crazed parents shortly after the (Caesarian) birth. Usually chronically over-indulged, leading to severely disordered personalities in later life that have to be 'recovered' from.
