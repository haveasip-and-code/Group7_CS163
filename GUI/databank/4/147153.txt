Niantic
A small southeastern Connecticut beach town whose population grows three fold in the summer when all the old people return to their cottages with their attractive young granddaughters. You can pick up nice trinkets related to Niantic at the various Niantic-centric shops...(Niantic people are proud of where they come from).
