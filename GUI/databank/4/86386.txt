stumpbroke
When some bastard in the throes of bestiality trains a horse, mule, or any livestock animal into not walking away from a tree stump whenever he, ahem... 'assumes the postion'... ; if said bastard gets his freak on with said beast of 'burden', and the animal has not tried to run off, it's stumpbroke.
