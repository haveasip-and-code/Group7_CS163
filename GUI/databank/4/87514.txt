Smart parts
Best paintball gun company, known for there impulses and shockers. They also have the nerve and ion. Its not a nazi company because they sue companys,they sue because of people taking their patents. Smartparts had the original patent on vision and companys like eclipse are making eyes now for their guns, if u want to upgrade after ure cocker or impulse, go with a shocker or nerve. You wont be dissapointed. IF u want to get an a-5 DONT get the ion. smartparts has guns for every level of experience. I myself use an 05 shocker and it RIPS. I was recently at a tourny and many people complemented on how well my gun fuctioned
