Fairfield
A place full of rich and white WASPS and some minorities who have more money than the Americans. The kids drive around town in their Audi, BMW, Mercedes or Range Rover wearing their Prada, Gucci, Armani or Polo. ; There are more country clubs then you can count on one hand. The houses cost a ridiculous amount of money (if your house doesn't cost at least $2 million your poor). If you look for a house under $1 million dollar you will find a shack by the garbage dump. ; All the rich dads either work in New York as an executive, own their own business or do some 'finance'. GE's top executives for some reason love to reside in this town. ; If you happen to live on Sasco Hill Road you can declare yourself and/or your neighbors as having the most damn money in all of Fairfield & Westport because your house easily costs 8 figures (One house sold for nearly $25 million). Fairfield doesn't even light a candle to [Greenwich]. Welcome to Fairfield where high schools cost more then your college tuition, 16 year olds drive cars that the rest of America can't afford, families go on vacation all over the damn world and houses routinely sell in the 8 figure territory.
