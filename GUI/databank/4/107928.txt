AOL User
Derogatory term for someone either incapable of performing a simple action or requiring excessive guidance to perform such a task. ; This is generally a worse insult than [Newbie] or it's derivatives as Newbies are expected to gain experience and improve whilst AOL Users are expected to stay stupid. ; Stupid people are not required to actually use America Online to qualify as an AOL User.
