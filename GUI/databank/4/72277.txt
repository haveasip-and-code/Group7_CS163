stereophonics
Stereophonics, an extemely multi-talented group. They seem to put a lot of emotion into their performances. With songs that are hypnotizing and mood altering, like Mr.Writer, to mixing it up with Tom Jones, Mama told me not to come, they show complete diversity. AND YES, A VERY,VERY, SEXY LEAD SINGER!!!
