Teen Hippies
Teenagers that think they care about the world, make banners and signs for school, walk around at lunch with no shoes on, wear long dark colored skirts (girls), play hacky sack (boys), are all vegetarian, annoy all meat eaters on how they are hurting 'poor animals', also like to hang out with the Drama Kids (if they are not already one), lay on the grass during lunch, dance around during lunch and piss off everybody that's not a hippy at lunch.
