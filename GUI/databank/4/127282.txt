too pooped to pop
Too tired to continue what ever is in progress. ; From [pooped], meaning tired, and [pop] meaning ejaculate; literally, too tired to have sex. Frequently used by [fogies] who would be offended if they heard anyone say the literal meaning, because they don't think about what they're saying.
