Virginia Tech
A prestigious university in a college town full of bars providing nightlife. Not to mention the football team that draws Virginians from all over the state. Cavaliers seem to think that it is filled with people who couldn't get into UVA. However, the majority of Hokies never desired to go to UVA in the first place. And VT doesn't take just anybody. So those of you prospective students better make sure you got a good gpa or sat score because VT's public and your money doesn't matter to the admissions office. (unless your parents make a valuable donation of course) Just because you got into Bridgewater does not mean Tech will take you. Private schools take anybody these days. So if you want to be a future Hokie, you better get off your ass and study.
