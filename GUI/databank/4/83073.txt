Shagohod
'The Treading Behemoth' in Russian. The name of a dangerous (and fictional) weapon in the game Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This machine is equipped with a giant turret for the launch of an SS-20 nuclear missile. Normally, iy would not be able to launch the missile more than two or three thousand miles, but with a special Sokolov-designed rocket propulsion system, when it reaches full speed and launches the warhead, the range easily becomes over six thousand miles, allowing it to strike ANYWHERE in the US from ANYWHERE in Russia. The Shagohod is also equipped with a small but powerful laser, a rocket launcher and two heavy machine guns. Destroyed in 1964 by the world's BADDEST soldier, Naked Snake/Big Boss/John Doe.
