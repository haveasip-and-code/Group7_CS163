Duncan Day
Same as [Oprah Day]. A day where you were supposed to hang out with your gf/bf, but instead your or their friends are in the way when u want to be alone. So you are stuck hanging out with other people, when u just wanted to have some time with your gf/bf. So you waste the whole day and do absolutely nothing.
