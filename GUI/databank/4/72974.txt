vanilla midget
Vanilla = Boring ; Midget = Small ; Used by the Legendary Kevin Nash to describe the oompa loompas Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Gurerro, ect. ; Nash knew they would drive the fans away so heroically buried them for the good of the company. ; Sadly the WWE started to push these losers and as a result ratings are in the gutter.
