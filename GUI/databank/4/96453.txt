Cy/Rae Shipper
A Cy/Rae Shipper (or also known as a Cyborg/Raven Shipper)from the show Teen Titans is a pairing that supports the coupling of the metal cyborg Cyborg and the 1/2 demon girl Raven. This pairing is considered as an enemy to the Beast Boy/Raven shippers. see [Beast Boy/Raven Shipper]. Even though this pairing is considered not popular, it makes some sence because these two Titans showed mild 'hints' of a relationship in certin episodes, Ex. 'Car Trouble'.
