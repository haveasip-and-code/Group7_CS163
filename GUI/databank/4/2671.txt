wasp
a poor goal in foos (table football). here, a goal is scored which is unpredictable and thus hard to save. The ball must come off several banks and/or players. alternately, the shot must be highly random, i.e shot with the 5 man rod while the ball is moving, or a drag and twat where the person taking the shot (usually from the 2 man) doesn't look for gaps, rather just smacks the ball and scores.
