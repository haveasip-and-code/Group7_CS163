Mormons
Scary American jesus-freaks that come to my door trying to convert me to their whacky religion. ; They often sport name tags with the title of 'Elder', despite being of college student age. ; Although they do seem friendly enough, to normal folk they are still god-damned annoying. Indeed, if anybody can put up with a Mormon visit without telling them to '[Fuck Off]', they deserve a VIP place in Heaven.
