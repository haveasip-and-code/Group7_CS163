medford nj
Lived here my whole freaking life. 99.7% white and rich, with badass kids and cars at Shawnee High School. Defentially the most roudiest town you will ever party at. Who's football coaches give them a leeway to party? Ours do! Oh yeah in the school locker room. Two parts, rich and richer. Beach houses for everyone wether its in OC or LBI. Whats the only town where their football team can win 12-0? Medford. What goes down at theese crazy parties? What else, anything you can imagine.
