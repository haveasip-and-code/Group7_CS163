Jville
People use jville to describe a wealthy are also known as phoenix. it is not located in Arizona but in Md. Mothers are stay-at-home soccer moms and drive SUVS. We attend private prep schools and live in huge houses, sometimes way out there. Our favorite hangouts are Strapasta, McDonalds and Papermill Pharmacy. We do not have anywhere to shop so we usually go to Cockeysville. Everything is more expensive and we can afford it.
