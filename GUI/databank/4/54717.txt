CBHS guy
One who will be emplyed by an MUS guy in the future. Always poor unless kicked out of MUS for steriods, other illegal drugs, or for being a fucking moron. Likes to gang up on a future employer in order to quell his inferiority complex. By braving the certainty of a low sperm count and possible death, their athletics are commendable (steroids). However, they are forced every year to watch their rivals across the tracks enjoy their multiple state championships.
