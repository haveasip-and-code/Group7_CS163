mclean bible church
a large church that confuses most of the people who see it. Unknown to most of these people, large churches are ALL OVER the united states, with 20-25 churches this size in Atlanta alone. ; 'Bible church' is not a denomination, and as such mclean bible church answers to no church body on policy but believes in the bible alone as the source of 'church polcy'
