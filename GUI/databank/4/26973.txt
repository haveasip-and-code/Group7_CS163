real job
As opossed to a [shit job] or [McJob]. A real job is a job that pays well, generally involves doing work you enjoy and has at least some level of security because it involves skills that require training enough that helping out an employee that's having difficulty is less expensive then training a new one. ; A real job is one that has the potential for advancement. As well, a certain degree of professional behavior is normally expected of employees and the managment. ; That's in theory that is. ; Unfortunatly, in reality, real jobs are rare in this day and age. With so many trained and skilled people out there, job security doesen't exist in them as they offer little in the way of training and can get new employees from a pool of countless job seekers. As a result, the pay these jobs offer is way down and employees are growing increasingly more often treated as disposable and with little more respect then beasts of burden.
