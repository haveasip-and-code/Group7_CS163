Gatecrasher
Gatecrasher One is a trance club in Sheffield, England that was born after Gatecrasher toured the country, eventually settling at what was called 'The Republic' in Sheffield. Although originally a trance club, it has bowed to the mainstream and now plays cheesey shite on a Thursday that pisses trance fans of the club off a treat. ; Gatecrasher Two, the second of the chain of clubs opening is born in Leeds. ; Often just called 'Crasher.'
