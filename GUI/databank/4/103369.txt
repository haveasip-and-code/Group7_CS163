the drinking game
A game invented by three young boys in the town of [Brookline]. Played in the window bar at Alexanders, usually after early release days. The participants would select their beverage of choice and everytime a car would drive by they would drink, inbetween cars they would have to have their beverage touch the counter before they could drink again. If anyone spit up or spilled at all they would be required to run outside the restaruant and hurl themself into the pole or tree. If a bus drove by the participants would have to chug, the first person to stop or spit up would have to run into the pole or tree.
