Whoopsie Poopsie
In Ancient China, this was said (in Chinese translation of course) during anal sex when ones penis came in contact with the receivers bowel movements. After done with the bowel movement, the anal receiver would then spread the poo on a platter and then rub the platter on the anal giver's nipple (preferably left)
