A gruesome health and sexual act. After a persons back starts to peel from severe sunburn. The person then proceeds to rub faeces into it for sexual pleasure. The heat from the burn solidifys not only the faeces but also sticking up skin which has now become hard and turned a camoflage colour of that a crocodile has.
