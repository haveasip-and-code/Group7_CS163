he is called morgan
A reference to a funny animation from fat-pie.com. Spoken when someone that looks like a creepy stalker/molester is spotted. Characterized by long face, balding and blond, long mysterious coat, glasses, and at least 45 years of age. Hands in pockets are a plus if tallying for points, as are balloons and candy giveaways. Also used as a code phrase if said 'Morgan' is within earshot and you can't say 'That guy is creepy'.
