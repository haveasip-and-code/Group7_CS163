fart
A gaseous emission exerted by the anus. This physical phenomena has baffled man kind for many centuries as some farts are quite repulsive yet others are rather pleasant. Farts can be very deceitful as the silent ones are often the most foul smelling and the loudest are considered comical and do not emit any noticeable odor at all. Farts are most commonly found in a gaseous state but can quite often be in a liquidized form (this is commonly referred to as a wet one). In rare cases people have be known to try and squeeze farts out, this is not recommended as traces of feces may be found in the undergarments later.
