swamp pheasant
An extremely ugly female. Not even after 40+ beers at the pub would you consider taking this thing home. If ofcourse your standards do drop for a night. And you woke up with her asleep next to you, with her head on your arm. I recommend chewing your arm off, so you can make a quick escape without waking her up !
