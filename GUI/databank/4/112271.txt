compass crew
The third group of it's kind.The compass crew is a group that makes flashes based around characters with compasses for faces. Originally started somewhere around 2003, they had a couple good flashes. The most famous indeed is 'True North.' They did not last long though, it dide out after a while. Afterwords there were several attemps to revive the crew, all failed. Now there is currently one attemp that has been the most succesful and can be found at compasscrew.net
