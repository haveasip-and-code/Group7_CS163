scotland
Scotland is a country of true pride! any Scot knows that Scotland is a country which is beautiful and patriotic. 90% of Scots do hav a somewhat hateful streak in them but, that is directed to the English , and perhaps French n Germans. ; We may not be the best at sports but, think of all the great inventors! We invented so many things eg the telephone , the steamboat etc etc. ; However , Scotland holds the record for highest scoring international lacrosse match , when the Scots defeated Germany 34-3 in 1994.SUCK THAT YA ENGLISH PRICKS! WHAT HAPPENED IN 1966??? ; And finally ,Scots are loved the world over , for the hate for the english.I must say though , when i enter an american restauraunt , in eg Florida , the waitress will ask , 'are you english' , i will reply , 'no scottish' , and everytime this happens , the waitress breaths a huge sigh or relief
