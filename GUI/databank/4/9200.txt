Arse Genie
1) A small amount of watery excrement that shouldn't be in your underpants but is. ; Arse genies manifest for no known reason, not because of shock or following through when you attempt to pass wind or any other legitimate reason for shitting yourself. Very often the first a person will know of their arse genie is a slippery sensation between the arse cheeks when walking which is often mistaken for sweat. It is only when they go to wipe the sweat away and realise that it is brown that they know they have a genie. ; 2) An actual genie that that may attempt to persuade you to rub their rusty sherrifs badge in exchange for wishes.
