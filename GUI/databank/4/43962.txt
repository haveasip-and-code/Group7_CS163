Yonkers
Contrary to popular belief, Yonkers is one of the safest cities in the United States if you consider that Yonkers is about 200,000 strong. People who tout otherwise are disinterested in using logic and/or facts. To their credit, Southwest Yonkers (home of the lovely Schlobaum and Mulford Gardens) is absolutely brutal. ; The city is coming around. With its perfect residence on the Hudson River (which is a great landmark nobody cares about), Yonkers is rebuilding the waterfront and looking to return to its roots when the city was tabbed, 'The City of Gracious Living.'
