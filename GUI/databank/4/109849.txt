Wetz
South Dakotan slang originating from the Chamberlain/Oacoma area during the early 21st Century. The term is used to describe: ; A) Arrogant sociopaths suffering from delusions of grandeur and a grossly exaggerated sense of self-importance. ; B) An ignorant sadist who delights in torturing others with repeated melodramatic recollections of past feats of sexual prowess, sporting abilities, or superhuman feats of strength which grow more exaggerated with every telling of a patently false story. ; C) A narcissist who takes joy in rudely condeming the shortcomings of others because he/she is something greater than a mere mortal.
