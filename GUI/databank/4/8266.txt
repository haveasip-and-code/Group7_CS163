Code Blue
A total school lockdown, usually done in public schools about twice a week. All the classroom doors are locked, the windows are covered, and the students have to put their heads down. Teachers usually either run away or hide under their desks. ; Reasons for a Code Blue are the presence of guns or knives, major fights, or bomb threats. The annoucement comes over the P.A., and is usually ignored if no shots are heard.
