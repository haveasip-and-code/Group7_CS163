galitskiy
The galitskiy is the unit of sunshine (propensity to be egotistical). It is named after a well-known and loved physics teacher. ; If you exceed one galitskiy in sunshine, you are a 'sunshine boy', because you think the sun follows right behind you at all times. It is a logarithmic scale; one additional galitskiy is ten times as much sunshine. It works like pH.
