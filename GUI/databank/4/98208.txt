gig butt
A painful rash that occurs around your ass when working/walking in a hot climate for extended periods of time. This is caused by the bacteria around your anus thriving in a hot and dark environment. When experiencing gig butt, walking like a bow-legged cowboy is only a bandaid fix. Washing your anus (which is painful with gig-butt) is the only remedy or in a pinch, the use of baby wipes or Tucks medicated pads works wonders.
