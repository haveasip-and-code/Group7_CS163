Hyde Park  NY
Many of the caucasion teenagers here think they are cool, and hard- but they are neither. Hyde park kids live in places like Clinton Corners and Staatsburg. Hyde park kids are not cool, and definitely not hard. They tend to only fight in groups. Most of these kids drive sooped up hondas that are still slow.
