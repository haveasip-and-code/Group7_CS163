Oswego
Shit ass city of under 20,000 on the edge of Lake Ontario. Despite its historical successes, the city has evolved into slums galore and is now home to 3 area nuclear plants, mayors trading sex with little girls for drugs and money, lending cars to girl-friends (btw mayor is married), teachers give kids back their weed and the school administrators deal Meth. Also, where the police chief is a grand larcenist. The only true fame to the city is it's University which is the city's only untouched 'gem'
