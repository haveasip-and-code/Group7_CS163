rockabilly
A music and fashion subculture started in the mid-late seventies in the UK. Seventies teenagers developed their own dress code based on 1950s American Juvenile Delinquent novels and Hot Rod B-movies. ; Puttin distance between themselves and the older 'Teddy Boys' who attended the same clubs and dances at the time. ; Their taste in music was for the more primitive hillbilly-rock hybrid 'rockabilly' that kicked off in the mid fifties at the same time as its more succesful and commercial sibling - 'rock and roll'. ; The rockabilly scene still exists today.
