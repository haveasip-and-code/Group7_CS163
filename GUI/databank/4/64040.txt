Heinous Anus
Noun- The number one greatest punk band on the planet, started in November of 2004 by the great Sam Stark (look up definition), and formed in the attic of Doug Mitchell(look up definition)'s home in Gilsum, NH. Sam Stark plays the mean lead guitar, Doug Mitchell on the bass, Greg Brown on the sick ass drums, and Sam Wyman just fucks around. They are an amazing band with many fans around the Monadnock region in New Hampshire. There debut show will be on April 20th 2005, at the Monadnock High School talent show. Be there, motherfuckers.
