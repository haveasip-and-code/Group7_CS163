minneapolis
Where Prince used to live. He can't even stand it there anymore since it's become the so-called 'cultural capital' of the Great Midwest. Snooty and white, half the population likes to think that it is of Scandinavian heritage and likes to speak in faux 'Minnesota Accents.' Used to call itself 'The Minneapple' as if it were even remotely on the same scale as NYC. Traffic jams galore, high taxes, losing sports teams, Minneapolis has nothing to offer. St. Paul, although plagued with its own problems, is still a more down to earth and better place to live and work.
