england spirit
Being outplayed for 95% of a football match by a far superior team, but somehow managing to stay level with them due to a five minute period of scoring a couple of goals, which usually includes a Liverpool player blatantly diving for a penalty (which nobody bats an eyelid about) and hanging on for penalties. ; If it was any other team, especially against England, they'd be labelled 'cynical', 'negative' or old fashioned 'cheating bastards', which England's moronic fans will bleat about for at least twenty years afterwards.
