Alfa Romeo
An Italian car company that produces fun, fast sports cars and performance saloons (Sedans). Europeans like them but americans are obviously quite snobby and prefer their instant fuel tank drainers! Alfa Romeo is owned by FIAT and in the beginning AR owned Darraq, a well renowned manufacturer of now vintage cars. Post 1990 Alfa Romeos are a world away from the rusting, unreliable machines they were in the 1960's and can comfortably challenge Mercedes and BMW in europe.
