Magical Trevor
He's back, and he's got a new trick. He's ten times as slick as the last time you saw him, and now you can see why we really adore him. You might think his new trick is sick, sawing a pigeon in half with a stick. ; Anyway, he's freakin' awesome and I think he's into S&M... I dunno what's up with that magic leather whip, hm....
