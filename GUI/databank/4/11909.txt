Dallas-Fort Worth
The sea of cookie cutter suburban hell set in the middle of North Central Texas. Also called The Dallas/Fort Worth [Metroplex] or [DFW] by locals. All the Metroplex cities are the same. If you were beamed into Arlington, Grapevine or Farmers Branch or Garland or Plano, you wouldn't be able to tell which one you were in. How are you supposed to distinguish among various outlets of Mattress Giants, look alike subdivisions and thousands of redundant strip malls?
