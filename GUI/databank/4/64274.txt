evil donovan
Origin is hazy, but could possibly come from a small town in New York, most likely in the Upstate region. Legend has it that the first skateboarder in this town was an evil elf named Donovan. He would skate through the streets, yelling incoherent babble at teh school children. Such phrases as, 'You're grounded!' and 'Cow little chico fro' could sometimes be made out, but not often. Legend also has it that if Evil Donovan would also steal tater tots from unsupecting children.
