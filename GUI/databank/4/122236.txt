Wake Me Up When September Ends
A song by Green Day about not wanting the summer to end and having to deal with going back to our normal lives, time going by too fast, etc. Things that are on your mind before school starts. Basically the only good song on Green Day's new CD because everyone can relate to it and you can actually understand what Billie Joe is saying which is hard to do on most Green Day songs.
