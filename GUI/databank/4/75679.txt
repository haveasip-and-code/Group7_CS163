konyo
the bane of philippine society ; airheaded nouveau riche kids who come from a generation of linguistic mongrels and thus their lack of proficiency in both english and tagalog. they mix the two languages and think that 'make + tagalog verb' (eg make kulit, make kain, make away, etc.) is an actual grammatical form. they love to brag about new gadgets and think that anyone who doesn't have a camera-phone must be really pathetic. ; it's ignorant, baseless, and hurtful to brand ateneans collectively konyo. they can't help it if most of them (but not all) speak good english and you don't (ie not 'braggy' whatever that means) . by the way, filipino classes at the university are notoriously tough but challenging. they equip the student with at least above-average skill in the native language. thus, they know better than konyo kids.
