chorey
wannabe chav slang. generally used by tenagers in edinburgh who have to put on scottish accents to look 'cool'. a word they invented to add to this [alter ego] is chorey, meaning to 'steal'. many arguments have sprouted since the formation of this word, as many non-ned-wannabe's still believe that the word chorey along with [banter] and [wido] should be banned from being spoken.
