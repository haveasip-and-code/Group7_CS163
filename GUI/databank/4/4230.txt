Apple-eptic Shock
This is a condition that can happen to a person who has recently purchased an Apple conputer. To them, the world seems a little duller, a little more nonsenseical. Simptoms include: Long blank gazes at the Apple's interface and/or hardware design, shutting out of external stimulous such as telephone, email or personal contact and in extreme cases the user may stop eating.
