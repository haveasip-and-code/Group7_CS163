Douche Baggins
A compound noun that cleverly combines the niche phrase 'douche bag' with the protagonist Hobbit family name from the popular mid-fifties fantasy-adventure series 'The Lord of the Rings'. There is no specific context of 'Douche Baggins', though it could possibly be used in tandem with other terms of the same catagory also derived from characters in 'The Lord of the Rings'. Some examples may include, but are not limited to: ; - Dildo Baggins ; - Chodo Baggins ; - Bilbo Faggins ; - Gandalf the Gay ; This phrase may also refer to a 'Lord of the Rings' advocate who may be a [douche bag], or who is showing signs of [douche baggery] at a critical level.
