Kirupa
A website, a man, a forum. ; The community is by far the most closly woven communities I've ever seen online. At KirupaForum.com everyone is family! (Well, not those newbs that ask you to make something for them on their first post.) ; Kirupa.com is Kirupa's first site. It has some of the greatest tutorials for web development programs you'll ever run across. You might have seen www.kirupa.com one time or another, afterall, it's one of the first 5 results on google is you search for 'flash tutorials.' ; Kirupa sites are owned by who else but Kirupa! Kirupa is a smart dude who goes to MIT. Kirupa is a pimp. Pimping is what Kirupa does. When Kirupa graduates it's pretty clear that he's going to take place of Bill Gates and finally get Microsoft into good, working shape. Kirupa is probably one of the web's most stalked guy. (Afterall, we all know where he lives.... MIT)
