Redneck chrome
Slang term for duct tape, specifically applied to make stuff look like it was chromed (such as cars.) it is extremely cheap and easy to get, and non toxic, unlike real chrome, rednecks always have a few dozen rolls of it in the shed (or truck.) It can be used to dress up your house, car, head, or cat.
