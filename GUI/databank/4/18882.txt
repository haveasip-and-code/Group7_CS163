mabate
A word originally used to describe self-manipulation. It evolved into a description of what one intends to do with the course of the day, ie, to replace the common slang term 'nm'. It then completely degenerated into a word that, once said, would be repeated by every person within a twenty foot radius, reminiscent of the seagulls from Finding Nemo.
