Ruger
As said above a great gun company that exceeds in excellence. What was forgot was there model Mini-14, the .223 semi-automatic rifle that was modeled after the M-14 .308 caliber rifle. They also made the Mini-14 type rifle chambered in 7.62x39 called the Mini-Thirty. The Mini-14 can also just be called a Mini in casual conversation if the second party knows of what your speaking.
