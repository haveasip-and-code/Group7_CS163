ShityRail
Undeniably THE worst public transport system in the world, and an absolute embarrassment to [Australia]. The metropolitan train network in [Sydney] - which might get you where you're going... eventually; but you'd be quicker and safer walking. A third-world country in the middle of a civil war could still manage to run a better rail service than ShityRail.
