WWJD
A simplistic acronym meaning 'What Would Jesus Do' originally adopted by well meaning Christians who wanted to express their desire to follow Christ in a primitve way. Never had much social impact. The letters can actually mean other things, like: 'Who Was James Dean' or 'Who Was Jack Dempsey' or 'Who Was J.D. salinger' or 'Who Was J.D. rockefeller' or 'What Was Juris Doctorate'.
