Millwall
Millwall are supposed to have the worst fans in the history of football, that is not a fact at all, it is in fact very wrong, they only ever show millwall on the TV, thats the worst DOWN SOUTH, look up north, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and even Glasgow if you go high enough, don't get me started with the southern fairies, they just cry because they get beat.
