yorkshire terrier
Edit- A yorkshire terrier is a breed of small, obnoxious, ridiculously loud for its size dog that was bred in Yorkshire, England, for hunting rats. They bred these small irritating dogs because the King did not want the citizens to have dogs large enough to hunt the royal deer. So the yorkie was born, a little dog that is unrivaled in being sickeningly cute, to the point where you want to cave its little face in with a blunt instrument. ; Yorkies have horrible tempers; they will frequently dig their needle-sharp teeth into people for no apparent reason, such as when they sit next to one of these dogs within six feet of them on a different couch. They pick fights with dogs six times their size, which is amusing, especially when a mastiff or something rips it to pieces. Yorkies become loyal to one master, and they hate everyone else and will bite complete strangers. I've seen it happen, and it happened to me once too. ; If you have a yorkie in your house do not try to talk the owner into seeing how much of a little terror the dog is. Simply take it outside, tie it up, pull out a shotgun (I would reccommend a 16 gauge or bigger for maximum effect) and blow the little creature all over the pavement, then follow up by burning the remains just to be sure.
