Challenger School
Non-religious private schools (K-8) started by Barbara Baker which began as a preschool sometime in the early '80s. There are branches in Utah, Nevada, and Northern California. The curriculum is hard (ie. Geometry is mandatory for all 8th graders and kindergarteners are required to learn the times table) with a practically nonexistant sports or music program. ; Also a breeding ground for [fobs] or wanna-be gangster Indians and Viets or little I love [Hilary Duff] 'OMG I'm so punk rawk' [poseurs].
