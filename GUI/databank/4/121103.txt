kiss me again
a more polite way of saying 'Fuck', ; kiss in arabic means Pussy, so Arabs say Kiss and then they go on with 'Me Again' so they transfer the meaning from Arabic to English. ; I will explain more, An Arabic person is angry of something that happened so he uses the word of anger (Kiss)=pussy but the use is exactly when a enlish person says 'Fuck' for anger. ; so when he says Kiss infront of others it is not nice, (it is not nice to say fuck either ;) ); so he goes one with Me Again ...so it becomes Kiss me Again!
