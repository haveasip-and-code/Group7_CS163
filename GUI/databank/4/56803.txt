Three yard elf
'Keep in mind, however, that the Xbox and the Gamecube, both of which technically only have the graphical capabilities of a 3 yard elf PC, are still getting extremely good looking games, and even decent ports of newish PC games.' ; This comment was added to a thread created by 'impseth' entitled 'Console design moving away from PC' on the Penny Arcade 'Games and Technology' forum. ; When author 'aeolist' originally coined the phrase, he typed it as '3 yard elf' which caused much confusion to those following the thread. Aeolist later identified it as a typographical error: 'It's the most bizarre typo for 'year old' possible.' ; The term, used in the erroneous, is now used to imply a note of disdain in a given subject matter, topic, or thing. It may even be used to implicate the afore mentioned in a direct insult as well. ; Both '3 yard elf' and 'three yard elf' are grammatically correct usages of this slang.
