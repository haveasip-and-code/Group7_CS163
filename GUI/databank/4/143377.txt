Gadsden Purchase
Gadsden Purchase ; A deviant sexual act, in the tradition of the [donkey punch] and the [Cleveland steamer], named after the purchase of a portion of what is now Arizona from Mexico in 1853. ; The sexual act proceeds thusly: ; 1. Go to Tijuana, or some such lawless Mexican border town with plenty of brothels and prostitution. ; 2. Find a Mexican prostitute, and promise her lots of money for standard [doggy-style] sex. ; 3. Just as you 'finish,' roll up the money you owe her and stick it in her [cornhole]. ; 4. Congratulate yourself on symbolically continuing the American tradition of unabashedly fucking over the rest of the world.
