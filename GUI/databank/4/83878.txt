runescape member
A paying member of the Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game known as Runescape. These people are usually thought of as 'nerds' or 'geeks' who say pwned in real life because they just discovered the word from an online forum. They are not considered nerds because they play an MMORPG(MMORPG's are quite cool), it is the fact that Runescape lacks decent graphics, gameplay or music. These people are usually high leveled which is due to them spending most of their time wasted on 'training'.
