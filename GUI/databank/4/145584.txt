mantes
Known to most of capitol america as 'boxer-briefs', these are panties for men. They have the look of boxers, but the material and support of classic whites. They offer more support to men suffering from 'saggy sack', or 'incongested cock'. ; NOTE: not to be confused with 'tighty whiteys', or 'shlong johns', which are other nicknames for male undergarments.
