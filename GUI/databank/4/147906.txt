Quite possibly the capital Area of the world. No, really. Think about it: ; All continents were once Africa, which makes it the geological capital of the Earth. ; South Africa is the closest to 1st world in Africa, making it the capital country of Africa. ; Gauteng is the capital province of Africa. ; Johannesburg is the capital of Gauteng. ; Northern Johannesburg is the capital area of Jo'burg. ; Sandton is the Capital area of Northern Johannesburg. ; I, thus conclude, that Sandton is the capital of the world. And there r hot chix an nice houses too!!
