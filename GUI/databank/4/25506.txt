Vorlon
An alien race from the popular cult sci-fi show, [Babylon 5]. The Vorlon are among the most enigmatic beings in the galaxy, and are said to be very ancient. ; A Vorlon is characterised by a suit that looks like a coat hanger, and a habit of speaking in riddles or nonsensical phrases. In this context, many have theorised that what hides under the suits is, in fact, a race of [homsar]s. Even more, however, suggest that they are in fact permanently on [LSD]. ; What they really are, remains unknown, but saying they look like question marks riding a conceptualisation of the colour blue towards a rainbow-colored watermelon that is having sexual intercourse with an eggplant seems like a good bet. ; adj.: Someone who speaks nonsense or in riddles, or acts like they are on acid.
