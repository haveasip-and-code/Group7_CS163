If the highlight isnt seeing the groups on underage chavs down your local, then its surely the large single mass of uni students going to every possible indie gig in the town as they now see themselves as 'cool' cus theyve moved out from home. If music isnt your thing, go for a meal at san carlo, who closed cus of rat infestation yet reopened, or even go for a days shopping in Selfridges, where you can pick up a handbag for the price of a ford fiesta
