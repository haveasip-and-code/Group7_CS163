Pencil Case
A receptacle, usually a small bag, or rather, a 'case,' used to contain pencils, as well as pens, markers, other obscure writing utencils. Also contained may be stationary items such as white out, white out tape, highlighters, paper clips, scissors, post-it notes, mini post-it notes, brightly colored post-it notes, post-it notes in fun shapes, mini staplers, mini staples, mini rulers, mini tape measurers, protractors, compasses, mini calculators, and the odd brad or two. Some students like to store their breathmints (preferred brand: vicky's mints) and/or pieces of gum in their pencil cases for easy access. ; Pencil cases are available in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and patterns, usually a bit longer than the length of a pencil. Everyone has a practical use for one. Young third grade students may use the larger, plastic models to store their crayolas and gluesticks, while disgruntled eighth period honors precalc/ trigonometry teachers have a more complex model with many zippers and straps to organize contents. A dandy surprise content of a teenage student's pencil case would be a condom.
