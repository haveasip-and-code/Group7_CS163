tight as a vise
Phrase used to describe a girl's vagina when it is too tight or nesarly too tight for her partner's penis to penetrate. While it is common for a virgin to be as tight as a vise, many sexually active young women can be this tight for quite awhile, sometimes until they have a child or they have sex with a partner who has a large girth.
