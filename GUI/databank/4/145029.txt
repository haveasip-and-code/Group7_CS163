wannarexia
1. An imaginary disease most commonly found amongst preteen to teenage, overweight, females whom claim to have the eating disorder [anorexia], but they do not meet the criteria. In fact, they do not have an eating disorder at all. Most wannarexic people feel that anorexia is a 'quick fix' to lose weight and that it is glamorous.
