True Romance
The best date movie ever. It is about a guy, Clarence (Christian Slater) who marries a prostitute, Alabama (Patricia Arquette). Slater kills her pimp and goes to get her belongins back, only the bag he thinks is hers is actually the mob's cocaine. ; The reason it is the best date movie ever is because it has lots of pretty cool romance for her and sweet action and gangsta shit for him. ; Easily the best bathroom fight scene ever.
