Nightingale syndrome
Based off the 'Nurse with the Lamp', Florence Nightingale was apparently an extremely adept nurse. While not technically a medical syndrome, Nightingale Syndrome is known to be used to describe the situation in which a patient falls in love with his/her medical caretaker due to the vague bond created when healed by a complete stranger.
