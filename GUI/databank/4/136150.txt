Strippiest
What Grampa Simpson used to describe a 'new age stripper wife' in an episode in which they conned people out of their money for a while. Grampa was acting out in a con pretending to win a million dollars when he said 'I'm going to get me one of those new age stripper wives, it'll be the strippiest, wifiest-' then stopped to fake his own demise in a heartattack.
