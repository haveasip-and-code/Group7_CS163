Steve Vai
A modern guitar virtuoso. One of the most talented guitar players to date, he is world renown for his ability to play nearly any style and excell beyond most all of his peers. After teaching himself to play, and attending Berkley College of Music, he took a few lessons from fellow guitar playing great Joe Satriani. Vai in the 80's played around, never settling and playing for one band at length, his more notable bands were that of Frank Zappa and Whitesnake. In the late 80's he went solo producing many groundbreaking instrumental albums displaying his talent on guitar, and later album his vocals as well. He is often thought to have an outlandish and undisirable style (although his style is never very consistant), and is thought to be annoying to more close minded listeners. He is not very known outside the guitarist community, mostly because instrumental guitarists arent well recieved. He is however, a very good musician and is worth picking up a record of his to listen to.
