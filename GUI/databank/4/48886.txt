Yu Gi Oh
1. A stupid, slow moving and over-all poor quality cartoon about a card game in a fictional setting where this card game is more popular than it is in real life. It has a lot of symbolic insults toward western religion and cultures. It is made by a cartoon company that draws characters that dress in a way that sugests a culture of buggery among the employees that probably resulted from those employees being isolated from women or at least acceptable dating options because they are most likely forced to always stay in a compound away from the outside world by a corporation that has sexist hiring practices. ; 2. A card game that shares many of the same descriptions as the above entry.
