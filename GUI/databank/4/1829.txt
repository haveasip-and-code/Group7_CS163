frosty
when one must use the bathroom excessively and repeatedly. Background: one day at Starbucks, we treated our friend Tim to a venti-sized chai creme frappacino, despite his refusal. when he got up and went to the bathroom, he said 'frosty,' and now everytime he has to use the bathroom, we repeat the word 'frosty.'
