Cindy Sheehan
A rather unfortunately simple-minded woman who made headlines for demanding a meeting with president Bush regarding the death of her son in Iraq. Sheehan and others who opposed the war in Iraq staged an extended demonstration outside president Bush's ranch in Crawford, TX. ; Sheehan said she felt that her son did not die for a noble cause, but that he died in a war that was based on 'lies and betrayal' i.e. no weapons of mass destruction, no proven links to Al Qaeda, etc. ; Her credibility was dramatically affected by contradicting statements and by a general inability to express herself coherently, especially in reference to the connection between the death of her son and Bush's decision to start an illegitimate war and subsequently continue his conquest for total world domination. ; Sheehan's protest was effectively ended when the nation's news media fled Crawford to report on hurricane [Katrina] which struck the gulf coast region on August 29th 2005.
