Your Mom Goes To Collage
An insult regarding the artistic ability of a person's female parent, especially in regards to the cutting-up and re-gluing of pictures from magazines. ; Found especially among students of Graphic or Interior Design, as no one else cares (or knows) about the artistic abilities of their mother. ; This insult is perhaps a parody of misspelling/mispronunciation of [Kip Dynamite]'s crushing yet witty line [your mom goes to college].
