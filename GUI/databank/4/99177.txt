Texas State University
The renamed 'Southwest Texas State University' so that they seem less 'localized'. Located in San Marcos, TX, approx. 30 minutes south of Austin. Where college students attend when they don't get into the University of Texas. ; They have a nationally acclaimed business school. The campus is beautiful but the town is full of Mexicans. Students go to [Sixth Street] in Austin or float the San Marcos River for their fun. Texas State has a bit of a 'party school' reputation... but in truth it's not any worse/better than and other American University.
