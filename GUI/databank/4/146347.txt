five-paragraph essay
A widespread and mind-numbing writing appliance used by uncreative teachers and schools to spread dissatisfaction with writing among their students. Though 'creative' five-paragraph essays have been written, the form is generally mandated by dull minds to make writing and thinking dull. ; All five-paragraph essays begin with an introduction ('tell 'em what you're gonna tell 'em!') followed by three body paragraphs ('tell 'em!') and a frighteningly repetetive conclusion ('tell 'em what you told 'em!').
