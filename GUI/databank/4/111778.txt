road rash
commonly acquired from bailing at top speed while operating a multi-wheeled street plunging apparatus, especially a skateboard or inline skates, road rash is a slang term used to describe the assorted flesh wounds resulting from such dangerous behavior. often, the term is used by one seeking to elaborate and intensify his/her recent extreme skate adventures. depending on the severity of the road rash, one may experience prolonged bleeding, pussing, and uncomfortable stinging. discoloration, scabs, and scarring of the epidermis is common. there is little treatment for road rash; keep wounds clean, refrain from furthur injury and stay away from the streets, rest, and consult your doctor if necessary. otherwise, enjoy showing off scars and battle wounds to your friends and anyone else interested.
