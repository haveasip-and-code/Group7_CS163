ann coulter
A [Rush Limbaugh] [wannabe]. A highly [conservative] [bitch] who dresses like a [hooker], and writes about her view that all [liberal]s are evil (there's bad liberals, sure, but there's a slew of bad conservatives, too), and bashes the likes of [Bill Clinton] and other liberals... and she supports her fellow anti-Equal Rights crusader, [Phyllis Schlafly]. Both of these women need some major counseling... and a good whack in the face.
