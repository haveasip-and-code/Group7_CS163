ferndown
A town near the sunny beaches of bournmouth. Its small and insignificant compared to bournmouth's blue beaches. Its full to the brim with old people who come floking out of there homes on a thursday to collect there pension and make it impossible to move round the town a your surrounded by old smelly wrinkly people. Ferndown upper school is more like ferndown institute for the disorderly as it is turning into a prison with huge fences and is ocupied by more kakkers and chavs than mc donalds!
