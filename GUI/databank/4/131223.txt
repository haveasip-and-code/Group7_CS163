shadows fall
A very in your face metal band from Massachussetts. I have seen them live many times and they are just amazing. They have some of the greatest solos and instrumentals I've heard in a long time. They have one flaw though. The vocalist(Brian Fair) sounds like he is trying way to hard and it does not sound natural. But besides that they kick fucking ass.
