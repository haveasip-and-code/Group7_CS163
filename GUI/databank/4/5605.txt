The Gump
In this case, it would be a DIFFERENT kind of [gump]. Not the tall, lanky kind. ; This quadrupedal [gump] is quite large and stocky, and often a pale, creamy color, with a peach-colored streak down its back. The [gump] is called so because of the sound it often makes. ; [Gump]s are rather fond of eating, and are prone to being attacked by poodles and weasels. [Gump]s take up large amounts of space and often get in your way.
