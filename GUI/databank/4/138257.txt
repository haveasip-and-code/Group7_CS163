inner beauty
A term ugly, undesirable and inadequate people use to make themselves feel less ugly, more desirable and sexually adequate. This phrase goes alone the lines of adages such as, 'Looks are only skin deep,' and 'It's what's on the inside that counts,' although everyone knows the adage should really be, 'It's what's on the outside that counts.'
