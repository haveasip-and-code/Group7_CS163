Mexican Demo
A Bootleg. Similar to an Italian Import but more of a modern term to describe bootleg CDs that may have been made on home equipment rather than a pressing plant over seas. Used to describe a bootleg without saying the word. Typically found in the music industry and sold in smaller music stores.
