SEGA Sandwich
The [SEGA Genesis], with [SEGA CD] attachment, on top of the Genesis is the [SEGA 32x] expansion, on top of that is the Game Genie cheating code device, on top of that is game Sonic and Knuckles, and on top of that is the game Sonic the Hedgehog 2. When said items are combined in that order, the SEGA Sandwich is born.
