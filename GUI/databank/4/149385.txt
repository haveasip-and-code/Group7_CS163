cwapface
the definition of 'cwapface' was derived by a certain being who had no comback to such sayings as 'im over it,' 'dont worry about it,' and the oh so famous 'whatever.' no one ever really responds to that unless it was like forced to create another lame conversation. so thus the birth of the word 'cwap face' was born. Although it doesn't really correctly follow the english spelling, it was derived by a loser kid that i happen to talk to, and well. it just hit me that there are other people like him that might want to use that word.
