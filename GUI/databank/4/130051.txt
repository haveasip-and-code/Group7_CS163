briscola
Briscola is a popular Italian card game, together with scopa and tressette. Its name comes from the french 'brisque'. It is played with a 40 card deck. It is often played with Italian cards, which have suits of coins, cups, batons and swords, but you may play using a standard card deck, just by removing the Jokers, eights, nines and tens.
