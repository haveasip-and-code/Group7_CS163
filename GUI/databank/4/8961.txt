North Jersey
a land of contrast, where the factories and poor towns are about 15 miles south of Manhattan,where the middle class towns are about 5-20 miles west of Manhattan, and where The Rich Towns entire Bergen, Passaic, Western Essex,a dn north Union County. Also where there are at least 1 mall close to your house that has stores like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Cartier, and Burberry. If you could choose anywhere to liv in the world, choose North Jersey, Beacuse its got a beautiul landscape, is really rich, and has easy access to the largest city in the USA!
