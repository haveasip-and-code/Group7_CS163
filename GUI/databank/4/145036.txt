drainp
shortened version of 'drainpipes' ie very tight trousers. ; the use of 'drainp' was originally founded by ashley and aziz, who have recently developed a language totally devoted to shortening any word...if it sounds right. ; for example: ; drainpipes = drainp ; guildford = guilf ; house of fraser = house of frase ; positive tension (by bloc party) = pos tensh (by bloc part) ; arctic monkeys = ark monk ; banquet = banq ; etc etc etc....
