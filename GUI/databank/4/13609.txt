hapa
hapa is a hawaiian word that was originally part of the full phrase: hapa haole, which was a derogatory term for someone half hawaiian and half 'white foreigner.' Today, the phrase has been shortened to simply 'hapa' and genreally refers to anyone part Asian or Pacific Islander and, generally, part caucasian. However, the definition of 'hapa' has come more and more to mean 'half' or 'of mixed blood' in which case many different racial combinations are beginning to fall under the umbrella of 'hapa'.
