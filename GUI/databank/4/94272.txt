felebrity
Basically, it's like this... A felebrity is someone who has achieved a z-list status through some obscure manor. For instance, current people on BB6,000,000 (that's what it feels like!) will achieve nationwide recognition for being on a crappy little programme that should have been put to bed after the first one was over! Also, who the fuck is Fran Cosgrove? A night club owner?! Wow! If only I owned a night club, then i'd get to go on these stupid, pointless, money and life sapping shows. Oh well!
