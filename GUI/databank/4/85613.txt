Clitoris Rex
Very small dinosaur that inhabited the vulva mounds during the jurassic period. Though no direct evidence of it's existance has ever been documented, it is widely speculated to be a close relative of the larger Penisourus. This carnivorous dinosour was protected by an elastic sheath called the clit hood. It is assumed that the Clitoris Rex emerges from it's hood only when feeding. It's diet consisted of direct penile, finger and tounge stimulation.
