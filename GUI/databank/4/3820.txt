pin the tail game
A sexual party game usually practiced in high school or college where one party goer is stripped naked and blindfolded. Other party guests take turns giving head or screwing the blingfolded person after which the blindfolded person must try to guess who each was. Each guest takes a turn being blindfolded. The winner is the person who correctly identifies the most people who had sex with them.
