squirelly
Crazed, wacked out dog whose rear legs fully extend past the front two while in a full-out running motion. When on grass, turf flies left, right and center. Can be caused by screaming a spastic 'squirelly' multiple times until the dog flips out. Must emphasize that it must be screamed as: 'squir-leeeeeeeeee' over and over, with enough force to make your face turn red.
