SUMMIT...8th floor   6th floor  and their groupies
Summit...a dorm hall for the elite group of West Virginia University Students. When we say elite, we mean the most raging acholics and pot heads in morgantown. We even have groupies from other floors and dorms that could only wish they were lucky enough to live on the 8th or 6th floor. Classes never get in the way of our extracurricular activies AKA partyin. The 8th floor girls have formed their own sorority on campus called TTK (Tappa Tappa Kegga). We roll deep and take over Shooters everytime we go out. We know every bar owner, shot girl, bartenders and bouncer working in Morgantown. Everyother girl works at one of Motown's bars. Bedtime is when the sun comes up and waking up to the sunset is a normal day. ; ONE LOVE
