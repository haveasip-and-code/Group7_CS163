Franktown
1. (n.) A nickname for the town Franklin, Tennessee. ; 2. (adj.) Of or referring to the town of Franklin. ; 3. (interj.) A word in a chant typically made by students of Franklin High School, usually in conjunction with a interrogative pronoun; i.e. 'Franktown WHAT?' ; Etymology: The rapper Cadence (now DJ Cadence), a graduate of Franklin High, coined this word some years ago, most likely in 2002. The word is a neologism based on the word 'Franklin,' a picturesque and historic suburb of roughly 35,000 inhabitants just south of Nashville, Tennessee. ; Use: It should be noted that in every part of speech that it takes on, the word 'Franktown' carries a certain connotation of [gangsta]ness, though said quality is usually pretended for the amusement of the speaker and/or his/her listeners. Ironically, many of the subjects about which Cadence raps, including tough streets and widespread violence, are by far the exception rather than the rule in Franklin, a generally peaceful and quiet city which stands as a monument to the harmonious integration of past, present, and future ways of life.
