Drexel Hill
Drexel Hill is NOT a 'small town.' Shippensburg is a small town, Drexel Hill is a neighborhood in Upper Darby Township and part of the highly-populated and crowded Philadelphia area. Located 10 minutes west of the City in Eastern Delaware County, Drexel Hill is a well-respected and overwhelmingly Catholic area. 'D-Hill' has more bars per capita than any other city, although it is easier to grab a bag of weed than a beer. There is ghetto Section 8 housing as well as luxurious mansions. Drexel Hill is a great place to live.
