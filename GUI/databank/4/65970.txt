Dry Dock
Dry Dock: v. To emulate sex with an engorged [fuck stick] but fully or partially clothed. Usually done by teenagers who aren't ready to do the real thing (maybe she's a [cherry]). It comes from the term for a ship out of water, as this teenaged boy's 'vessel' is not going to contact any liquid!
