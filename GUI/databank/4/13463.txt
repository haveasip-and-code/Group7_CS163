Cubicle Farm
A vast expanse of contemporary office space outfitted with box-like, synthetic personal work environments comprised of approximately 3.3 sides and lacking doors and ceilings. These cubicles are easy and inexpensive to assemble and their lack of privacy promotes comraderie among a sea of anonymous co-workers. Notably, a cubicle farm is where middle managers are grown.
