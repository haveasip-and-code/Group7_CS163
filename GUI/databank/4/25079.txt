planny
Adj. Used to describe someone who has to have everything they do planned and mapped out. Without a plan, this person feels lost and out of control. This does not mean this person stays at home and does nothing, but they are extremely uncomfortable 'flying by the seat of their pants'. This person needs to have their activities for the following weekend known by Tuesday afternoon, or they start to get very nervous. Only likes spontaneity under controlled circumstances.
