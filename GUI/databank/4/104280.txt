right-winger
Often, an American that is pro-business while being anti-worker - yet pro-family. Tends to portray great religiosity but only when threatened or bombed. Claims to believe in the sanctity of Life, but will bomb the fuck out of anything that moves. Also has a tendency to misinterpret any written document - especially the Bible. Believes that oil supplies will last forever.
