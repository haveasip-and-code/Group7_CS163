psycho chick
The Jekyll and Hyde female in her twenties. ; Having left childhood behind, these chicks now battle through their twenties. Here they are buffeted between the pressures of work, drinking, boy-friend merry-go-rounds, monthly hormone attacks and the belief that their clocks are ticking. ; Believe me, one day these chicks are heaven sent babes, then on the turn of a penny, the next day they are knife wielding harridans who relentlessly chant the mantra 'All men are bastards ... why can't I find a boyfriend ... I'll never have babies ... I don't need a man etc.' ; Avoid them while in this evolving stage. Good news is they normally get their shit together sooner or later and the story does very often end happily. ; Remember that every [milf] once was a psycho chick.
