fret wanking
2. when a guitarist plays an excessivly virtuoso solo which dominates (and often ruins) the song, or at least a hefty proportion of it. ; Either derives from the same thing as the previous definition, or from the fact that the guitarist in question is playing their solo so vehemently that they seem to be in love with themselves, and so are receiving (metaphorical) sexual pleasure from playing it (as one does when wanking)
