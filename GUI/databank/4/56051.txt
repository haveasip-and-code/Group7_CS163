Diversity
A bigotted policy that is over-emphasized to an incredibly irritating level. It is also used in the name of tolerance and progress, but it in fact happens to hold certain people down until people of a particular group gets things first. In addition, certain minorities are also left out in so-called 'Diversity Week' celebrations, especially those with mental disabilities and Native Americans.
