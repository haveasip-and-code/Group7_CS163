Zionism
An extremely racist belief that Jews deserve to take over the Palestinian's land with the backing of the U.S. military. Zionists use the history of persecution against Jews to rationalize this blatant breach of human rights, and then Israelis go on to murder thousands of Palestinians each year with the pretext that they have been attacked by terrorists. While it is true that some Palestinians attack Israelis, there are at least 4 fold more Palestinian than Israeli deaths each year.
