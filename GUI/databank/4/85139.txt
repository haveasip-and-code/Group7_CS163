trailer trash goth
A terribly unsuccessful attempt at the goth look that leaves the wearer looking a few chromosomes short. This most often occurs amongst A. those who are too poor to spend more than a dollar on any look (and in fact, probably do live in trailers) and B.[yuppie puppies]who most likely got distracted by the shiny chains in Hot Topic on their way to J. Crew.
