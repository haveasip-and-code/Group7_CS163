couch girl
A girl that is in rotation on the couch. One who sits on the couch staring blankly at the tv (be it a movie or a single player game) while the guy next to her randomly leaves her to go hit on other girls on AIM. Couch girls, not getting the hint, will proceed to insist upon staying the night and making the guy as uncomfortable as possible. ; See [annoying], [selfish], [flakey]
