Unshelved
A funny, daily comic strip by Bill Barnes and Gene Ambaum. It's about a public library in the ficticous city of Mallville. Main characters include Dewey, the young adult librarian; Mel, the head of the branch; Tamara, the children's librarian; Colleen, the old reference librarian; and Merv, a young kid that just hangs around the library but doesn't read. Buddy, a man wearing a beaver costume, and Ned, a naked attorney, also make appearances.
