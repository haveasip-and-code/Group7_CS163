firefox
Best browser out there. Oh, it only uses more resources than IE because IE is integrated in windows, therefore, IE uses all the resources that windows ues :p, it is slower for the same reason, it isn't integrated, but, it isn't a security hole, plus, it isn't made by microsoft, double plus, and it is much cooler, too cool to use with windows, switch to LINUX you fools! And drop the mac off in a dumpster on the way. Peace!
