Blackburn
1. A large town in east [Lancashire], [UK]. ; 2. The British [multicultural] 'dream' gone horribly wrong. A roughly 80% white and 20% Asian (of the [Pakistani]-heritage, Muslim variety) town.. the two groups seem so distant from each other we might as well call it apartheid. ; You have more chance of seeing Elvis than a white and Asian person having a conversation in the town centre. ; Both groups can pander to the worst possible stereotypes you could imagine. ; There is a race problem in the town, it's just people, whether the man in the street, or MP [Jack Straw] won't step up and admit to it. ; 3. One of the only towns that thought it a good idea to close down the main town centre nightclub, and then launch a new one on the top of... a multi-storey car park. Genius. ; (The place where a close friend of mine was beaten up for the hideous crime of getting into the wrong taxi by some stupid, well.. walking abortions [chavettes].. one of them had a child, I would put the poor kid into care myself...) ; 4. A town where a minority of fairly cool people, especially the younger generation, live, although those with sense often move away when they're old enough. ; 5. Every bad British 2000s stereotype you could imagine rolled into one. Like the lyrics of I Predict A Riot by the [Kaiser Chiefs] coming true. ; 6. Preston nearby isn't exactly Hollywood, but hell, this place makes it look like it. ; 7. The awful, god-forsaken place people have to waste time sitting around at to change trains travelling to Preston from the east. ; 8. A place which is supposed to be a shining example of the 'good ol', ey' up chuck' salt-of-the-earth Northwest.. hmm, apart from some of the older generation, I've yet to be convinced.
