extrEMO
This scene is all about being an 'emo' kid and a metalcore kid at the same time. If you like both genres of music then you are etrEMO. ; extrEMO kids don't have to follow the normal 'emo' rules in terms of dress sense, depression and stuff. The main thing is that you be yourself and not a veiled, shallow and vain stereotype. You don't HAVE to cry, you don't HAVE to pretend to be Bi all the time. There's just one rule: ; +Be true to yourself+
