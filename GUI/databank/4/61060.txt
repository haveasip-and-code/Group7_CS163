Instant Win
A term which originally became popular in the days of [Starcraft]. It was used to designate a particular strategy or attack which would guarantee victory for whomever was using it. It was often used in conjunction with the popular equation, '[Mass Carriers] = Instant Win'. The strategy of mass-producing the largest aerial unit in the game and using it as the sole attack force remained popular, and later spread into Warcraft 3, where it gained the updated equation, 'Mass Wyrms = Instant Win'.
