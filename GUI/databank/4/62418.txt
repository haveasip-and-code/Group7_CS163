Vigilante 8
Vigilante 8 is a driving/shooting game for the [Nintendo 64] and the [Play Staion]. ; You can choose from a variety of different vehicles even an alien space ship. Each vehicle has its own Special weapon that can be used to devastate enemies. ; The levels are fun and fully destructible. Each level usually hides some sort of secret. ; I believe that this game might be a copy of Twisted Metal. But this game is alot more fun. ; They need to start making this series again because there arent really any games out with lots of pure car destruction.
