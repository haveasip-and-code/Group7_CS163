Pokemon
A fun game made by Nintendo. Originally created in Japan, the game was the inspiration for the TV show (or anime) not the other way around. The game came first. At the beginning there were 151 pokemon, but Nintendo got greedy, and instead of letting the games die gracefully, they had to keep it going. The result is now over 380 Pokemon that (al after 250, anyway) look like circles and blobs with arms and legs. The television show has not fared as well either. The once exciting plot is now stale, dry, and boring. Oh well. Guess its just another thing that [jumped the shark]. ; Also, teh games are just remakes of the original plot of red and blue...does nobody agree with me here???
