San Ramon High
probably the worst school in the district, has nothing compared to the amazing school of Monte vista. has all ugly has girls who eat way too much dress horribly and wear so much makeup that they look like cross dresses. the guys are any better, they are either ghetto and think they are hardcore so they beat their girlfriends, or they are on football and take way to make steriods to try and beat monte vista, but wait they still dont. and the only reason why people transfer to sr from mv is because they are fat pussys and couldnt hack it at mv. or because they were so ugly they went to sr to make themselves feel pretty. sorry but u will always be fat and ugly
