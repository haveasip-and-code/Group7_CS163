Astral Projection
Astral Projection ; 1) The method in which an individual can seperate his conciousness from his physical body. (Also referred to as OBE or Out of Body Experience) This method occurs right before REM sleep. The mind is in a trance state called Foucs 10. Focus 10 means the body is asleep but the mind is awake. The common effects at this point are the ability to see through closed eyelids, vibrations occruing throughout the body, and or a falling sensation. The projected double, referred to as the Astral Double, may freely move through the Astral Planes or the Real Time Zone. The real Time zone is the closest thing to the physical, and has almost every sembelence to reality. The Astral planes are the higher planes in which one can travel. During a projection, people have reported, Flying, passing through solid objects, seeing into the past and future, communicating with the deceased, and visiting far away planets. This phenomenon can only be proven by the individual performing it. ; 2) The Goa Trance artists stationed in Israel. Their music is one of the most unique electronica you will ever hear.
