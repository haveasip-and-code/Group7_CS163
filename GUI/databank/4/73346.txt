HOLMDEL
Holmdel is a town in New Jersey. Most people know of it only because of the PNC Bank Arts Center. Holmdel has huge houses, each with a basketball hoop even if there are no kids living in the house. While driving you'll see THE nicest cars until a random deer decides to pop out of nowhere. If you live in Holmdel you know of the following: BestBuy, the smell of skunk, how to illegally access the parkway, roadkill, the mysterious Emu one town over that are supposed to be extinct, HHS sucks, the red flashing lights on Bethany for the train don't necessarily mean stop because the damn train takes an hour to get there - but who is stupid enough to try and cross the tracks with the arms down anyway, there is a local Sears you pass by every now and then, but never go in, you've gone well over the speed limit on South Holland, and your business is everyone else's in a matter of five seconds. The best things to do in Holmdel are ... oh, that's right, nothing.
