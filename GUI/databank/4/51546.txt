Linkin Park
A band that started off with my love and respect, but then lost it when i realised that they were just releasing re-done after re-done single and even re-done albums just to make cash! Honestly, how many times can you listen to one song be re-made? I was a huge fan of Linkin Park - i loved their lyrics - Chesters way of interpretating is amazing, and he is extremly talented - but enough of the re-releasing already - give us something fresh! And also - collaborating with Jay-Z, what were they thinking? The collaborationg with Marilyn Manson and such artists as him were the gold tracks - but Jay-Z - thats disappointing - another money maker!
