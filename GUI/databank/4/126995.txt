shrafted
Similar to the [Cleveland steamer]. This version is usually done as a hazing ritual. Whereas the hazee lays on his back under a short glass table or other transparent surface (ie. plastic tarp). The hazers then in turn move thier bowels onto the transparent surface just over the hazees face.
