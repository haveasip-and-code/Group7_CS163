exidence
exidence is inexplicable. Its creation is shrouded in mystery. Ambiguous in its meaning, esoteric in its usage - exidence is not a word used by the masses in the vernacular. Lo! exidence is not a word; nay, it is not a vernacular tool for common folk. It is a perplexing concept. It is the seed of euphoria. Once rooted into one's soul, the host is at once elevated to a state of gaiety.
