ice skater
a speed skater, hockey player, [figure skater], ice dancer, etc. the term 'ice skater' is not actually all that specific, evn tho ppl often translate it as [figure skater]. if u were looking 4 a definition on [figure skater] then i suggest u search for [figure skater bcuz that will prolly b much more helpful......a figure skater is an ice skater but an ice skater is not necessarily a figure skater.
