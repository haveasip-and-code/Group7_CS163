jay-z
One of the best hip hop artists, known for his feud with nas. Recently Jay-z and nas alledgedly squashed there beef as well as jadakiss and 50 cent (after kiss' song called checkmate where he brutally cuts up 50). Jay-z was friends with biggie but it's absolutly ludacris to say he was best friends. One thing that made me mad is Jay-z taking the name for his album 'blueprint' from Krs one. Black album was a decent album, for quality of lyrics, id say jay-z and nas are pretty much even but for better flowing music i'd say nas takes it. ; However I am still a strong believer that jay-z may have had a ghost writer in the past. and jay-z is DEFINATLY NOT the best rapper to live, various artists could have beat him in a 'rap battle' such as Canibus, and probably a good number of unknown south african rappers.
