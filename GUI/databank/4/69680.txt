xeus
A hacker who appeared in 1997-2004. Known to hack websites, online games, and personal computers. He had a short temper, and he did not take a second to think about the consequences. There are rumors he was arrested, and rumors he stopped hacking. Nobody knows for sure. There are still impersonators, but none of them has his skills. There are rumors he changed his nick name to Killer or Xeusillius, and appeared some time ago, hacking a person who was playing Warcraft 3. There are also rumors not only was he good at hacking, but he was good at playing games, making designs, and writing (he, however, sucked at programming so much he couldn't make a trainer on his own). ; Some say he was a leecher. But I say their opinion is biased, since I saw my best friend killing him in WoW some time ago, and his computer was fried. It would say on the screen 'Xeus owns me' whenever he turns it on. He could have leeched that virus from somewhere, but a virus that says 'Xeus owns me'? I think not. Also, his account was empty, and Xeus had his items. ; Some people say he's a noob full of lies. I think not. I've heard of plenty of people who got hacked by him. To name one, T Man, a gosu CS player, whom Xeus accused of using aimbot, was never seen again. ; There are records showing that he was a admin at quite a few hacking sites, which none of them exist now, because they were either taken over by the government, or they were closed down by Xeus in order to save himself lawsuits. ; Xeus is an irate internet pirate.
