California Knockout
\'The so-called \'California Knockout,\' a person holds his breath for 10 seconds to get light-headed, after which a pal squeezes his neck to put him out (unconscious).\' ; It\'s some kind of wacky \'trip\' or \'high\' inducing maneuver. Commonly practiced by stupid teenagers. It kills brain cells.
