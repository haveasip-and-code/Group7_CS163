Peapod Girl
A follower of the teachings and philosophies of that legendary cook and gourmand, Ma Pee-Pod. (note the different spelling of these homophones). A 'Peapod Girl' is actually the singular version of 'Peapod Girls', which is more accurate, since 'They' only come as a brace of Pod, aka Twinz.
