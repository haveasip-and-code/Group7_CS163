The Academy of Notre Dame
Why don't we all get past the Villa-ND rivalry and realize that besides our different uniforms we basically all go to the same school....all girls, Catholic, each populated by a relatively equal amount of pretty girls, ugly girls, sluts, prudes, bitches and nice people. Even though I go to Notre Dame, some of my best friends go to Villa and they are the coolest people. It's so immature how all these people act like one is better than the other and use the same 'fat, ugly whores' insults to put each other down...neither side is being classy or original.
