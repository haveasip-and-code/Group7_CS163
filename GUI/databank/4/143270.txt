prefix opiate
Any [opiate] with the prefix oxy, hydro, etc in front of the name. Valuable because of the fact that they are not metabolized into [morphine] which makes the standard drug tests test for morphine in the urine. They can however be detected by extended drug tests if opiate use is suspected.
