AKA: You Just Got Served. ; The gayest saying started due to the release of a very lame movie. Most of the lameass people on the internet use it because they think that it is a cool thing to say, when really its one of the most annoying and lame sayings I've ever heard. If you ever stoop low enough to say this, I suggest you go buy yourself a pistol and shoot yourself now please. Thank you.
