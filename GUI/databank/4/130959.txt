Houston Astros
The baddest team in the 05 National League proved once and for all that it doesn't matter what you did or didn't do in the early season or in 44 seasons past. The fair weather fans who dis the Astros year after year - because they 'know' the team will choke - are 10x bigger losers than this club ever was. Houston, we have a pennant!
