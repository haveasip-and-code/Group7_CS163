sugar rush
1. The title of a novel written by Julie Burchill, perhaps better known by it's TV adaptation. ; The TV series is based strongly upon the novel - exploring the life of 15 year old Kim (Olivia Hallinan) and her lustful obsession with the gorgeous Maria Sweet, aka. 'Sugar' (Lenora Crichlow). ; The show, set in Brighton, explores just some of the dilemnas faced by many people in their teenage years. Kim's sexuality remains bottled up inside her, she feels the need to lose her virginity and her family is very much in domestic unrest, with numerous socially problematic issues, particularily regarding Kim's rather strange brother. ; The show also focuses upon the relationship Kim has with her adulterous mother, Stella. ; It is suggested that the show's popularity may be as a result of it being in some way titillating to the (predominantly) male viewers, which has led to accusations of the show being nothing more than 'mindless seuxal filth'. ; Undoubtebly, there are men somewhat aroused by the forbidden lesbian love, and hence will be consisently fixated on the events which unravel on screen. ; However the show's appeal is not simply to the male population, as everyone can probably relate in some way to at least some of the issues the show deals with. ; The show remains entertaining, with, at times, intelligent and original dialogue and character interaction. Kim's monologues are particularily good. Elements of humour also mix nicely. ; 2. The strong, and quite often sudden desire to either begin, or perpetuate the ingestion of sugary products, such as candy, cakes and ice creams, in a hedonistic nature.
