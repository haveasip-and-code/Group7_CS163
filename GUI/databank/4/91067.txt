H1
The Hummer H1, made by General Motors-owned Hummer, is a civilian version of the AM General HMMWV (Humvee). It was released in the 1990's and became popular due to its look and amazing off-road capabilities. Being based on a military vehicle, it was very tough and strong. It was originally called Hummer until Hummer made the Hummer [H2], then it became the H1. ; In 2005, Hummer made the H1 Alpha, which gives the H1 a better engine and interior. The Alpha upgrade will soon be on all Hummer vehicles. ; Sadly, most people that own Hummer H1s do not use them for their purpose: off-roading. Most use them for transport like SUVs such as the Ford Expedition. This is frivolous, as the Hummer H1 costs 120,000 USD because it excels in off-roading, not in space. For this purpose, one should buy the Hummer H2, Ford Expedition, Chevrolet Suburban, or Honda Odyssey Touring, or even the BMW 760Li.
