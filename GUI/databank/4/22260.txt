Hipster Dufus
A word whose origins come from the hit television sitcom 'Seinfeld'. One of the recurring characters, Cosmo Kramer, had been called this (as far as I know, on more than one occasion). ; I assume it's supposed to be an insult, referring to the person as someone who thinks they're cool, yet is (according to the insulter) quite the opposite.
