Just a Friend
A kind phrase that is said to end a relationship with another person. However, that person doesn't actually intend to become friends with the person he or she is breaking up with. Another way of perceiving this phrase is: 'I'll talk to you today, but I don't intend to see or talk to you ever again.'
