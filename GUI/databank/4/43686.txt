grime
An aggressive and largely unintelligable sub-genre of Garage eminating from Inner City London, first spearheaded by the likes of 'Roll Deep' and 'Dizzy Rascal'. With incredibly annodyne backdrops and moronic lyrics, the average grime track is little more than a ranting semi-intelligable tirade about council estates, guns, and how 'from road' the MC is. Utter tripe.
