brugmansia
Brugmansia is a plant that grows fairly tall, and is often mistaken as [datura]. Brugmansia is better known as angel's trumpet. Brugmansia contains several chemicals in its flowers that cause intoxication similar, yet different from Datura. The hallucinations from Brugmansia usually last some 12 hours but you can still feel a strong buzz the next day. Brugmansia is similar to [Datura] and can be smoked, eaten or be made into a drink.
