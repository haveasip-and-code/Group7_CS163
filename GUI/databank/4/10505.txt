heatwave
The ancient process of removing the contents of a backpack, turning the bag inside out, re-filling it with its contents, then waiting to watch the expression of confusion/disbelief on the bag-owner's face when they see what some loser did to their bag. However, it is thoroughly amusing. ; The term was derived by the appearance of a 'heatwaved' bag, which looks like a Dominos Pizza delivery bag. ; Made famous by the [thayer academy] class of '07, particularly Artie and Slider.
