Opposition Defiant Disorder
A 'disorder' found in kids (mostly). Here are the symptoms: ; # often loses temper ; # often argues with adults ; # often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules ; # often deliberately annoys people ; # often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior ; # is often touchy or easily annoyed by others ; # is often angry and resentful ; # is often spiteful or vindictive ; Pft! It's not a disorder, just bad parenting.
