Ninja Gaiden
Ninja Gaiden is the long-running [Tecmo] action series of video games. Originating as an arcade brawler, the series' most notable titles on home consoles are the three titles for the [Nintendo Entertainment System] and the recent [Xbox] title (and its rerelease titled '[Ninja Gaiden Black]'), which was the first Ninja Gaiden title in over a decade. ; The last title especially is a particularly awesome game, the kind of game that isn't afraid to kick your ass (but without cheating you, because cheating is for wimps and commies). It's the type of game that the disgraceful '[casual gamer]' will give up on because it's '[too hard],' but anyone with the proper combination of brains and balls can't get enough of such an awesome game. In fact, if the term '[too hard]' exists in your vocabulary, you have no brains nor balls.
