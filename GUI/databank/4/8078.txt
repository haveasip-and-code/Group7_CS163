glomar response
A response that neither confirms nor denies the existence or nonexistence. ; My source is ; DOD regulation 5400.7 paragraphs C3.2.1.6.5 and C3.2.1.7.1.3.1 These paragraphs have to do with the freedom of information act (FOIA). It is a method of denying information considered exempt by the act. ; The first time was used was a response from the CIA to a FOIA request. It was dealing with the Glomar Explorer, a ship supposedly built to recover a sunken russian sub. That is how it got its name.
