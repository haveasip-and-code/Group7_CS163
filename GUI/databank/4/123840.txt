eraserhead
Eraserhead is the most disturbing, warped, and surreal films possibly ever made. The movie is very well made, good acting, incredible cinematography and special effects (i.e. the baby) so well done it will make your skin crawl as you wonder 'Is that thing real?' The baby is so hideous, it's slight off pitch cry is the only thing that is even remotely human about it.Would I recommend this movie? It depends. To most, I would strongy encourage them NOT to watch, it's too bizarre, it's too weird. But then, to some who can take it, I would highly recommend it. In terms of bizarreness, Pi is the only other movie that even comes close, but even that looks like Mr. Rogers Neighborhood in comparison to Eraserhead.
