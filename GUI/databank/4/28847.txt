Pet Is Birth
A common catch-cry of college students across New Zealand. It is used when there is nothing else to say in the class-room environment eg, akward silence or just the chance to just get attention. ; It's origins are largely unknown but it is suggested that it started in the year 10 KingsWay School Drama class in the year 2004. ; 'Pet Is birth' is a classic example of a random concept that never died down. It spread like wildfire it maybe one day it will be written down in the annals of time itself.
