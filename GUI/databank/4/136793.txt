chair ride
A New England thing when you are expecting to go on a hay ride around a golf course but it's really just two horses pulling people that are sitting on chairs on a wagon and listening to some corny guy hired to sing about 1812 and some old lady trying to be cool and sing too when she actually sucks at life.
