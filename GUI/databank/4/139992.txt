Roseanne
A show for the proletariat. Follows the trials and tribulations of a low class family in Lanford, Illinois. Family members include Roseanne Conner, the titular main character and overweight house wife who attempts to make ends meet with minimum wage jobs. Dan Conner, played by the masterful John Goodman, is the overweight father, who goes through various states of employment and unemployment and, while relying on Roseanne's jobs to keep food on the table, seems almost emasculated. To make up for this, Dan is often seen tinkering with cars or motorcycles, maintaining a sense of 'manliness' through his castration. ; Secondary characters include DJ, the youngest child of the family and only boy offspring. He is used often as comic relief, but in later years, is used to appeal to the indie moviegoers of the late 90's. Darlene, the middle child, is a gawky teenager in the early years of the show, but is changed to a brooding, almost gothic character in the later years. Becky rounds out the trio of children, and shows how a smart girl is changed by a 'bad boy', Mark Healy, Becky's boyfriend and later husband, who is a stereotypical greaser. Mark's brother, David, is Darlene's booksmart, effeminate boyfriend and later husband. ; The story of each episode related to the poverty of the family, growing up poor, or living with parents in which the gender roles are reversed. In the last seasons, the family begins to live with the dangers of extreme wealth after winning the lottery, including adultery and strangely, lesbianism. ; The first season dvd was released in the summer of 2005.
