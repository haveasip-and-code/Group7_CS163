Vogel Squat
Inspired by Steven Vogel, a term used in weight-training to describe the motion, or rather, lack of motion in the squat lift. Starting at an angle of 180 degree angle from feet to ass, the Vogel squatter proceeds to bend his knees to form a 177.2 degee angle in a spastic, nearly unnoticeable motion. The Vogel squatter also emits a loud yell to assure that everyone is watching his awful lift.
