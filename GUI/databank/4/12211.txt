slopfest
(n.) ; 1.) a girl who gets so severely intoxicated at a party that despite how good looking she may be, her rambling and overt slutish behavior turn her off to everyone (sometimes can be used toward a male, but that can be risky) ; 2.) a party that is either one of epic proportion or spans more than two consecutive days (the latter party mainly occurs with large groups of hippies)
