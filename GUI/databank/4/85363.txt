Hmoob
'Hmoob' refers to the language of the [Hmong] people of Asia, and the word is actually pronounced more like 'Hmong.' ; The 'b' in the word modifies the tone of the preceeding 'oo' (much like accent marks modify the tone of vowels in French). ; The traditional home of the [Hmong] ethnic group is in the mountains of Laos as well as parts of China and Vietnam; there is also a large immigrant community in the United States.
