Silly little battles started by script-kiddies and is always started by: Micro$0ft sukz 4eva, linux is s0oo0o0 much better, oh yeah apple users are loserzzz. ; Then someone comes on with knowledge of computers: ; Actually if windows is so bad, how come its the most popular of them all. ; Look people, in the past I have had or worked on apple lisa, windows 3.1, windows 95, 98, 2000, XP, red-hat linux and solaris so freaking calm down, go read a book, then come back and talk properly. ; Script-kiddies suck.
