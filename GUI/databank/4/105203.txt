The Big Lebowski
The greatest movie in history, made by the brilliant Coen Brothers. Anyone who has not seen this movie is utterly worthless. Anyone who has seen it and disliked it should be ripped off the face of the Earth. In the film, Jeff Bridges plays Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski, whose rug is peed on. Somehow, this gets him involved in a hostage situation, and an overly complex world of corruption and lies. Hilarity ensues.
