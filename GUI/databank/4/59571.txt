Green Beer Day
A Holiday created at [Miami University] (OH) b/c the school scheduled spring break over St. Pattys. It takes place every year the Thursday before Spring Break and is celebrated by bars opening at 5:30 am and students drinking Green Beer all day while still going to classes. Teachers try to stop this by scheduling exams but the students realize the Green Beer Day is more important and just show up drunk. ; To show support of the day students wear t-shirts made for the day, green and gold mardi gras beads and often have mouths dyed green because of the amount of beer they have consumed.
