jewtheran
a new and upcoming religion based on the teachings of anything that people want to believe (except neo con bullshit). all thoughts as philosophys culminated into one simple religion. niether jewish or lutheran in founding, the jewtheran faith was established in 1874 by McAab Jemasoon. since its founding all forms of scientific and philisophical ideals have been added to include quite simple, everything. that is right; in perspective to who the hell ever.
