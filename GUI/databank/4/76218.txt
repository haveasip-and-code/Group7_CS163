Towson
When describing Towson anyone who lives here knows that you can't leave out the surrounding upper class suburbs of Hunt Valley, Ruxton, Timonium and sometimes Jacksonville (see jville) that feed into the Towson scene. The kids are rich, pretty, smart and the best at their sport, spending most of their time toking on a joint in a friends 70,000$ car or playing ruit in someones basement. The parties are always huge, and no matter how fun it was it will always seem awesome because everybody was too drunk to remember. Lacrosse is THE sport, if you dont play it you play something else and you still love it. If you don't go to private school, its probably not because mommy and daddy cant pay for it but because you wish to have constant interaction with the opposite sex making it easier to be a slut during your high school years. Usually this is done at Dulaney, because Towson and Loch Raven just SUCK. Once you leave, you miss the hell out of it and always come back just so you can raise your own kids in the same unsupervised, spoiled manner your parents did.
