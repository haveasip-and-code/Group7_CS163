giesch
The act of giesching is a time honored tradition and should only be conducted by specialists. Dr. Ryan Hedden and Proffesor Brian Cronin are both some of the most experienced gieschers and have written many books on the subject. Giesch Awareness Day will be held to raise money for people who have been mis-giesched for counseling. It will also be held to aware people of the practice. Giesching seminars will be held at Laguna Beach High School.
