grout
Defined on here as an amusing bathroom-graffiti phenomenon. This same exact phenomenon was prominent in two high-traffic public mens' restrooms at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in the mid-1990's. It included also 'The Grout Beyond', 'Grout-o Marks', 'The Grout Space Coaster,' etc. ; I'm not sure where it originated... I post it here because it's a second place in a different time, and it would be interesting to try to trace its origin.
