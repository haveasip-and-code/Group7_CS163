Crush
A crush is the most painful thing you could ever endure in your life other than someone breaking your heart...Oh wait, theyre the same thing. If you want to hurt, just have a crush on someone. Especially if your best friend is one of the prettiest girls in the school! You have to live with that. If you ever take the risk of having your crush find out that you like him, be prepared for the consequences. Him not liking you, him embarrasing you forever, and him liking your best friend. It hurts so much, and it will be hard for you to like new people forever, just because of one guy, one time. Good luck. I dont wish this punishment on anyone, because it hurts so bad, and I can never come back from it, but I still care about him, always. Dont hit me:(
