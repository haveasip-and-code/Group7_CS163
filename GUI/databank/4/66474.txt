Selfosophy
The tax-exempt belief system, also involved its own theology. But I can't tell you what it is -- it's a secret. When learning the theologies, Selfosophists must undergo a sworn blood oath ritual, which is also a secret. ; An excommunicated member is called a 'Ratfinkovich.' ; Selfosophy books include: 'How to Be Happy, Even When You Shouldn't.', 'How to Manipulate People by Your Apparent Friendliness' and 'How to Overcome Your Fears by Making Others Fear You'.
