HQ
other than its shortness for 'headquarters', he is a legend that ruled the streets of D-Ville, Georgia. The tale states that he earned a degree in pimpology within months and is now the head professor of Pimp University. Occasionally called, Dr. Pimp, his raw talent in pimping, HQ was soon known as 'High Quality'. Researchers believe that being a native New Zealander must have a tremendous effect on HQ, making him the 'Austin Powers' of the 21st century, but without the mojo.
