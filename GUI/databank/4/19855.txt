blanket welding
Derived from the process of sheet welding (i.e. sticking two sheets together), refers to bed-based masturbatory activities, with the assumed consequence that the 'sheets' (substituted for 'blankets' for increased differentiation from the innocent metal-work activity), will be welded (i.e. stuck together with semen) together.
