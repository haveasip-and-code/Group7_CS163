Blaise Zabini
Blaise Zabini is a character in Harry Potter that isn't mention in the Harry Potter books a lot but his name is in there...so look you lazy bastards. He was at first said to be a girl but he was affirmed to being a boy by her highness, Rowling herself. In fanfiction, a lot of people put Zabini as Draco's boyfriend or for some people who still like the idea fo him being a girl, his girlfriend. What he looks like is unknown also and so is his sexuality but many people lile to compare him to Harry Potter.
