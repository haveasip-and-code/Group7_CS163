Terry Tate
The brilliant character created by Reebok's marketing staff. Hired into a major corporation, his job is to improve office productivity by means of tackling the shit out of any whiny cracker who thinks he's too good to refill the coffee pot, handle his own K-22 paper jams, or throw the soda can into the proper recycling bin.
