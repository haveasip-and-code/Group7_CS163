Japanese cars
the EPITOME (wtf is an opitime ya retard) of a well-rounded car that has enough performance for the average driver and the capabilities to become a high-performance vehicle for car enthusiasts. a car that operates perfectly fine without requiring one to deplete his or her bank account to fill up a gas tank. a car that, with the CORRECT modifications, will compete with and hold its own against any [american muscle] car. a car that doesn't pour out gallons and gallons of smog and pollution. a car that is safe, reliable, durable, and will not break down after 100,000 miles.
