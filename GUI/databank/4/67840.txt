Binghamton
An industrial wasteland where parents send their spolied Long Island Kids to get a NYU comparable education, but the kids are too fucking bratty to accept anything other than going to Boston University and having their balls powdered while their new BMW's get a new pair of rims. Oh, and the cloudy weather makes everyone insane. Smoke weed everyday.
