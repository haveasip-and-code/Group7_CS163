frunk
Frunk (adj.)- the state of being partially or completely retarded due to excessive drinking or hanging out with G and D. Sometimes associated with too much laughing. Originally thought to be combination of the phrase 'F***ing drunk' because frankly, it is much easier to say frunk than f***ing drunk when you are frunk.
