Fratelli
A trio of a mother and two of her sons who tried to steal pirate One-Eyed Willy's treasure but were foiled by a group of kids and her outcast son, Sloth. They enjoy serving yellowish brown water to kids at closed down restaurants, and showing up for 4x4 beach races unannounced and unregistered.
