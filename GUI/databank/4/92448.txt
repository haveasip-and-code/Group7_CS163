willingworth
Noun. A person who is likely to attract the attention of the gay community due to his dress sense or the fact that he is wearing a hat in the shape of a red rooster. This person is insecure about their sexuality and so frequently feels the urge to do something about it by beating up his little brother in front of his friends. NB if the full term 'William Illingworth' is used, it indicates that this person has a website dedicated to them on the internet.
