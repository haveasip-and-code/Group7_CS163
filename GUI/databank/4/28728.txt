bunson
1. money, cash, of monetary value. ; 2. really super awesome, [money]. ; Traces back to the late 1400's when James Sharp invented the first kerosene stove. Before going out to the pub one night, Sharp's drinking buddy realized he was short on cash. Looking to the new kerosene stove for a slang term for money, he realized that the turning the dial to turn on the bunson burner very closely resembled the universal sign for money.
