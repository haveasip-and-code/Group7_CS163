bitch maid
Noun. Used in name calling/Taunting. ; Additive to the common insult 'bitch'. This variation is mostly used in a half hearted teasing way among friends (not unlike calling a pal and 'asshole ' or a 'cocksucker' but not having hostility or intent to provoke a fight or hard feelings come from it) I have not heard it used when addressing a woman. It does not hold the same force of offense as just the root 'bitch' does.
