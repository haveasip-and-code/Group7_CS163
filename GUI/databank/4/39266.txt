Arguably the best movie ever made. Written and directed by the creator of Beavis and Butthead - Mike Judge. The main character, Peter Gibbons, played by Ron Livingston, hates his repetitive, monotonous job working in Initech with his buddies [Samir Naheenanajad] and [Michael Bolton]. Fed up with his job, Peter decides to see an occpational hypnotherapist who helps him to relax by hypnotising him into temporarily not caring, however he dies before taking the hypnosis off of Peter, leaving him in a relaxed, care-free state of mind which makes for a hilarious movie. ; The funniest characters in the movie are definitely Initech's software Engineers Samir and Michael, both of which who also dislike their jobs, and plan to program a virus to rip Initech off for thousands of dollars. Samir dislikes the workers for being unable to pronounce his last name, and Michael dislikes them for constantly referring to the Singer Michael Bolton, whom he hates but pretends to like in order to fit in with them and make them happy. ; If you have not seen the movie, I Highly Recommend it.
