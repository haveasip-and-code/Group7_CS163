Dirty South
The real dirty south not the bull that everyone else has said is only 4 states. These 4 states and these 4 states only include FLORIDA, GEORGIA, MISSISSIPPI and ALABAMA. No other states are considered the dirty south. If you think so it must be because you live there and don't want to be considered the north, east or Midwest etc.. ; Again the ONLY states that are in reality considered the dirty south are: ; FLORIDA=DIRTY SOUTH ; GEORGIA=DIRTYSOUTH ; MISSISSIPPI=DIRTY SOUTH ; ALABAMA=DIRTY SOUTH ; Other states that try to claim but are in fact part of some other crap and not part of the dirty south are: ; TEXAS=MIDWEST ; TENN=GARBAGE NORTH ; CAROLINAS=NORTH EAST ; ANY OTHER STATE=GARBAGE
