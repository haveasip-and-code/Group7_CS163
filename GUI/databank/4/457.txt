gangsta
Most Real and True 'gangstas' dont use ebonics. They dress sharp and well edjucated on whats going on and there surroundings... U got 'thug' and 'gangsta' mixed up with each other. There 2 totally different things.If you weren't so ignorant then you would know.Al Capone equals a true OG! Tony Soprano equals gangsta. John Gotti, all the families and all the first Dons. You Know! You got to be well edjucated on this stuff. This generation is slowly slipping and so is the edjucation. For some reason though every one wants to be a gangsta, but yet they dont know what it is too be a gangsta. (:
