etnies
To those stupid fucktards out there that think Etnies are only worn by posers, you're completey wrong. if only posers wore Etnies, then you would actually be calling real skaters like Bucky Lasek, Arto Saari (who by the way designed an Etnies shoe) POSERS. I'm not saying that Etnies are the only shoies they wear. And besides, to those guys that say 'Oh! well I only bought them because nobody in school had them!' qouth chickenpantspooper Mar 5, 2005.If you actually spent more than 60 bucks on a pair of shoes that you obviously didn't like whatsoever, then you must have a brain smaller than a fucking peanut. And don't say 'Hey fuck you! I bought them for 20 bucks!', because the cheapest fucking Etnies are at least 60 FUCKING dollars. =] OK? ; Besides, they actually are like the most comfortable shoes on the planet. It's like walking in clouds.So >_< ,,l,, to all those people out there that think Etnies are an illness. My job here is done.
