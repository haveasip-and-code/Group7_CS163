Desert Man
That guy from a girl's past that she will always go back to no matter what. No matter how badly he treated her, how badly it finished or how nice a guy you are, chicks always always go back to Desert Man. ; Desert Man tends to appear in a bar when you're just about to score or in other inopportune situations like your wedding day. ; Named after the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon dude who steals the girls comb, rides off into the desert and then kidnaps and fucks her. Chicks dig that shit.
