Dora The Explorer
A young mexican (or the like) girl who has ODed on on shrooms, 'cause she is always seen singing to inanimate objects, such as, her backpack and a map. Also, the subject of bestiality and Dora often comes up because of her questionable relationship with a purple monkey named [Boots], that wears red boots on his feet. It is also questionable, the whole thing with '[Swiper]' the fox, she always wards him away. He doesn't really do anything, except throw things. Perhaps he was an ex of the appearing four-year-old.
