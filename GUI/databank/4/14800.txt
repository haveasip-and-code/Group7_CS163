Piss Water
Cheap beer that contains very little alcohol. In the 70s 3.2 beer had this title, but since the national 21 year old drinkiing age it has been difficult to obtain. Now piss water is usually shitty beers like [nattie ice] and [busch]. Stupid college kids drink these beers. Don't be those kids.
