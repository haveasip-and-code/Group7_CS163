Red Stater
A real man or woman; a true [American] [patriot]. Contrary to popular [liberal] belief, Red Staters (aka [Republicans]) are actually more open-minded and tolerant of things than they are given credit for. To begin, the overwhelming majority of them are NOT racist. There are tons of [Democrats] who are racist, however. (Keep this in mind, it was Democrats in the past who promoted mistreatment of black people, and wanted to keep slavery alive. There are many white democrats today who still despise blacks. Yes, it is TRUE.) ; Next, we believe in women's rights. We believe that women have every right to leave the home, get a college degree, become successful and get a job, etc. To say otherwise about our stand on women's rights is BULLSHIT. Also, Red Staters (or Republicans) do NOT go around committing hate crimes on racial minorities, [homo]s, lesbians, or non-Christians. (Just so you know, I have fellow devoutly-Republican friends who are ATHEISTS!!! AND, I don't criticize them for it, either.) You people fail to realize that there are millions of Republicans who are actually racial minorities. These include asians, [Native American]s, Hispanics, subcontinient Asian Indians, and even a few black people. There are also Jewish Republicans. Yes, there are; there is plenty of evidence to support the fact that there are people of every single one of those previously-mentioned groups within the Republican Party.
