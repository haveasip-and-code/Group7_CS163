pischer
the stated definition is far too limited and therefore somewhat mis-leading. ; 'pischer' refers to the penis of a young boy and can be used as an insult or as a term of endearment, depending on context. The youngest (pre-pubescent)son in a family might be referred to as the 'pischer,' as may a boy who tries to seem older than his years (i.e., to wish for an adult's penis). ; Whereas one might use [schmuck] as a Yiddish equivalent for 'prick,' 'pischer,' when meant as an insult, designates someone who is a phony or small-fry, one who lacks the power or indepedence he pretends to have.
