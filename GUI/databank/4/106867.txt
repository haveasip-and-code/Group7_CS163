Kie
A hybrid Harry Potter/Spammer. Typically spotted on gaming forums, they are also referred to as 'Useless Cumstains'. For the most part they hang around posting useless one liners, such as 'Lol' and 'Owned' to try and increase their post count, but they are also capable of extreme cases of stupidity, which often results in several other forum members beating him into submission.
