Bad Religion
Like just about everyone else has said... the best Punk Band ever. Hell, forget labels. One of the best Bands ever. All those poser bands coming out now-a-days don't even compare and it makes me sick how little recognition Bad Religion gets. Known for their inspirational and political lyrics, Bad Relgion is the r0x0r.
