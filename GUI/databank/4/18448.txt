JJ Redick
JJ Redick is the best basketball player ever who happens to be a great poetry writer as well. The best 3 point shooter and free throw shooter. He has broken an NCAA record for his amazing free throw shooting. And is also very good looking. Everyone is jealous of him because they want to be him.
