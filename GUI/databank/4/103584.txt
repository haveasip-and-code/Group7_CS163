IPS
1. Intrepid Posting Syndicate - In 2004 a crack message board posting unit was banned by a overzealous admin for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from the SOE boards to the OG underground. Today still wanted by the admins, they survive as posters of fortune. If you have a problem. If no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire, The IPS Team.
