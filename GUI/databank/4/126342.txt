plate
A section of the crust of the earth, which is cracked. Each plate moves slowly over a very viscous [thick] liquid called the mantle, which itself covers a liquid metal core and solid inner core, mostly made of iron and nickle. These plates are called 'tectonic' plates. These types of plates may make contact with each other in various ways to cause earthquakes and form volcanoes, trenches and mountains.
