Nightwish
One of the greatest bands in the world, featuring one of the greatest singers in the world, Tarja Turunen. They prove that you don't have to use the word 'pain' in every other song in order to write lyrics, that girl singers (and rock singers in general) do not have to whine, and that talented musicians can and do show off their skill playing in metal bands. Oh, and they also used the same orchestra from the Lord of the Rings soundtrack on their album 'Once'.
