Black Apocalypse
The greatest [Gangsta Metal] Band on Earth! Formed in 1991 by ex-rappers who found rap to be getting stale. Although I disagree, they formed the only good [subgenre] of [metal] which [lyrics] people can relate to instead of 'I love [Satan], he makes me hard, RAAWWWRRRGGG' ; '[N][i][g][g][a][z] [N][e][v][a] [D][i][e]' is da best song eva! Forget [Stairway to Heaven] or any of that white boy shit. It has da best guitar solo and da phatest drum work eva and da lyrics are beautiful. ; 'We are real, you whities are fake like your women's titties / I see white kids dressing like us like day dealt wit' da shitty and every bitty ditty wit' da itty bitty pity / Day can't dress black / dey don't know black / dey ain't not dealt wit' da persacution like us / Us black folk our proud of our hertiage and we don't act white / Day think they know street but have never even seen a fight.' ; Da line up hasn't changed since it's creation because all these brothas are like family. ; Line-Up ; Ballin' Freestyle - Vocals ; 4:MM:0 Loaded - Guitar ; Twistin' Psycho 666 - Drums ; Crush - Bassist
