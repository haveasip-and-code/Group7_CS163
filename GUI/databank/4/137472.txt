uberloser
An almost oxymoron that is curiously comprised of someone who is both Uber and Loser. ; '[Uber]' is derived from [Nietzsche]'s term '[ubermensch]' meaning 'superman.' [Loser] is plain out english, meaning 'someone who fails to succeed.' ; Therefore, an UberLoser is both superior and inferior.
