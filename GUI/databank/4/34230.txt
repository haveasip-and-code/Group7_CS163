in john greggs tent
Refers to Mike Gregg beating off in John Greggs tent at a Boy scout camp out. It can also be sung to the tune of 'pomp and curcumstance'. The lyrics are as follows 'Mike Gregg tosses salad over pictures of stuff in John Greggs tent, while looking for aarons knife but it was a lie so that he could beat it five times in a day' (Any Mac users copy the lyrics into simple text and set the voice to 'good news'. It is very funny.
