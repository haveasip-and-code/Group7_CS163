Hollister Co.
Hollister Co. is just like Abercrombie & Fitch but a some what cheaper price. It's really for people who are some what popular and preppy. In other words like me. People who talk down about this clothing store are just insecure about themselves and trying to find a reason to be mean. Goths mostly. But I don't care what anybody says about Hollister Co., Abercrombie & Fitch, and American Eagle are the best stores!!!
