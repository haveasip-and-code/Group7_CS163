Movie Faramir
David Wenham's character portrayal of Tolkein's Faramir in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson. Movie Faramir is a bit darker than the Faramir in the Lord of the Rings books, but is more complex and ends up releasing the ring and Frodo anyways. He is often considered 'really hot'.
