Jackson NJ
Jackson- known for Great Adventure and if you didnt live in Jackson your whole life then you know it as Six Flags. Its the place that you can be considered a Hick but at the same time be told you live in a city. You have to go to other towns to actually go to stores. One side of Jackson is woods and the other is built up. Schools are known to be over-crowded and filled with a diverse group. People move here because they like the woods but then they build it up to what they just left. ; Anyone who is a true J-towner knows that there is always a PaRtY to go to, you know that Jackson is thought as this wonderful town that the kids are 'innocent'. Here is where you laugh it up. You know the deal-woods, parties,drinking...etc...there's nothing else to do. so fill that glass and cheers to the true J-towners that prove to every1 what a good time really is.
