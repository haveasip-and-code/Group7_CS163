Generation Y
Generation Y is harder to define. The only reason for that is that we are still involved in it and therefore still doing research. (By the way, whenever I say, 'we,' I mean we. Me and my friends have spent long hours thinking through all this stuff.) ; Generation Y started fresh off the crash/burn of Generation X; a kind of rise from the ashes. Generation Y involved anyone who attended/completed high school between 1997 and now. Most of those heavily involved in GenY have had an older sibling heavily involved in GenX. GenY has suffered a divide, unlike our predecessors, in that few groups of people ever come together against something. Associations are limited. There is an abundance of us, however. Our younger siblings may end up being a Generation Z, but that remains to be seen. ; Generation Y still have competition from a second wave of Gen-Xers. The new Gen-Xers are in typical fashion of days of yore, but with contemporary styles. Generation Y pervades this, but all in all lives alongside it. Generation Y kids tend to be more vocal about things, but usually do less. ; Drug use is still rampant, that's for sure. ; More will be added as research is developed. Bear with us.
