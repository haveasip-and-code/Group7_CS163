Saskatoon
1. Where nice people live as well as some fuckers ; 2. Where you don't want to stay alone after midnight when you miss the last bus in winter ; 3. Where shit includes with 13%taxes, be poor and proud with that! ; 4. Where temperature fuck up and down different 100 degree in both winter and summer ; 5. Where you think 'What the fuck is that? Is this Saskatoon?' on the plane when you see a totally flatted plain down there with less constuctions. ; 6. Where to be there like a Santa and get back home like you have never been there ; 7. Where little boys stay home when it hits -30, and grown men go fishing and dancing outside no shirts! ; 8. Where is a good place to study despite one part of the university's name and how the people make fun of it ; 9. Where to get fresh air, cold water (really damn great and free!), and hot chicks! ; 10. Where we call, A dead peacful city ; 11. Avril Lavigne has been there even she's not Saskatoonian ; 12. Same as Celine Dion ; 13. Where guys sucks at pool
