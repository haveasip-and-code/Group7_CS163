Fat Stop
A largely overweight man who thinks he is king of everything who 'guards' the parking lot at high schools. He thinks he is a policeman and tries to chase students around who he thinks are breaking the rules; hated by students. He drives a golf cart around campus, which leans lovingly to one side as he polices the area.
