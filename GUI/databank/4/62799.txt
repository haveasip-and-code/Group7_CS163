James Mclaren
Known by many as 'The Lucky Irishman' or quite simply 'Macca'. A man usually found in Adelaide close by his car - the Big Red machine. He is fun(ny) guy when sober and enjoys activities such as [brown hurricane] and the like when 'chemically inconvienienced' (drunk). ; There are many look-a-likes and sound-a-likes of Macca, but the true James Mclaren can be recognised by his distinguishable red hair (:P) and unique laugh
