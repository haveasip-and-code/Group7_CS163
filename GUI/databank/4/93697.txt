scene kid
A scene kid, or a 'scenster,' generally refers to someone who defines their personality by how many cordinates (usually very tight) they can wear at once, while maintaining an equally hip side part, and maybe even a side lip ring to off center. Scene kids usually listen to obscure bands and are always seen at social gatherings where they can show off their attire to their peers. ; The only difference between scene kids and hipsters is hipsters are ass holes about grammer and punctuation. Hipsters are very quick to leave a spelling error corrections whenever a mistake is made, even if the comment is completely irrelevant to the post.
