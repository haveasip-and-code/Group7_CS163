jabitzer
A pool (pocket billiards) term. The foul committed when the cue ball is struck twice. Specifically when that first little touch is followed by a reflexive jab at the cue ball. This is a portmanteau word that is, a word carrying two meanings. The stroke is a jabitzer; the cueist is also a jabitzer.
