Fudgemonkey
A substitute for the word 'Fuck','Shit', or 'Damn'. You can say this anywhere except for at or near a very prim and proper english person.Or your stuck up parents who might punish you from going to the next BIG BEST THING.If you're trying to stop cussing as much or can't cuss where you are at that moment,you can use this word.
