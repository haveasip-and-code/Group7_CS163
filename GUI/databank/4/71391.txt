Evidently, Americans need to keep a dictionary handy at all times because apparently they don't know that the word P-E-D-O-P-H-I-L-E is. With all the crap going on with the Catholic church one would think that it would be as easy as pumping gas. But, unfortunately, some of the more estrogen enriched members of our country can't even do that, so perhaps I'm asking too much.
