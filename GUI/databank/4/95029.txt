joppatowne high school
at joppatowne high, 50% of the students are black, 30% are white kids or asians trying to be black, 15% are freaks/'gothic', and 5% are either sluts, or ignored. if you don't listen to rap, you 'aren't cool'. if you don't play a sport, you 'aren't cool'. there is a fight near the cafeteria at least once a week. you can't go a day without hearing someone is talking about you. the creepy kids stay after school and play hackey sack until 4 or 5. you might as well smoke weed, because if you don't, once again you 'aren't cool'. all you hear all day every day is who is doing who and 'i smoked this fat blunt last night'.
