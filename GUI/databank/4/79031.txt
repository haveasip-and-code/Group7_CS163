Admininazi
An administrator of a message board or message forum, who is nothing short of an Internet Hitler. The Admininazi is easy to spot by the ridiculously long, irrational rules they concoct for the users of their message board/forum to respect and follow. ; Admininazis are also very quick to punish users who break the rules, and make examples of them. This usually involved forum restrictions, as well as verbal abuse and obvious public displays of their dislike for said user. Though this bothers other users, they don't dare complain because they know this would get them on the Admininazi's 'shit list'. ; In some cases, the Admininazi will 'rule' over their staff [moderator]s, rather than work with them as a fully functional group. ; An Admininazi is nothing short of a bully, with a computer and an ISP connection. If you run across one, just try to keep in mind that their real lives are probably not very fulfilling, happy, or satisfying. They probably have very little social interaction off of the Internet, and are very pathetic, lonely human beings.
