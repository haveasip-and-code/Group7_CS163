robert johnson
Incredibly talented blues guitarist inspired by Delta blues greats like Son House and Charley Patton. Tremendous influence on 1960s rockers like Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards. While much of his writing may have been borrowed from earlier artists, Johnson was also an outstanding vocalist and guitarist.
