common law
The legal system of countries such as England (not scotland, they have a civil law system), Australia and USA. ; It's a bullshit way to codify what a 2 year old can tell is right or wrong. ; It's supposed to be fluid to modiy with changing society opinions on what is right or wrong. But in fact is full of old cunt judges who are so conservative they still think we should all be living with blacks and women as slaves and servants. ; The judges write huge ass judgments to reason their thoughts out in a ruling which is so circular and wordy that the same thing can be written in 1 page including a picture. ; In criminal law, it works pretty well, but for civil matters, it's the most useless way to get things done. ; If you look at the law of contracts or torts, you can smell the bullshit that goes on from a mile away. ; The common law is not designed to uphold justice but to uphold the sack of gold of the rich. If you've got money, you can't lose - that's read as 'appeal'.
