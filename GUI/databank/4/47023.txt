Eighties era 'heavy metal'. Some bands even continued into the early 90's, while scant others exist today (aerosmith). Fashion items include, but aren't limited to, tight spandex (with or without leopard print), colored boas, leg warmers (over the pants), really tight leather jackets with studs in them, denim galore,etc. Hair was generally teased up with an insane amount of hairspray, known as the metal afro. Members wore copious amounts of makeup lending to a very sassy look. I can't believe this was once considered cool.
