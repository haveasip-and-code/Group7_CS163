southampton
A fucking [shithole] full of [scummers], one of the worst places to live in the UK. They have a shit football team that are currently sitting at the bottom of the [english] premier league. The team is so shit that they had to steal local rivals manager and players. They are so [shit] that they couldn't hold a decent event. This year portsmouth is holding two big international events, one to celebrate the battle of trafalgar and the other is the international vestival of the sea. Southampton can only hold a shitty boat show each year. If you have chance to go to Southampton, don't go there. The only decent thing about Southampton is the option not to go there!!
