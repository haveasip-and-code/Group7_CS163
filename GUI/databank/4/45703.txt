Rice
A shortened way of saying Race Inspired Cosmetic Effects ; A popular among the automotive crowd, Rice describes cars that have been modified visually; be it a very agressive and over-done body kit, rear spoiler (very popular 'rice'), 'Euro'-style or 'Altezza' (clear lens and silver plastic, red lenses - second most popular) tail lights, or a bunch of useless car modifications, including but not limited to: Fake nitrous bottles, Type R stickers, 19' rims, fake hood/body/roof scoops, ground-effects lighting (glow under car), and the infamous fart-can muffler (usually 3 1/2' or more in diamater, identifyable by its annoyingly loud drone, reminiscent of a screwed-up subwoofer or a fart in a can, hence the term fartcan).
