hot pizza
When you go to Little Ceasers and order a 'Hot n' Ready' pizza. Then the guy behind the counter grabs the counter and slowly does a handstand. He then wraps his legs around your head and shits [Diarrhea] all over your head and face. Then when he's done serving you he kindly ask's if you want breadsticks with that
