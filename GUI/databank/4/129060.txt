kwame
On a streetball court, the circle at the center of the court is usually divided into two sections. The inside section is known as the Kwame (Kwame Brown) circle and making a shot from inside this section is worth 5 points. The outer circle is known as the Phil Jackson circle and a shot made from this section is worth 3 points. Making a Kwame shot is usually referred to as a 'Kwame Brown', but there is no strict standard on its usage.
