wellesley
A suburbial town outside of Boston. Frequently stereotyped as a predominantly white, rich, preppy, snobby town, this is true with some of the citizens but NOT ALL OF THEM. Although there aren't many minorities seen walking in Wellesley center, we DONT DISCRIMINATE. And not everyone wears lacoste & juicy and shops at Luisa Luisa or trappings. Some people (actually, a lot of people) wear 'non-preppy' clothes and are genuine and nice people. We don't appreciate the snobby stereotype so please don't label us.
