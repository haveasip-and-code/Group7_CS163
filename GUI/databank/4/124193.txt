coolero
A coolero is a married man whose wife has tricked him into thinking that the child/ren she had birthed while married to him are actually his although they look so unlike him in any way that only a friggin idiot would believe that they are really his. Spawned from Me, Myself and Irene when Jim Carrey's character's wife has three black boys and he never questions the paternity.
