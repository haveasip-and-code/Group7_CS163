bjj
Acronym for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: A grappling martial art developed in Brazil based on Japanese Jiu-Jitsu. The general idea in BJJ is to first secure the best possible position on the ground, and then to choke or lock-out the joint of an opponent, forcing the opponent to submit, pass out, or suffer serious bodily harm. True to its intent, BJJ was made popular in America by an a Brazilian named Royce Gracie who, at only 175#, succeeded in submitting much larger opponents in the eary days of full-contact limited rules competition. Today, BJJ is generally recognized as the most effective form of ground-fighting. BJJ employs no striking techniques, it is practiced wearing a [gi], and it employs a belt system (white, blue, purple, brown, and black). BJJ techniques are often employed to some extent by [MMA] competitors and by wrestlers, judo players, and other grapplers seeking to add submission techniques to their arsenal.
