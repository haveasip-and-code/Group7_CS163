Mozilla Firefox
The internet browser that kicks [Internet Explorer] in the [balls]. It goes faster than Internet Explorer, blocks spyware and viruses unlike IE instead of getting programs that you can use after the use of IE. Mozilla doesn't crash like Opera and then reverts to the last use, and then crashes again and again. MOZILLA FIREFOX KICKS BALLS!
