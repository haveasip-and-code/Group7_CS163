IHTFP
An affectionate acronym used at military academies (US Air Force Academy for one) which originally meant 'I'm Here To Fly Planes' and then came to mean, with time (and lots of cynicism from the dumb shit cadets are made to do), 'I Hate This Fucking Place'... ; And the fucktard who said it was from MIT is just plain stupid...go find the square root of something homo...
