Stick
[Chapman Stick] ; A 10- or 12-stringed fretted instrument in the guitar family. ; The Chapman Stick is a one-piece instrument with no discernible body. The neck is the entire body, therefore it resembles a stick. ; The Chapman Stick is played solely with the [tapping] or [two-handed tapping] or [double-handed tapping] technique, in which each hand plays lines and melodies independently. ; The Chapman Stick has a unique tuning which offers a range extending lower than a bass guitar and to about the same high pitch as an electric guitar.
