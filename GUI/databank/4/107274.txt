maus
One of the biggest tanks ever built. Only two prototypes of the superheavy tank were ever produced in 1944 by the crumbling Nazi Regime. They never saw combat however. Their huge weight and their monstruous fuel guzzling would have made it impossible to be of any help to the already doomed Third Reich. ; In German 'Maus' means 'mouse'.
