credit card hippie
Someone who calls themselves a hippie, because they listen to 'hippie music,' and pretend to go by the hippie values such as peace and open mindness, but really they gossip about people just as much as the regular 'prep' and they spend just as much money on their clothes which is pure irony. Credit Card hippies smoke pot which makes them think they're even more 'hippie-ish,' but while they're high they go out and steal stuff and talk about people. It doesn't take much to be categorized as a 'hippie' and even if you do stuff for your community, being mean still definetly doesn't cut it.
