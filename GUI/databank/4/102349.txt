In certain cases, also refers to an outsider who makes it clear he/she's an outsider, going as far as to make fun of the outsiders to make him/herself look more outside. Will use false accusations and stereotypes to fulfill this. Has no reputable evidence or proof, facts are lacking, and he/she sounds like a total imbecile doing it. For excellent examples, see [canonite] and [nikonian]. Another good place is to do some research on where CONTAX rates (and why you don't ever see new Contax cameras, hmmm, wonder what happened. Did the copy machine company stop making them?) compared to other companies.
