kolobaras
Greek word denoting promiscuous male who engages in anal sex, possibly with both males and females, exclusively in dominant role ('the pitcher'). ; A kolobara who buggers other men may not be considered any less a man; rather, he may be viewed as a more formidable stud for buggering both genders prolifically.
