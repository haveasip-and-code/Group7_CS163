kensington
A small place, known as a town, right outside bethesda. it includes a 'skate park,' one good restraunt (you know which one im talking about), and the cheapest gas for miles. It is a hassle to get to anywhere important from kensington because it is so small. also known as: 'k-town' 'right outside DC' and 'where?'
