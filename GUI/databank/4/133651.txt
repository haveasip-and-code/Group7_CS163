Chicken bomb
A technique used by pissed-off chickens to get back at farmers for feeding them the bread equivilent of soot and mucus and then killing them. It involves bending over just when a farmer is leaning close, and then firing out an egg like a bazooka at around 65-70 mph into his face. Those who get egg shell in his eye get a standing ovation and double their daily ration of corn.
