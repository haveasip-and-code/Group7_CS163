rita cosby
The term Rita Cosby can be assigned to any female who has a deep, throaty voice. The word itself is derived from Rita Cosby, a journalist, once on Fox News, has now moved over to MSNBC and has since then gotten her own show. Rita has an almost frighteningly deep voice that is more characteristic of a man in drag than a woman. Since getting her own show, her low-pitched voice has become one of her trademarks.
