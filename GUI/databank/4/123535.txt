pittsford
The true 'hood, the ghetto, the projects, whatever you call the slums of new york state. it be located in Upstate New York and it is near Rochester,and in the middle of the surrounding towns of Henrietta, East Rochester, Mendon, Fairport, and Perinton and it is tha hardest place u will eva find. The main parts of it are, the town of pittsford, which includes the communities of Meadowgate (Tha Hardest streets of pittsford, also where I live), Bushnells Basin, (near meadowgate, and also very ghetto), The area near East Rochester and Monroe Ave, and the Thornell/Park Rd. Area. (fairly ghetto. And the other half of pittsford, The Village Of Pittsford, which is based on the Erie canal and Includes the Schoen Place area, and is associated with the reast of the west side of pittsford, such as the calkins road area. the village is a cool hang-out spot as long as you from there. If you a homie from the town, you best watch yo back when stompin in the village, cause gangstas there don't like eastsidaz and theres a lot of crews there. Vice Versa for damn villagers that be all up in the town, (step up in the town, and u won't be found). I mean in pittsford, theres crazy crime, drugs, and maddd violence. The biggest gang is probably the CKC (Cracka Kill'n Committee) them brothas be straight up crazy. Once you find yo place and pick a set to patrol, learn yo envrionment, and get wit a gang, you can feel like you home, just like me.
