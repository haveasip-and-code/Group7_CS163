las vegas
1)Most of you haters think its a place to bang hookers, get married to some bitch you just met, lose all your money gambling, the letter X, etc. 2)Tourist think its a nice city with casinos, lights, fine restaurants, good attractions etc. 3)But we residents think its a place that isn't filled with bullshit, good weather after you get used to it. Many people move out here from California because they need the money or recently lost their jobs.
