fleetwood mac
An L.A. area band from the 70's and 80's. The band included vocalist [Stevie Nicks], guitarist [Lindsey Buckingham], and Keyboardist[Christine Mcvie], as well as the charter members, Bassist [John Mcvie] (Christine's now ex husband) and Drummer [Mick Fleetwood](both of whom played in the original, more bluesy Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green and Bob Welch). The modern band released several albums, including their very successful self-titled debut album, which included the songs Monday Morning, [Landslide],Rhiannon,Say That You Love Me, and I'm So afraid. They followed it with one of the best selling CDs ever (selling 18 Million copies by 1998), with the 1977 release of Rumors. The CD was a concept album dealing with the tension in the group. It had songs such as 'Dreams,' 'Don't Stop,' 'Go Your Own Way,' 'Songbird,' 'The Chain,' 'You Make Loving Fun,' and 'Gold Dust Woman.' It was followed with a less successful, but still heavily purchased album called 'Tusk.' ; After breaking up in the late 80's the group reunited for President Clunton's inagugural ball. They got back together for a reunion tour called 'The Dance' which produced a CD by the same name. ; Christine Mcvie left the band in 2003, due to her distaste for touring, but the band carried on, creating Say You Will, their first solo album since 1988's Tango in the Night.
