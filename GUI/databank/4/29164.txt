PSG-1
Praezisionschutzengewehr('precision shooting rifle'). Considered by many to be the most accurate semi-auto sniper rifle in the world. It was developed in response to the 1972 Munich Olympics, in which the current sniper's weapon, the G3SG1, was not accurate enough to make a good shot. It uses the same system from the G3 assault rifle, a roller-locked delayed blowback action. It has a unique fully-adjustable butt stock as well as an adjustable trigger shoe. It also comes with a specially-developed mini-tripod. It can only use one scope, that being the one issued with the rifle, a 6x42 Hensholdt scope. It has a weird form of extraction in which it flings the spent casing nearly 32 feet from the weapon, which is one reason why it isn't popular with professional armies. The other reason is that the weapon is very heavy, weighing nearly 18 pounds. All this comes at a very hefty price tag of $10,000 dollars.
