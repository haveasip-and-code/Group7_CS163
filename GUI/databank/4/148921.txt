wooker
a clump of hair that has bunched up. mostly found in sinks, trimming, or on the floor after trimming or cutting hair. a soggy wooker is created when the wooker is wet. these are found in sinks and home water drains. the term spawns from the movie Star Wars in honor of the Wookies. the term originates from speech in rural areas. much like how 'son of a bitch' became 'som bitch'.
