Millennial Generation
The American generation succeeding [Generation X]. They are named as such due to their coming-of-age at around the turn of the millenium in some way, shape, or form. A realistic time frame would be early 1980s to mid 1990s. Given that 9/11 was the defining moment of this generation, anyone too young to remember or not born yet would be grouped into the Homeland Generation. Some sources put the end of the Millennial Generation as late as 2003, but as I just said, this is an amazingly meaningless definition.
