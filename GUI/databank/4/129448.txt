original edge
simalar to straight edge but has nothing to do with music. U dont do anything to destruct ur body or anything stupid like drink, smoke, do drugs, or have sex in an uncommited relationship. but unlike straight edge there are no unclear rules. you can listen, look, or even act the way u want just dont be self destructive
