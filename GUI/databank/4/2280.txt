Graal
A game in which the main object is to kill other players. Most servers have many quests to gain weapons and increase your health. Many people take advantage of other people's lag or stalk new players. These people are called lamers. After getting a kill, many people say 'owned,' 'ph33r m3,' 'I'm [1337],' etc. Even if someone dies they'll say 'owned,' because they are complete idiots. The best Graal server is [Maloria]. Graal is a highly addictive game.
