this modern world
An awesome comic strip drawn by artist Tom Tommorow that satirizes our government and other political aspects of life in the U.S.A. He uses characters drawn in a 50's style to poke fun at life today in... you guessed it, the modern world. It's published in a number of [altie newspapers] and online.
