Techno
Techno isnt really music. techno is electronic sounds coinciding to some kind of beat. Only when applied to some other form of music as a joke or backround sound can it then be 'labeled' as music.unless at a rave. By itself it is literally nothing most people would want to listen to even if offered money. (possible exageration)
