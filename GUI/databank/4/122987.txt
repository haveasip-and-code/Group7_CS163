Shadowmancy
A type of magic that involves the control over shadows, the ultimate goal being to become as a shadow. The practicioners of this magic offer their soul and body to become one with shadows. They have power in life, but in death, they are bound to another shadowmancer, until they pass away, and they are sent to another. This is a big trade-off, however, but many are willing to take it because of their shear devotion.
