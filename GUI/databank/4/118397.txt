bape
A former 'cool' clothing brand. ; Died out because loser rap artists and dumb white people wore it. Idiots from American and Gaijin who listen to 'I THINK I'M TURNING JAPANESE' by the Vapors too much. ; It's not even cool in Japan anymore, it hasn't been cool for the last 5 years. ; People in America need to get a clue about fashion. America's fashion is years behind European and Asian fashion. ; As a Japanese person, I laugh at all these newjacks trying to act cool in their 'has been' fashion. ; Please I had this shit a long time ago.
