Brawl hall
A web site dedicated to hacking, spamming and destroying other internet boards so they will feel good about themselves. They threaten people, alter images of children, and when you enter their forums you receive hard-to-detect trojan viruses, popups and even spyware. The site has also been alleged to have stolen cookies from browsers so that they can get passwords from other sites their users would normally visit. A very sad place.
