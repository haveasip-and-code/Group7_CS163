bodwin
Noun. Insulting name meaning someone who has no social life and just spends most of their time indoors on the computer, watching TV etc. Usually aimed at someone who isn't actually a bodwin and used as a general insult. Whenever possible, when using the insult, it must be accompanied by a hand gesture. The hand gesture is placing the hand horizontal, palm facing upwards, with the index finger touching the thumb to make a circle, with the remaining three fingers pointing at whoever is being called a bodwin. (This hand gesture can be used for [laters], [dish], [butters] as well as bodwin)
