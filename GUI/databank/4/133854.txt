a pretty damn good highschool. way better than [broughton]. we're in the top 50-something in the us, which is good for north cakalaki. there's a good amount of hot guys and girls, but watch out, there is a 75% chance that a nice looking young man [takes it up the butt], and that's ok with most people there, except the homophobes. best swim team around. worst football team around. not much school spirit, but we make up for that in art and smart people. because WE are smarter than YOU.
