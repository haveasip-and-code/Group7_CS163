Alien Vs. Predator
The movie that all but destroyed the Alien and Predator movie franchises. Released in 2004 by 20th Century Fox and was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, resident video-game adaptation hack. Follows a group of humans as they run around a pyramid for an hour, getting killed off one by one, until the only woman left alive, Alexa Woods, teams up with the Predator, and the movie suddenly changes from a sci-fi movie to a buddy flick.
