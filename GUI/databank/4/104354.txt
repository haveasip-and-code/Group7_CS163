narrow minded
Intolerant of another's views. This is a mentality that is often associated with [cliques] and [coteries]. A narrow-minded person will even accuse someone of being 'stupid' or ((name some other bad trait here, even 'narrow-minded' itself!)) the other person who expresses a viewpoint or reason for believing otherwise than the narrow-minded one's views. Or, in some cases, a narrow-minded person might even go to the extreme of primate-like behavior, such as throwing food or insults at the other person, because the narrow-minded one doesn't have a cohesive argument to counteract what the other had said in the discussion or debate. ; Interesting thing: people who accuse others of being narrow-minded are often quite narrow-minded themselves. ; [cliques], [coteries], [narrowminded], [narrow minded], [narrow-minded], [narrow mind], [intolerant]
