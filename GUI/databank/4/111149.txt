foggot
A variation of 'faggot', but designed for those who are sick of the word 'faggot' and it's pseudo-manly, fake alpha male appeal. Especially those in chatrooms who throw about the word 'faggot' every fucking second without realising there is no 'sexuality' in a 'chat room'. Also, not to mention, 'faggot' is by far the most boring, meaningless insult in existence. Therefore, the word foggot is a funnier, more witty usage of the word. Which doesn't 100% have to mean homosexual and isn't 100% insulting. Thus, it can be thrown at anyone, even yourself, and you never really know what to expect from this word, hahahahahaha.
