Hello Dolly!
A great film, made in 1969, starring [Barbra Streisand] (not my favorite person, but she does good in this film). About a woman who wants to marry a man and steals all the people around him (by setting them up with other people so they move away), leaving him alone and no other choice then to marry her. Sure she makes it so he practically makes him beg for her love, though she had expressed it from the beginning. All that matters are the great songs and Dolly's CRAZY hats.
