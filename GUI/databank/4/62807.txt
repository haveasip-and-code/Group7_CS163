karma payment plan
A system by which seemingly magical improvements in one's life are given by mysterious forces in exchange for a sense of unease not unlike that given from selling one's soul, often actually (but not always) resulting in misfortune. ; Taken from the Modest Mouse song 'Karma's Payment' and the unfailingly portentious cynicism of Isaac Brock. ; 'Remember that huge freaking electrical storm we had a couple weeks back? I stood out in the middle of it on the roof of like this chicken coop and held a metal guitar above my head. I didn't get struck by lightning, but I suppose that's just because God has something special, something much, much worse that he's saving for me.'
