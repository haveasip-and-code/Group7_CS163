shiv
A character from the popular show 'Static Shock' on Cartoon Network. One of the Bang Baby villains, Shiv is oriental in appearance, with indigo spiked hair and a goatee, deep black eyes and a manic grin. ; Shiv's apparell consists of a white t-shirt under a dark red half-sleeved jacket, open and scoop-neck, with black cuffs and a black band across the bottom. He also wears a pair of dark red pants, and oriental-style black slippers. ; Shiv's real name is Scott Drake Takoshi, he's 17 years of age and (in my not so humble opinion) verrrrrrrrrry cute. ^_^ His power is manipulation of light-energy; he can create light weapons with his hands. Ninja-stars, lanterns, ropes, chains, pipes, samuari swords, and many other weapons and items imaginable, including sabers, or shivs, hence the origin of his name.
