8 mile
A large, 4+lane semi-highway which runs east-to-west in southeastern Michigan. It is physically the dividing line between Detroit and Warren (in relation to Eminem's movie), as well as a number of other suburbs. ; On its easternmost part, 8-Mile road runs through very wealthy areas. A few miles west, you will find the Eastland Center Mall, which is very nice, but almost completely Afro-Centric (lots of stores selling rap clothing, etc.). It's all downhill from there -- it gets better once you hit Southfield, though. ; Nobody can doubt that it is a racial divide. Warren, for the most part, is almost completely white, while the Detroit side is predominantly black. ; 8-Mile is not cool. It's actually sleazy and boring. There's lots of strip clubs and crummy convenience stores, as well as check cashing and furniture rental places. ; Warren is not entirely lower-class. Rather, it is a city with many income divides. Basically, the higher the mile number (ie. 10-Mile Road), the better the area. By 12 Mile, it's completely Middle Class, and most of 10-11 Mile is too, with the exception of a few pockets of starter homes and some apartment complexes known for their drug problems.
