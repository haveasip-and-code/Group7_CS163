body hug
When you are in love with your partner, and like to feel close to them, instead of giving them a hug, you give them a body hug - Using every part of your body to be as close as you can to your partner. ; Both lie down on a bed/sofa etc. Then you hug each other with your arms, legs, and the rest of your body.
