gangstarab
A gangstarab can be defined as a member of a narcissistic herd of young, 'urban' Indian men. They congregate in colleges across the nation, wearing their expensive denim jeans and Timberland boots. Although they try to impose a frightening demeanor, they are cowardly and non-threatening to any form of matter. 'Gangstarab' is essentially a sardonic play-on-words of their self-proclaimed gangster images, and a misnomer of their ethnicity (generalizing Indians to be Arabs). They usually smell of curry and fashion grade leather.
