Anthony Mundine
A famous boxer from Australia. ; Unless you are reaching the end of your career/tether as a boxer, you wont have much chance of facing him. As he only likes to do mismatches, and fight people way beneath him. ; In one such mismatch, he fought a Panamanian. At the time, 'The Man' was ranked number 4 in the world, while his Panamanian opponent was at number 200 or so. Which creates a mixed idea of a man, who is at the top of his game, but fights weaklings, who are beneath him, for some cheap thrills.
