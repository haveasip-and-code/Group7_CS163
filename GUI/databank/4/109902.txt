anatsuken
The [fictional?] martial art practiced by Street Fighter characters commonly mistaken for practicing Shotoken. It's a combination of several martial arts including kung fu, jujutsu, possibly shotoken, and others. These characters are commonly mistaken to be practicing shotoken karate, but the only character in the series that probably practices this is Makoto.
