Guiney
A colloquialism for a gynaecologist. It's believed to have originated in Ireland and is probably because an unusually large amounts of Guiney's (a family which began in Cork and Mayo.) became Gynaecologist. From there the contraction of the word Gynaecologist is obvious... although why such a high percentage of Guiney's chose to work in this career is lost in the mists of time.
