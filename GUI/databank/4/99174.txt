Breath of Fire 3
A game that is the essence of perfection. It is the only perfect video game I have played. It is flawless. Classic old-school look and feel. Lots of cool characters. And above all, an original story that doesn't involve evil plots or saving the world. And we can't forget the awesome soundtrack this game has. Everyone should be required to play and like this game.
