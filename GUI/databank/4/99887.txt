gaytoo
another word for the linux distribution 'gentoo'. ; gentoo (gaytoo) users are known for pseudo-elite behaviour, thinking they'd compile their progs on their own and having a phenomal speed advantage. ; in reality gentoo users wait hours or days to install some basic programs where the speed advantage melts away because they lack skills how to set up their systems correctly. ; after weeks of system set up, they immediately swarm out into irc channels an annoy other linux users with discussions about how 'cool' and '31137' it would be to use gentoo (gaytoo). ; if you recognize gentoo (gaytoo) users in you forums/irc-channels/etc. try to ban them permanently!
