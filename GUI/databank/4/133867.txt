Figure It Out
Used commonly by Marx. When someone does not know what to do or is just to lazy to read directions he is told to 'FIGURE IT OUT!' It had become widely used amongst the young folk as well now a days. Through the halls you can hear FIGURE IT OUT. The term also works with the addition of SON at the end of it. To avoid the usage of this phrase, read directions, put forth a little effort to grasp the task ahead of you, and for godsake son FIGURE IT OUT!
