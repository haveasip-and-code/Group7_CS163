Einstein
Albert Einstein, b. 1879, d. 1955. ; Considered by many to be the greatest scientist of the 20th century, being named by Time magazine as 'Man of the Century'. ; A [physicist], he won a Nobel Prize for his discovery of the photoelectric effect (1905), which explained how a [photon] causes an [electron] to be emitted from a metallic surface when illuminated by light, by postulating that photons are discrete 'quanta' of [energy]. ; He also devised the Theory of Special [Relativity] (1905), which deals with the perception of time and distance between observers in different frames of reference that are moving relative to each other, and postulated that the [speed of light] is the same in all frames of reference. ; Later he expanded this into the Theory of General Relativity (1907), which explains the force of [gravity] as a geometric warping of [space]-[time] and treats acceleration and gravity as equivalent forces acting on [matter]. ; Born a [Jew] in [Germany], he came to [America] just prior to the [Nazi]'s rise to power (1932), and never returned to his homeland. ; He spent the last years of his life attempting to combine the fundamental forces into a single unified [field] theory, but without success. ; Ironically, his name is used as a derogatory term for persons who proclaim something obvious or who do something especially [stupid].
