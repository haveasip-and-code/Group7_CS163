general lee
Originally, the '69 Dodge Charger from the tv show, 'The Dukes of Hazzard. The car had a 426 hemi that Luke had built and bought a car to put it in. The car was then painted orange with the confederate flag on the roof and the number 01, and of course, it was called the general lee. The car was altered very little, unless it was getting jumped, the only cosmetic add on other than the paint was a grill gaurd. In some episodes the car had a 440 magnum rather than the hemi, but who noticed?. Now, there are a large number of people who have meticulously rebuilt their own general lee chargers, so there are much more general lee's in existance now.
