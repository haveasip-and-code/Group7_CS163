Asperger's Syndrome
A form of higher functioning autism. Generally, victims or of average to above average intelligence, most notably being both creative and extremely gifted in subjects which require logical thought such as mathematics. While academically Asperger's Syndrome sufferers excel, their development of social skills is limited. Generally, a victim will lack the words to say something, the inclination to say something or the guts to say what they feel, often too nervous or intimidated to enter conversation. In addition, they despise eye contact, dislike being hugged and value their personal space. Some may have seemingly odd habits such as flapping their hands, but not all. Also, narrow and somewhat peculiar hobbies are common. Those with AS tend to have an extremely active or extremely passive lifestyle, lack of self esteem, problems sleeping, generaly use very informal, complex language during conversation and, unlike loners, actually wish to fit in.
