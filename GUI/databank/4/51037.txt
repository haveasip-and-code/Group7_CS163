MiM
MiM - acronym for 'Mr. Internet Man'. Anyone who uses the internet to solve 99 to 100% of their problems using the WWW or world wide web. Taking this pathway of knowledge away from someone would be fatal, and would cause them to rely on finding a person of opposite sex (T^, CW * please refer back for future references) to get them through the outage.
