surf
Fuckin' sick ass sport, riding down THE FACE of waves on a fiberglass covered foam board. But has too many posers. ; Listen, assholes. Just cause you wear your white O'Neill sweatshirt and cruise on the whitewater once a year and hang out in surfshops every weekend, doesn't mean you're a surfer. ; Fucking tards. Posers, and localized fuckwits like Miki Dora ruined the sport. ; Still fun though. Just fuck off, posers.
