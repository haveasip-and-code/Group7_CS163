Gregson
A dreadful 'community based' club in Lancaster where it is possible to find the very worst of the irritating middle class, over-educated, 'alternative' and politically correct inhabitants of that town along with their hideous offspring. ; Even though it seems to be, and would like to be thought of, as a haven for 'good people', in reality it is Gregson uber alles. ; Cheap to hire though.
