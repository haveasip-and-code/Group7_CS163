Ba Ram You
I would think it would really be 'Baa Ram Ewe,' because it was sheep talking. In the movie 'Babe,' Ma the Sheep gives Babe this 'password' to get the sheep he was herding to listen to him and to realize that he's not a 'wolf' like the 'other' dogs. The sheep hear it, and, as only sheep know about this secret phrase, instantly respect Babe and quiety cooperate, allowing Babe to impress the farmer and win a sheep herding competition.
