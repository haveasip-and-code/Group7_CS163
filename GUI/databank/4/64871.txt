Skanking
A form of dancing originating in Jamaica, now most notably done in Ska/Reggae shows. A more violent form of skanking is often found in punk or hardcore shows. There are many forms of skanking, varying from extreme movement to very little movement at all. To skank: First, feel the beat. Get those arms swinging slightly and feel the bounce as you swing your hips. Move your weight from one foot to the other with each skank. Make sure your arms and legs coordinate (ie: If your right fist is moving forward, you should also be moving your right knee forward as you shift your weight. Then shift to the left.) The most familiar form of skanking today is the Two-Tone Ska style in which you add a kick forward with every beat. Skanking is most often done in a group, either in a general 'pit' (such as in a [most pit]) or by skanking around in a circle.
