The most amazing strategy game on the planet. Created by da man Sid Meijer, it lets you start out as one man creating a capital in the middle of the wilderness. Once you take out all the barbarians, you can advance to the middle and industrial ages and build mass tank forces to take over your rival countries. The best country is Egypt by gaining an industrial and religious benefit. You can also advance to the nuclear age and blow everyone up with ICBM's, it is great.
