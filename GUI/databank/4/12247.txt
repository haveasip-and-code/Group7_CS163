swinton fringe
A haircut that was popular in the mid-90's that was started off in swinton, greater manchester. It involves having all of the hair shaved off to a '1' or a '0' but leaving the fringe either all the way round or just the middle of the forehead. It is still popular in the north-east and scotland now apparently.
