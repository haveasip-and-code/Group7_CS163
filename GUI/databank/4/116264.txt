vampire
1. A sanguivore is the kind of vampire with the need for blood. These guys are the real kind, but are mortal, have a reflextion, and are only SENSITIVE to light. They can go out in the sun and eat garlic and touch roses so get that fairytale crap out of your head. They need blood, though. They don't neccesarily LOOK like a vamp or have the folklore vampire lifestyle. AKA a sang vamp. ; 2. A psy vamp feeds off of energy rather than blood. Sometimes a sang vamp is short on food and resorts to psy techniques. AKA an energy vampire. ; 3. A vampyre looks like one a vamire, but doesn't neccesairly need blood. A vampyre is 'into' the whole vamp thing and can be considered to have a vampire fetish, but doesn't need blood and might not even be into that area. ; 4. Awakening is when a true vamp goes through a 'puberty' of sorts and realizes what they are. ; 5. Turning is when a normal person becomes a vamp through a scarcely known techinque. ; 6. Blood Fetishists don't need blood and AREN'T vampires, they just LIKE it, whether it be sexual or just for kicks and giggles.
