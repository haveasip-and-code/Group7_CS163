A great animator from Britain who's 'Salad Finger' series has made him sort of an internet phenom. I particularly enjoy his use of drawing on paper then animating it as in 'Black and White Cartoon' Series. Genius, one funny fucking genius, and his sick twisted humor is especially funny to me at least.
