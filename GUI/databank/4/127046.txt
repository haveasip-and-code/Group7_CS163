fresbian
Fresbian: a person of heterosexual orientation whose life is intensely affected by his/her lesbian friends and/or family; literally 'friend of a lesbian' ; A fresbian is a friend of lesbians (at least one), who supports them and does not judge their lifestyle. Lesbians may bring intense drama to the lives of their heterosexual friends, but fresbians do not abandon them. On the contrary, they counsel and console the lesbians. Fresbians often reach a comfort level where they may joke about lesbianism, without it being offensive to their homosexual friend.
