Perth Amboy
Perth Amboy is the ghetto or Barrio City of Middlesex County. It is an overwhelmingly [working class] and Hispanic small town. It's part of the rust belt and the factories have left the waters polluted. Until the 19oos the water was suitable for fishing. However, the waterfront is being redeveloped. It also features a nice view, a small marina, and history.
