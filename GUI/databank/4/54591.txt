Ravens are much like large crows with boxy tail feathers [A signature of the raven], a long, thick beak, and a wingspan sometimes reaching nearly six feet. The Raven has a much deeper call than the crow, with a croak rather than a caw. ; 2: The famous bird from Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Raven' ; 3: An animal frequent in many mythologies. In Norse Mythology [That of the Vikings/Scandinavians] Odin, the All-Father God, has two Ravens named Huginn and Muninn [Thought and Memory] that travel to Midgard -- the world of Men -- and report the happenings back to him.
