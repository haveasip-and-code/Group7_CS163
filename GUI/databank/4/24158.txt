Zilmoth
A group of stoners one of them named 'Zilante' were all high and it is presumed that someone was about to call out 'Zilante' and someone else saw a moth and said 'Moth!' and two and two were put together and from then on, Zilante was dubbed 'Zilmoth' It can also be used with other words to make things like 'Zil[draige]'
