Fa Sheezy
Probably the most Stolen and copied slang word of our generation that came from Oakland,(The Town)CA, USA. This word was created by Keak Da Sneak from the legendary Oakland, Mob group, 3 X Crazy. It means 'Fa Sho' or for you squares out there 'For Sure' or Most Definitely. Or like you East Coast people say, 'No Doubt' ; To set the record str8...Anytime you put 'eezy' on the end of a word, (breezy, heezy, meezy, etc.) You are simply saying something that started from Oakland ans specifically Keak.
