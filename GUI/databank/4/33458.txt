SING!
A theater competition where everything is student-run, meaning its student-written, student-directed, and all the acting, dance, and tech crews are students. The competition is between Seniors, Juniors, and Soph-Frosh. While the quality of the shows costumes, sets, etc are lower than that of normal theater productions, and it's generally a contest to see how many half-naked girls they can get on stage and how many sex jokes can be crammed into 55 minutes, it is in fact a lot of fun. Performed at Stuyvesant, Midwood, and other schools.
