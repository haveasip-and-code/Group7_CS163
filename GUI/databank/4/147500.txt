Iranian
They are [Aryans] ('True [Aryan] Race') Iran was originally called 'Iranshahr', meaning 'Land of the Aryans' ; They are semites as well. ; They are not white people, but in the US they are classified as 'white', which is extremely offending to their heritage. ; They speak Farsi, not Arabic. (Farsi is mainly a mixture of pure Persian, Arabic, and Turkish) Arabic words are in Farsi due to the Arabs conquering Iran hundreds of years ago. Turkish words are in Farsi because, the Safavid Empire's (one of the three Persian Empires) official language was Turkish.
