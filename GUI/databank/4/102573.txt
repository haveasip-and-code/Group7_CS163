BYU
Brigham Young University is located in Provo, Utah with two other schools baring the same name in Idaho and Hawaii. Consists mostly of Mormons, but others are admitted. Most girls go there with hopes of not getting an education, but meeting a nice, good-looking returned missionary to take to the temple and get hitched to. It's a very nice school, but like I said, it's a meat market.
