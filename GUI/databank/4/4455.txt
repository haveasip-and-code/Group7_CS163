Char to Holly
My best friend since I was three years old. Yeah thats right we met on a dirt pile in front of my house, how cool is that? Shes a kick ass girl with a kick ass personality, thats what i love most about her. We've had our diffrences but shes still there for me. We share the same hobbies, like soccer and we both like to play our instruments (atleast i hope she does). Shes a ReaLly $RicH$ bitch and i'm, i'm just rich. haha. Shes awesome to hang out with, no wonder so many people love her. Shes one of the coolest people i've ever met, maybe the coolest. BfFL
