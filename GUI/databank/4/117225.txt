ar gar
Just like Cha-ha. A word that means, Im really laughing but totally not. It can be used as a cover up word. If you didnt mean to say whatever just came out of your mouth, you can cover it up with an ar gar. Also, you can use ar gar as a surfer laugh. Just like cha ha. Like..cha ha that was great. Surfs up, ar gar.
