anorexia
It's a DISEASE you retards. Someone with the disease can't just start eating like normal. For those of you who say it's only for rich teen girls with low self esteem, you're way wrong. It can stem from many things. So I suggest you keep your mouth shut if you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
