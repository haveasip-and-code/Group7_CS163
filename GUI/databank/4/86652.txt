Trogdor the Burninator
In [Dungeons & Dragons] lore, 'Trogdor the Burninator' was thirty year-old Half-Elf, chaotic-neutral Cleric of Taiaii with an affinity for fire. Trogdor was also a very stupid man, deciding that obliterating a tavern with fire would be a good way to interogate a bartender who knew more than he let on. The half-elf was then challenge by a monk and killed the holy man, but only barely. Afterwards, he urinated on the monk's body, then chased after an Elven archer that was in his party. The Elven archer noticed Trogdor forgot to put away his 'piece' and promptly shot an arrow into his unguarded crotch, scoring a maximum-damage critical hit which promptly killed the Burninator. ; More information can be found at the RPG Mortuary.
