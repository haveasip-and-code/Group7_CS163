mercury
1st planet from the sun. Hot on both sides. 2nd hottest planet(second to [venus], the 2nd planet from the sun). its year is the shortest because it's path around the sun is shorter(you'd be like twice as old there). if you visited venus you'd die. you step on the ground and you burst into flame. just like arizona.
