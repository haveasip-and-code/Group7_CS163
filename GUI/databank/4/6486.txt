Man, this band kicks utter ass. All four are great musicians, but my personal favourite is Phil, the rhythm guitarist who looks a bit woman-like. But Christian, the other guitarist, does some kick-ass solos. Despite looking like a horse. ; I am seeing them live in 5 days, and can't wait at all. ; Particularly good songs: Blacken My Thumb, Sittin' Pretty, Motherfucker from Hell and Transistor.
