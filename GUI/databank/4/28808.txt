judge's gavel
when a woman has your [bean bag] in her mouth and you're banging your johnson against her forehead (i.e. pounding the gavel), when you're getting ready to bust a nut, yell out 'Case Closed!' or 'Here Comes the Judge!' ; Variations include tossing your chowder in her eye (or ear) and shouting 'Case Dismissed!' or pulling out early and shouting 'I Find You in Contempt!' before flipping her over and performing the [bobsled].
