Mayfield Senior School
A private Catholic school located in Southern California, sometimes refered to as 'The Bitches on Bellefontaine.' The students and teachers are nice enough, but the administration is Nazi-ish. They give demerits for wearing the wrong colored socks, and they fire all the teachers the students actually like, while retaining the ones who cannot teach. It is in possession of one rather terrifying nun, known as Sister Babs and is partially run by a scary blonde ex-PE teacher.
