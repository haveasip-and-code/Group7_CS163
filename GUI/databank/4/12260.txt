xmas
what non religious 'christians' celebrate. People who are only in it for the presents celebrate xmas. Real christians celebrate christmas. Christmas is for christian people. Everyone who celebrates xmas is a holiday stealer, because they don't even understand christmas and they're stealing it from the christian people.
