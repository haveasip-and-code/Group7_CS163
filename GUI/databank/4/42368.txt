cosi
a coffee, bar, and sandwich shop from the east coast that is slowly moving across the country. if you are on the [main line] you will see that the parking lot of the bryn mawr cosi is constantly filled with luxury cars, tanned girls in north face fleeces and boys in polo shirts. however, their bread is amazing.
