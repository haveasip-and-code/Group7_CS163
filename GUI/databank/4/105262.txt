Q-Bomb
A Quark Bomb. ; A next generation atomic weapon, suggested in some scientific journals as possible. ; Essentially it is a weapon which somehow splits open protons to release their quarks, the subatomic particles which make up protons, in theory releasing masses of energy. (possibly about 1200 times more energy than an atomic bomb of similar size) ; Made widely known in the novel Red Star Coffee (amazing novel, even if it does rip off Neon Genesis Evangelion towards the end). In this, defence shields could protect against incoming nuclear missiles, but Q-Bombs were so powerful they were unstoppable. ; It was thought the UN had some, although this was later proved false by the fact they were forced to use the Lance of Longinus.
