ballooning
One of the most fun things to do in the entire world. An act that consists of a large shopping bag full of water balloons, skilled throwers, and a patient driver. The people drive around looking for innocent pedestrians, and they launch water balloons at them. This is very fun (especially if you know your victim), but extremely hard to get good at. ; Variations of this activity include a game, where you score points! ; 1 point for a snipe. (a hit anywhere that gets them) ; 2 points for a direct hit. (an awesome shot that nails them. ; 5 points for a head shot. (rare but rewarding)
