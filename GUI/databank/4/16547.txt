sicarius
A monstrous being with an obsession for flags and things that go 'boom!' Anything that startles him is at high risk for a swift donkey punch, awakening only to find themselves trapped in a box en route to Abudabi. ; (Can be seen on weekends playing hide-and-seek with Sasquatch and the LockNess Monster)
