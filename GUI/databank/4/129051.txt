glory hunters
These people have NO interest in their national team UNTIL the team becomes successful. All of a sudden millions of insecure souls CLING to every victory. It's a sorry sight, but quite common in England! Glory Hunters only follow a team while the successes roll in .... once the team does badly they look to another sport or team!
