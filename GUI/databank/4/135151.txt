urban cowboy
A guy from the city or suburbs who is 'country' or 'rednickish' who talks like he's from a rural area. Ften times they wear shirts of the American flag that says 'these colors don't run' and say things like 'If you don't like America, then you can get out!' Generally they smoke and drink and often times wear cowboy hats or Nascar hats. Though it sounds like I'm trying to depict these guys in a negative way, I am actually quite fond of them, especially the ones who I think offer a lot of 'white trash wisdom', like the 'Stranger' in the movie 'The Big Lebowski' when he says 'sometimes you eat the barn, and sometimes the barn eats you'. Many of these guys are quite smart, despite their gruffish exterior.
