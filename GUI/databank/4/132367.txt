sparkle cigarette
A cigarette that, when smoked, bright sparks fly from the end. It is made by using a lighter in very brief bursts to ever so slightly melt the cellophane on the cigarette box or pack. The cigarette is then immediately rolled on the cellophane to coat it with the plastic. If you can see the plastic melting, you've done too much.
