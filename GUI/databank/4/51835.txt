North Harford High School
The school located in Northern Harford County near the Baltimore County and Pennsylvania lines. Yes, we have an extensive Agriculture Department, an on-campus barn with livestock, and a 'Drive Your Tractor To School' Day. But that's ok. We are awesome kids who throw the best damn field parties ever and we'd rather be labeled as 'hicks' than be a Fallston heroin addict. We always say 'hello' and are genuinely the nicest and most sincere people you will ever meet. The parking lot consists of BIG trucks and...more trucks. We drink beer, listen to country music, and wear Carhartts all year long. We hang out in barns, fields, or anywhere the 4-wheel drive can take us. Our sports teams are awesome...fear the hawk. We have the usual cliques - preps, jocks, freaks, geeks and plain Janes but we all share one common pride, 'Once a duckfarmer, always a duckfarmer.'
