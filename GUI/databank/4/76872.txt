Saud
A person who has many friends but at the same time hated by many. Usually because he or she makes fun of all the rejects that go to school with social and/or phycological issues. A Saud is known to be extremely cockey and confident as well as ridiculously intelligent and talented. People who dislike Sauds include people who are considered emo(tional), people who resemble farm animals, people that are athletically challenged, alcholics, people from other towns, fans of my chemical romance, jappy people, people with low self esteem, people who are jealous of Saud's incredible intelligence, and anyone who lacks friends in general.
