Abecrombie & Fitch
A clothing corporation run by egostical pricks who find pleasure in ripping off the youth of today by selling them clothing for 70$ that is made to look shitty that you could be in tact for 25$ and make it look just as shitty at home. They also find pleasure in ripping young girls off on clothing that is called preppy that costs around 80$ for clothing that is usually about 6 inches long with no skill needed to make that makes them look like complete sluts and be proud of it. they also often say that there fabric is imported, but where is it imported from? I am willing to bet from sweat shops in china run by little 8 year old asian kids.
