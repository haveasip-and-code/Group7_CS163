A neverending puzzle game made originally for sega's 16bit arcade hardware and ported to the Megadrive. ; Was later ported to the 8bit Master System but the less said about that the better. ; Often wrongly referred to as a 'tetris clone' as the gameplay is completley different - colored gems must be aligned together to destroy them and prevent them filling the screen. Columns pwns Tetris' ass all night long ; This was where the fun began, Without the arcade's timing system constantly badgering you for money you are free to start a game of colums and forfeit the rest of the day. The haunting music in your dreams for eternity. ; Eventually as the game speeds up the gems can be slowed by 'dropping' them, but by this stage you aint blinked in an hour and the game seems to be playing itself any way. ; More adictive than crack; A truly great game. ; Is basically a metaphor for life, but I aint got time to explain ; A universal excuse for not doing something.
