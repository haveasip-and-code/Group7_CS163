wristbands
A coloured silicone band that you put around your wrist. They were made for charities to increase donations. ; Now some sick b******s are making fakes just to make money and people everywhere buy them and don't give a s**t about the charities!!! ; (A beutiful idea that has been abused in an ugly way) For Shame...
