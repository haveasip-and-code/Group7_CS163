Vanderbilt
That university in Nashville Tennessee. Where everyone wears polo shirts with the collars popped, guys have seersucker shorts and flip flops and girls miniskirts and Ugg boots or flip flops. Where the frats and sororities reign supreme. Where drunkeness is expected. Where your social status as a freshman is determined by whether you live in Branscomb or Kissam. Where there are more rival fans than Vandy fans at football games. Where everyone is too rich and spoiled to give a crap about the world.
