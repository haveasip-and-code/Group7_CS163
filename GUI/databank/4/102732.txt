renee zellweger
Not your two cent actress, completely talented, nominated 3 times for an Academy Award and won one for her role as Ruby in Cold Mountain. She's gorgeous, she's unconventional, she's zesty. She did Kenny Chesney a favor. Recently claimed a spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (2005), well deserved.
