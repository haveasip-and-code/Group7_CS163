Freddie Foxxx
Possibly one of the greatest emcees on earth. Freddie Foxxx (AKA Bumpy Knuckles) has worked with 2Pac, Gang Starr, Benzino, KRS-One, Big Daddy Kane, and many others. Has 4 LPs put (I think). They include 'Freddie Foxxx is Here', 'Crazy Like a Foxxx', 'Industry Shakedown', and 'Konexion'. ; It's a shame that practically nobody has ever heard of him. Doesn't rap about the bitches and hoes, but about world issues and real thug things. Him and 2Pac were very close friends before 2Pac's untimely death (RIP).
