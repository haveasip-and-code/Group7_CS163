party
Genetically modified herbal [cannabis], [weed],[ganger] or [pot] very popular with [stoners] in [England]. Many users smoke party in preference to drinking [alcohol] because they can drive their [crappy] old semi-[pimped] mainland European or Japanese cars, (England doesn't have a car industry to speak of any more) without fear of easily being arrested for driving while under the influence of drugs, something which is expected to change soon because the [police] will be getting road side drug testing equipment.
