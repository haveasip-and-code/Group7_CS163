bible basher
A religious person who is obsessivily you could say, and insanely into his or her religion. They tend to 'bash on' about their religion and try to feed it to you. No disrespect to their religious beliefs, but knowing a bible basher can somtimes get sticky. They tend to be very preotective over their religion, and know nearly everything about it. They will argue the point, and during times of bashing, can become quite violent.
