USA
Stands for [United States of America]. Was initially a colonial territory of Great Britain before declaring independance in 1776. Initially founded on the principle that a central government should only exist to provide security to its people and its borders without intruding on personal freedom and civil liberties. Government was to be focused more on the individual states' powers rather than that of federal ones. Certain recent events probably have the Founding Fathers turning over in their graves, as the great nation they created slowly degenerates into a Police State; something they feared greatly and took great measures to write the Constitution to prevent it. Unfortunately, when the majority of the citizens, and the government, ignore the Constitution, it doesn't help much.
