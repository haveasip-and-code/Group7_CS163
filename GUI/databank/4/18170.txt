your cousin
Like 'yo momma' only... your cousin. Because this one is NOT way overused. And much cooler. Thanks to Kylie, Carolynne, and their tireless efforts to rid our generation of stupid catchphrases. ; [cafo] [cofo] ; AND IT'S YOUR NOT YO, STUPID SICK FREAKS. Your cousin is ashamed of your pronounciation.
