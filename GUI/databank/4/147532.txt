Ape Drape
A hair style related to but distinct from the mullet, hockey hair, Kentucky waterfall, and Cincinnati toupee. The ape drape is defined by its vigorous growth and lack of part. The drape should be shorter in the front but should ease in gracefully to the shoulders without showing any signs of human intervention. In the dim light of an alley, ape drapes should give their owners the silhouette of a mountain gorilla.
