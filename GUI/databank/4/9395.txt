Roof and Tunnel Hacking
At M.I.T., Roof and Tunnel Hacking is a pastime in which students break into restricted areas, most commonly the roofs and tunnels of the institute, in order to explore the hidden, often dis-used parts of the campus and to travel covertly between locations. It is never used to steal or damage things, only to explore.
