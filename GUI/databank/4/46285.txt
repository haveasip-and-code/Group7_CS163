one hitta quitta
origin 1960's hippy term 'one hitter quitter' in reference to amazingly potent marijuana. used now for many different drugs, however in specific reference to tha chronic, this shit has to be so bomb that even an experienced toker will hack and cough for a couple minutes and then not need another hit for at least 30 to 45 minutes...
