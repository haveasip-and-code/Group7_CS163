Furi Kuri
Anime series that appears on [Adult Swim] in the U.S. every so often. Despite having only 6 episodes, it is very popular. Although all the guitar whacking on the head, robots emerging out of said head, and said robots fighting one another seems pointless at first,the plot reveals itself upon closer inspection. The actual plot is not to be discussed, it must be figured out. This is a series that many like, but few understand.
