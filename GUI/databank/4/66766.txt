on the grind
staying 'on the grind' means to work hard, always be hustling, or otherwise engaged in money-making or woman-procuring activities. ; people who were once poor and become wealthy might then become lazy and indolent and spend all day in champagne-filled jacuzzis whereas other newly-successful people might continue to work hard, thus 'staying on the grind'
