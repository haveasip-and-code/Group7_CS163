VHS
Video Home System. A format that plays video on analog tape instead of the ones and zeros on DVDs, giving the picture a more saturated 'film' look whereas on DVD the picture looks washed out with paler fleshtones and exaggerated highlights, but that's ok because it comes with hours of extras instead of the movie itself like a director setting up a shot and kissing Hollywood ass.
