boorgie
abreviated use of the French word 'bourgeoisie' meaning the economic upper class, in communist theory, the social group opposed to the working class in the class struggle ; Although originally a French word, bourgeoisie is commonly used in English because English speakers have not figured out how to place a negative conotation on upper class without using a word from another language.
