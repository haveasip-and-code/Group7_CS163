Gerry Lindgren
Quite possibly the best runner there ever was. He grew up in Spokane, Washington, and had an alcaholic father. He was really wimpy, and when he started high school, he was the biggest wimp there, and was made fun of. He decided to run [cross country] because he wasn't good at any other sport. He ended up setting world records for running later in his life, and was still cool about it. The role model for any runner. He is also another reason {cross country] runners rock, and also shows that it is the best sport.
