Whammy
It is of latin origin, branching from the word whammus meridius meaning the special plant. It means Canibus meridius, or Mary Jane as some crude humor may call it. If you believe this you may either be on whammy or are mentally insane. This is not a joke, you are a blatent idiot. Thankyou and have a nice day
