wamboozie
A fierce creature of the northern American plains, but migrations of their kind have been spotted in the Golan Heights of Israel. Their species is between 1 to 2 meters in height, they have sharp dog-like canines and are covered with short or long hair depending upon their location. Their colors change with the seasons for better hunting capabilities. They have been also reported to sing a high tonal language in order to face rape their unsuspecting victims. Wamboozies are related to habablares, and ragfagnaglers. A good deterrant of a wamboozie attacks is a handful of rolly-pollies or a bottle of jack daniels (they love liquor) trading the liquor will get you on the fast track to becoming friends. However, very few people have survived an encounter with a wamboozie. For they are very cantankerous!
