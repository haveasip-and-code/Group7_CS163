barto
Barto is a subspecies of student native to Orange County. In its natural habitat, the Barto has been observed to be: 'quite the looker' and 'a creature with excellent taste in flannel linen.' However, this creature's taste in clothing and interests has often made it repugnant to females of other subspecies. No female bartos have ever been sighted in the wild.
