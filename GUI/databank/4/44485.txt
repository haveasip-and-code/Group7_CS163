thruxton
A modern motorcycle created by the Triumph motorcycle company. It is a sportbike that captures the 'cafe racer' era of the 60's and 70's. It has a 900 cc parallel twin not unlike the engine in the Triumph Bonneville (the Thruxton is more powerful however). Triumph Thruxtons are purchased by those motorcycle riders who want a sportbike in its most raw form. If you want to pretend that you are a racer riding a race replica, then buy an R1, Gixxer, or CBR. If you want to get a bike that will hold its own and then some in the urban jungle -get a Triumph Thruxton.
