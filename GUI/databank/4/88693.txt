fairy muff (response- Glitter!)
an alternative term for 'fair enough'. ; When me and my finace were stoned, we sat there and wondered where glitter came from. Don't worry, this is going somewhere. We decided that as 'fairies' (in their disney sense) were glittery, it was OBVIOUS that they came glitter. Therefore, glitter is made by factories of fairies, masturbating. They are forced to do so. When they come, they shriek 'glitter'. Now, as Fairy Muff sounds like Fair Enough, me and my fiance started to use it instead. The other one of us would say 'glitter' in a high pitched tone of voice in response.
