The Urbz
The urban version of the popular simulation game [The Sims] for the Game Cube, [Xbox], and [Playstation 2 (PS2)]. Two other versions were made, a version for the [GBA], and a port (A direct copy with a few extra additions) was made for the [Nintendo DS], but it wasn't as good as the other Nintendo DS games and the DS version of [Animal Crossing], a hit game for the Gamecube that was released in 2002. This version of The Sims is more focused on urban culture. All of the Urbz are devided into different groups, each with their own 'district'. There are around 9 groups on the GCN, PS2, and Xbox systems that include but are not limited to the sk8ers of Kicktail Park.
