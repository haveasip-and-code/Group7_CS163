syd barrett
(Roger Keith Barrett) The former front man of the psychadelic force known as Pink Floyd. In his late teens and early twenties he was exposed to fame, hard drugs and a difficult lifestyle. His genious emanates from his songs done with Pink Floyd and as a solo artist. Syd created music that was so abstract and transcendent that it is often misunderstood for a bunch of drug generated bullshit. If you feel the same way, then i feel bad for you... because you're a complete shithead.
