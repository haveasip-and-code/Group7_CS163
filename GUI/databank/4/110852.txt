the world is quiet here
the awesome slogan for VFD: ; When we grab you by the ankles, ; Where our mark is to be made, ; You'll soon be doing noble work, ; Although you won't be paid. ; When we drive away in secret, ; You'll be a volunteer, ; So don't scream when we tell you: ; The world is quiet here.'
