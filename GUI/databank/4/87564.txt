The dialectic pronounciation of 'Canton, Ohio,' one of the most insipid cities in the country. basically, the Northern Ohio accent is a Chicago accent, but lazier. So people their make all their vowels flat, such as 'mahm, get me a pahp!' but they don't use the Chicago lilt. They also randomly drop syllables.
