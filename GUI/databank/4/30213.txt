whore
An insulting term for a sexually loose woman, derived from the old English word hora (from the Indo-European root ka; meaning 'to like, desire'), so 'whore' could be translated as 'pleasurer'. ; Also another word for a prostitute (strangely, while 'whore' is considered a [pejorative] word in the English-speaking world, in Germany the organizations of prostitutes use the word Hure (whore) on purpose since they feel that prostitute is an unnecessary euphemism for something that doesn't need any euphemisms.)
