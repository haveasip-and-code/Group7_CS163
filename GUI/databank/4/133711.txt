Central Bucks West
Central Bucks High School West is the social counterpart to CB East. We may have money but we're too busy spending it all on pot unlike the east kids who blow it on alcohol and hollister shirts. (See [pop the collar] day) Generally everyone at west is pretty friendly and you can see people dealing at lunch with a smile. We go to town, have parties, and get baked and we love it.
