Gripfast
The best damn boots in the world. ; With the fall of Doc Martin's (as they're now being made in China, and their quality is slowly diminishing) these boots have been making a steep rise on the industrial, skinhead and punk scene. ; Steel toed boots made by White & Co., a family business that started over 100 years ago (1890). ; They're considered the best in British military, police and work. ; Full grain leather uppers, year welted constuction and set on an an original UK army last .22mm Commando Double Sole, reinforced with screws. ; These boots are made for kicking ass and blazing through the backstreets of the city. ; I wear my Gripfasts every day.
