kau-klauber
A type of metaphor in which the relation between tenor and vehicle is so tenuous that the teen agent has left the slaughterhouse, so to speak. Elvis and abattoir recline in agist spurge, a cow cannot understand the bolt before the blow, i.e. ante-cere-bellum-blown-out -- the serendippitydo-dah of the youngering 70s killdren slayed and escapaded before a klein of narrative nippledumb. Thens the phrase, 'cow clobber metaphor.'
