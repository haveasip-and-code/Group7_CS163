Rocky
there is an old naval saying about being put into the barrell. This involved a seaman being put into a barrell with a hole in it and then fucked around the deck by the other seaman. He was put in the barrell so that he could not been seen by the others and he could not see who is abusers were. The person put in the barrell was a called a 'Rocky'. This practice was especially prelevant on pirate ships.
