Jewography
A favored game of those of the Jewish faith, Jewography was born due to the phenomenon that most Jews can get connected in less than six degrees. Though it is usually played at [USY] conventions/summer programs, it is possible to play it wherever a group of geographically diverse Jews is gathered to eat and schmooze.
