wie schade
A German phrase meaning 'what a shame' and the equivilent of the French 'quel dommage'. When used, it is in a sarcastic tone to show sympathy which is not there. It can be accompanied by a raised eyebrow, and is best put to use after a particularly long and boring story that someone has just told. It helps if they don't know what you're talking about. ; NB: pronounced 'vee shaadeh.'
