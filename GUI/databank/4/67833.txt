Gotengo
An 'undersea battleship' that is capable of aerial flight and can drill underground as well. The Gotengo is an icon of Japanese science-fiction cinema, originally appearing in ATRAGON (1963) where it annihilated an undersea empire and battled the snake god Manda. In GODZILLA FINAL WARS (2004) it is destroyed in a battle with Godzilla, but later rebuilt just in time to take on aliens from Planet X. ; The Gotengo also made an appearance (as the Gohten) in THE WAR IN SPACE (1977). In this film, essentially the Japanese answer to STAR WARS, it was portrayed as a spaceship which traveled to Venus in order to end the threat of an alien menace.
