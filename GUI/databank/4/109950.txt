Redcliffe
A place in Bristol, England. Redcliffe has an amazing Church (St Mary Redcliffe). At even more importantly it has the best Secondary school in the City. St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School. A Church of England School, paid for by the Dioscise of Bristol, and the various socitys which were setup by it founders. ; Amazingly the School has links to the Priory of Sion (and the Grail Mysteries), via the Kinghts of the Temple (Templar Nights), whom helped to found the origional school many hundreds of years ago. ; But now (06/2005) all is changing, its like the changing of the Guards. The important people of Redcliffe's history are leaving the school, not only its Head David McGregor, but its best teacher Mr Ed Johnstone, and its too star pupils James and Tony!! As one of the goveneres said 'Its the end of an era!' ; -== ; FACT ; Redcliffe Hill was the first place in bristol to be bombed in the Blitz. And a tram track from bedmister still lies stuck in the Church Yard to comemorate the dead.
