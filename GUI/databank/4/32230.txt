a game played by teens and young adults between two people. (male and female most commonly but also played by female and female and male and male) the first player must touch the other player somewhere and after every new place the first player touches the second player, they must ask, 'Do you feel violated?' and if the second player says 'no' the first player must keep touching except in a different place. if the second player says 'yes' they do feel violated, the first player must stop and its the second players turn to touch. when they say 'do u feel violated', they mean, when i touch u here am i violating where you want to be touched?
