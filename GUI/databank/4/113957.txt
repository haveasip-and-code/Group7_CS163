Dirty water dog
An NYC delicacy -- NOT -- for the tourists. You have to know WHO dips their dogs for the LEAST time -- AND buys the good meat. But yeah, the water's turbid. Soooooo, nice, and JUST the right 'snap.' ; Don't know what I'm talking about? This ain't your Oscar Meyer wieeeeeener. Go to McDonald's, that's your speed.
