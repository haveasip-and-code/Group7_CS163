let it ride
A casino game popular in Las Vegas, each player receives 3 cards, and the dealer receives 2 community cards. Players can make up to 3 bets to begin, and may rescind 2 of those bets based on the strength of their hand. The game is not played 'against' the dealer, per se, in order to win you generally must have at least a pair of tens.
