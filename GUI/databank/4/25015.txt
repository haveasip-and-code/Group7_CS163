paise
Smallest and now defunct unit of currency in india. ; 100 paise = 1 rupee ; 6 paise = 1 anna. ; hence 24 paise = 4 anna, but the one paise gets added usually, and a 25 paise coin is known as a charanna or a chavanni. ; Therefore a 50 paise coin is known as an athanna, or an attanni, but the word has been bastardised into adhanna, meaning half an anna, which does not make sense.
