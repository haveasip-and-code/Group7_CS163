muscle car
its a bunch of old cars owned by hicks / hillbillies / cowboys and trailer trash people .... ; the car gots all sort of power, and are gas guzzlers , but they lack in technology and efficency. they are good in going in straight roads , but are shit on cornering and taking turns ; a [muscle] car is basically any 2 doored / big engine car whihc is made in noth america ..... ; i would say they are complete pile of shit and they have no chance against the japanese skylines or european mclaren on a track
