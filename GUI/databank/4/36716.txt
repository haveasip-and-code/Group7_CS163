PRDQP
An Italian phrase, 'Poche Ragazze Da Quelle Parti', first used in the popular Disney comic 'PKNA - Paperinik New Adventures'. It means 'Few girls over there', and was used by the editorial team to draw attention towards a particularly geeky or sad letter/comment. ; Still used today on #PkChat.
