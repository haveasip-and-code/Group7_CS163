coyote ugly
adj. the third and final phase of sheer unattractiveness. ; Phase 1-(one-bagger) so ugly you need to bag her/his face so you can't see it. ; Phase 2-(two-bagger) so damned ugly that you bag your face as well, in case the first bag falls off. ; Phase 3-(coyote ugly) so hideously ugly that you imitate the action of a trapped coyote and chew off your arm rather than face your 'conquest' from the night before.
