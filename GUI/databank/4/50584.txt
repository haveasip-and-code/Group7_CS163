black panthers
An oft-misunderstood Black Power group that was NOT black nationalist, black racist, or anti-white. They were devoted to the self-defense and self-sufficiencyh of black communities, and they attracted sympathy and support from the white Left in the 1960s. Dismantled through illicit means in the early 1970s by the FBI's COINTELPRO operations, which assassinated Panther leaders and imprisoned others on trumped-up charges.
