Hillsborough
A sad, sad city in New Jersey. Mostly rich caucasians reside here. Everyone thinks just because you live here you're made of money. Think Again. Also, many of the whites try to act 'black' or 'hispanic' to try and fit in with the few minorities that attend the schools. The rest are all preppy people that walk around in american eagle polos with their 'collars popped' looking 'pimp'. SUPPOSABLY.
