international superhits
kick-ass CD by Green day that features most of their greatest hits from 1994-2001, such as Basket case, Welcome to paradise, time of your life and Warning. Sadly, the released songs from Shenanigans and American idiot can't be on there coz they weren't even written when this album came out. It also features three new songs and has a homosexual-ish album cover, but I don't give a shit.
