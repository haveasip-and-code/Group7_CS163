Markleville
A quaint farming community in east-central Indiana. Location of the killing of innocent Native Americans, wherby the murderers were hung at Fall Creek in Pendleton in an oak tree that stands to this day. Most recently Markleville is home to the 2005 state cross country champion, Brock Hagerman. Was also home to the largest hardware store east of the Mississippi for sometime.
