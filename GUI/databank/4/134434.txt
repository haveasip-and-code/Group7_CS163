Malaysia
A pluralistic country comprising Malays (majority), Chinese, Indians and minority aborigines. About 70 percent of the non-malays(mostly Chinese) here constantly whinge about being oppressed by the evil bigot mud-people whilst making derogatory racial remarks about the Malays themselves. You need not look further than this page as proof of their hypocrisy. If they don't drown on their way swimming to Communist Singapore, I hope the irony they presented here is enough to choke the living shit out of their life. This is why God made Singapore, to segregate us from these fucks.
