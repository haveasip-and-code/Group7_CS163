Pawned
Many people attack 'pawned' as a misspelling of 'pwned', but it has, in fact, become an acceptable spelling. The original origin of the word 'pwn' was a typo, probably from a high-speed chat, of the word 'own'. Think how 'the' is now 'teh' in traditional l337 internet slang. In any case, looking at the origins of the word 'own,' one could deduce that it implies some dominance over something or someone. When 'own' and 'owned' became 'pwn', 'pwned' and 'pwnage', the words came to mean the same thing; dominance and superiority. The new word 'pawn' is very simmilar in the sense; its plain definition is to belittle or reduce someone or something to pawn status, essentially, 'owning' them.
