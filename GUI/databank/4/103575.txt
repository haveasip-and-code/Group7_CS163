Turbo Burbo
This is the ancient art of downing shots of tropical juice for no reason at all. One must consume a 2 litre bottle of tropical juice, each shot being taken without any sort of break. Once this has been performed they may assume the role turbo burbo! The name may be shortened to 'Turbo'.
