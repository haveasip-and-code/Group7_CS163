SOuth Africa
Influenced by the Africaan/Dutch origins, Seth Efricans have a MAJOR chip on their shoulder. Stereotyped as arrogant and aggressive they certainly live up to the image...and are notoriuosly racist.....not to mention the most disgraceful accent on planet earth, sounds as God spent the seventh day taking the english language and putting it in a blender instead of resting....
