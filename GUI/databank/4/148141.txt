To have everything in the world handed to you, despite neither deserving nor earning any of it and then throwing it away, all while ruining other's lives. Becoming a running joke and existing solely as a caution to others not to emulate you. To rise to mediocrity and pseudo-celebrity status, only to fall back into the depths of obscurity long before your fifteen minutes have expired. In short: to blow it.
