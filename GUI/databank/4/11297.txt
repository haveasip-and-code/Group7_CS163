Brea
Derived from the word bi-atch. Meaning fake friend and horrible girlfriend. ; Friendships- loved by many (too many if you ask me). Homecoming queen, what? Um definetely quantity not quality in this case. No good friends here. DO NOT BUG HER. She will not tell you about herself WELL NOT IMPORTANT STUFF, and when she does, do not believe it. Cause even if she says it is everything, IT ISNT!!!! IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR EFFORT> ; Relationships: Good luck to the bf. Do not say the horrible four letter wordAHHHHHHH! She either wont mean it, or wont say it back. Only one person matters in the relationship. And the name starts with a 'B' Um, dont make long term plans, It is def. a 'day-to-day' thing. Beautiful girl, awesome personality. Why didn't she have more boyfriends? 'One-date-wonder' what? Marriage is not for this girl! She only lives for herself!! ; Strengths- Pretending to be happy-being a 'friend'-leading guys on- avoiding phone calls-doing stuff for herself- Um gorgeous girl-be careful no one knows what she looks like under her clothes. ; Weaknesses-Um probably sex. being a girlfriend. being a friend.
