Ocean City NJ
No bars = 'dry' town = complete bore. More kids and families than hot girls in bikinis (although many of the lifegurads are extremely goodlooking -- dated one myself:). People who live in OC end up having to go to Margate or SIC (Sea Isle City) or Avalon for a drink and Atlantic City for any fun. A Night in Venice is completely overrated. It's a family town so expect to see lots of Moms with their kids, loads of PA tags, and yep, it is DEAD in the winter.
