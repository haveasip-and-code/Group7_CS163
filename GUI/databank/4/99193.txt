Atomic Rooster
Band formed by Vincent Crane and Carl Palmer, keyboardist and tour drummer for The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, respectively. Gravitating toward a kind of progressive funk, the band enjoyed some early success but is largely remembered as Carl Palmer's previous band, if that. 'Death Walks Behind You' is considered a classic of hard rock by many familiar with it.
