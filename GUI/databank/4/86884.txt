libertarianism
Modern philosophy of government closley resembling Classic Liberalism, a philosophy of government which stresses liberties (economic and civil). ; Libertarianism is a term for a philosophy that promotes liberty, i.e. freedom, which includes the civil freedoms to be prejudice, greedy, hateful, ect., and the economic freedom to be rich, buy anything, sell anything, have total rights over all private property. Thus Libertarianism CANNOT, BY DEFINITION, be socialism. ; Libertarianism is the absolute most ethical form of government, specifically because it allows individuals to believe and practice what ever they want, such as live in exclusive socialist communities. Capitolism is not an economic system; it is the lack thereof, thus allowing any group of people to do anything to which the included people consent. This is unlike socialism, which requires everyone to participate, even if it is against that individual's will.
