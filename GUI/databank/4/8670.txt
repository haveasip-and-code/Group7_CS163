Eye-Humper
A person who [Eye-Hump]s others. Is often also a [Butter Golem] or otherwise resembles a living, drooling mass of pizza dough. Eye-Humpers usually develop eyestrain due to all the eye-humping they do, forcing them to wear inch-thick glasses, which unfortunately only serves to enhance the creepyness of the Eye-Humper. ; The term 'Eye-Hump' originates from an episode of Family Guy in which Peter Griffin complains that 'every guy in the room is eye-humping my wife.' The term 'Eye-Humper' was first used by either me or one of my friends in reference to pasty mass of flesh who eye-humped me throughout my Junior year of High School. 'The Eye-Humper' is used as a suffix after the given name or nickname. 'Elmo the Eye-Humper,' for example.
