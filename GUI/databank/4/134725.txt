Bramble Scramble
Either while camping, or just out in the middle of no where, and having no other options, one is forced to crap in the woods. Impress friends by using this in everyday vocabulary. ; p.s.-even though you will be proud of yourself for being independent of the john, steer clear of wiping leaves that resemble poison oak,sumac,ivy, you aren't superman.
