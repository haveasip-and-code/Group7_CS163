binghamton
The cloudiest and grayest city in the country, like Seattle but without any culture, full of horrible people from all walks of life. It used to be a booming industrial town, now it's a rust belt refuse. You meet a new breed of asshole here, the upstate asshole. The upstate asshole likes to hunt, thinks that making potatoe launchers and tipping cows is fun. The upstate asshole males and females only know how to have fun by drinking the lowest quality of beer in large quantities because there is absolutely nothing to do here besides get wasted and puke, hoping that they can forget how miserable it is to be here. Full of trash, criminals, hunters, bible-thumpers and just overall ignorance; this town is representative of a lot of what is wrong with this country as a whole. Many people from the city, Long Island and other 'downstate' areas choose to go to the SUNY at Binghamton because it has a good reputation and is about twenty thousand dollars cheaper than the other schools they got into. ; Muddy. Expect every pair of shoes to be ruined.
