Montco
A suburbian county in southeast Pennsylvania Montco (short for Montgomery County) borders Philadelphia to the northwest. Filled with a wide range of people, Montco has everything from upscale mansions (Blue Bell, Gwynedd Valley) to high-rises and cardboard boxes (Norristown, Conshohocken). This should not be confused with Montgomery County, Maryland, who's abbreviation is the much more feminine[moco].
