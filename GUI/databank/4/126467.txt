WRITER
An induvidual who practices Graffiti Art. A writer dedicates himself to proving his daring and skill by getting his/her name in the hardest to reach/most well seen places. Writers often piece/bomb/burn billboards, dridges and freight trains. ; Writers are often skaters/snowboarders. ; If you just draw shit on paper, you are not a graffiti artist or a writer. You may have the skill to draw it, but it is another thing to have the can control to make it happen on a wall, and to have enough balls to climb a 60 foot rickety ladder and express your feelings on a billboard.
