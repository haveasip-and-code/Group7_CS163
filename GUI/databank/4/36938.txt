madalion
1. noun - a person who studies the sacred art of madalion ; 2. noun - a type of martial arts, based on strategy(including strange mental concepts), AEEP (agility energy efficiency power), and superiority. It normally takes about 10 years to become a true madalion, usually referred to as 'One True Madalion'. Something called a thought cube is involved, I find it highly confusing and meaningless. Finding someone who is a madalion is extremely hard(for me atleast). In theory, it originated from a arabian man and a chinese man getting into a fight, then becoming freinds. This happened sometime between 400->3000 years ago, and none of the madalions I've met can agree. Sometimes madalion is thought of as a religion.
