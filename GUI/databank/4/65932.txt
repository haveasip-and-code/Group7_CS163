cool kids
A bunch of kids who are popular at school. Usually very snotty and arrogant and call themselves either 'PUNK' or 'GANGSTAZ' and usually are white suburban kids who think they are black street kids. They usually go around with G-Unit shirts, 'BLING BLING', acting 'propa hard'. They usually hate rock music 'because it ain't gangsta like us'. See [popular] and [jock].
