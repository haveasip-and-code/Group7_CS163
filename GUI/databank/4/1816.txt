SBC (Senior Bacon Cheeseburger)
Anyone familiar with the fast food chain Wendys is most likely also familiar with the JBC, or junior bacon cheeseburger. Costing only 99 cents apiece, these babies give the average joe by far the best bang for his(or her) buck. The SBC is two JBC's stacked, and then flattened to fit in the mouth. Some modifications include a layer of ketchup or mayo between the two burgers, but really anything is possible. This invention is thought to have originated in the East Coast state of Maryland, somewhere near the town of Elkridge, by a MR. C...but its origins are not definitely known.
