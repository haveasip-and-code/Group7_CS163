payvand
a, at the moment, 16 and 9 month old fob, living in mountain view. he spends his days nonchalantly flipping through various lexicons in order to burgeon his knowledge. in his free time, he likes to study ancient philosophy, and sometimes, assemble wooden tables. ultimately, he is the last member of SNAP.
