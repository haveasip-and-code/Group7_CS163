Raelians
A group of peoples that believe that an alien came down from the heavens, landed on a volcano, gave their (now) leader the name rael, and believe that their mission in life is to clone human beings so that the human race will continue on. Probably will end up drinking toxic kool-aid so that they can meet the aliens coming behind the comet in the sky.
