cutester
a member of the opposite sex (hopefully the word is not prone to drift in the homosexual domain) who appears physically attractive whom you would like to pursue. It is different than 'hot' or 'hott' as that simply denotes a desire for copulation, whereas a cutester denotes more noble or perhaps sensual desires or emotions.
