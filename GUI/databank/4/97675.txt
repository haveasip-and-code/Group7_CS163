Grant Schweikert
Manager of a popular fast food store. His 'keep it [gangsta]' mentality and '[ghetto]' lifestyle, combined with his '[sick]' cars and erratic driving, have earned him an infamous reputation with the local police force. However, he is not a [white cap]. Grant has lost his driver's licence at least four times, in the approximate four years he has had it. Grant is also a bum-buddy of [Tim Blackwood]. The pair together, are literally thick as thieves, and living proof that sodomy should be illegal. Grant has also been nominated for Australian Idol 347 times.
