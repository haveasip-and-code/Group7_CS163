scottsdale
This wonderful city has beautiful views over looking the entire valley and terrific 10,000 sq/ft homes that come with it. There are many reasons why [Scottsdale] is one of the nicest cities in the U.S. one being its location. Where else can you be 2 hours from snow, 4 hours from [Mexico], 6 hours from [San Diego] beaches, and have 340 days of wonderful sun a year? I am from Scottsdale and I am not a snob. I work hard to keep my $6,000 Jeep running and even though there are people with rediculous amounts of money, I still have yet to run into a snob. Everyone that I've met with 6 digit incomes are gratious and welcoming and happy toplease you too.
