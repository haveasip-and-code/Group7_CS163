southerner
An individual who lives in the southern United States. Nasal-voiced northerners insist that all southerners are inbred, ignorant hicks, but in truth it's the northerners (see [Yankee]s) who are the ignorant ones. ; A true southerner is moralistic, kind, practices [southern hospitality], has an actual sense of humor, and sees more to life than rushing around in a city all day. Come on people, sit back and drink some lemonade or something.
