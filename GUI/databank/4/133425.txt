DBZ
The acronym for Dragonball Z, it is the only anime whose viewing audience does not primarily consist of nerds and losers. A large portion of its viewers are actually 'cool' (by meaning of social standards). As a matter of fact, quite a few fans of the series are unfamiliar with the term '[anime]'.
