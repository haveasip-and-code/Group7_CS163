neo-Communist
A Neo-Communist per.se is pretty easy to define and hard at the same time. ; Why this is so: As the word implies, it is a 'new' generation of [Communist], albeit most are students (as where it learned from), few are more and less anti-Authitorian proletars (low class workers), and pledge alliance to Marx's theories, but defy [Soviet] and the like (China, perhaps Cuba) as inferior attempts on it, not genuine ones, and state-capitalistic enterprises with vague socialistic elements. They often share sympathies with workers, activists and anarchists. Most neo-Communist are so presumably because of a rebellish fad, or attitude, but most of them reject [Totalarianism], saying it was never a part of leftism. Transistionary states are a heated subject, and neo-Communists are often followed for their ideology, because they are placed in the same class of despot-supporters. Neo-Communists are often atheists or agnostics. ; Most of these frequent [RevLeft.com], and are born at most in the 70's or up.
