Rose
n. a term used in Florida (at least), and usually in convenience store type settings, for the 4 inch long glass tube that features a tiny plastic rose inside but is known by all, including the authorities, to really be intended for use as a crack cocaine smoking pipe. (A Tampa newscaster recently shocked many by presenting an expose on the sale of 'roses' from behind the counters of several small grocery stores!)
