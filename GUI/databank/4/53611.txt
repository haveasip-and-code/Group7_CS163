Jeff Foxworthy
1. A popular comedian among NASCAR fans, mulletheads, Pabst Blue Ribbon drinkers and rednecks (like those are different categories). Creator of the 'You Might Be A Redneck' series of jokes. I say 'jokes' loosely, as they're all slight derivations of the exact same joke, which isn't really a joke to begin with, just observation: rednecks lack class & intelligence. The only humor is that the rednecks themselves love this joke more than anyone. 'We're backwards losers, that is SOOOO funny!' ; 2. Any one-trick pony such as definition 1.
