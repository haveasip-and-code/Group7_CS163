UMCP
1. A school where a freshman is bilked for as much money as possible before being shuffled off campus - usually without any idea of where to live - should he DARE to stick around until he is an upperclassman. ; 2. A school where the people who run it waste money like gibbering jackasses. ; 3. A school that purchases several $2 million dollar tour busses for the basketball team - which they will then refuse to use. ; 4. A geographical location wherein the people who give parking violations and the personal servants of the Devil may or may not be the same people - the actual facts are still hotly debated.
