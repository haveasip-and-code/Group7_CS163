latin
The majority of people who have written definitions of the word 'Latin', that refers to the nationality are wrong. Times have changed and now the word latin and latino refers only to those who live in Latin American, not Europe. The majority of countries that are in Latin America speak Spanish except Brazil where the people speak portuguese, but they are still considered Latin. The people from Spain, that are located in Europe are NOT latin, because they are not located in Latin American, but they are [Hispanic]. All latinamericans except brazilians are [hispanic], because they speak [spanish]. ; Neither Jamaica, nor Guam and some countries that are located in the Caribbean and in the North of South America are Latin. All the countries that are located in Central America are latin. The only countries that are latin in the Caribbean are Puerto Rico, Cuba and Dominic Republic. Not Jamaica nor Haiti. ; Times have changed. The language latin is barely used to communicate everyday in the whole world, so there is no reason to call the Italians, French and other europeans latin, unless they were born in a Latin American and moved over there.
