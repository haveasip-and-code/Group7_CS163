paganism
A vaguely defined term from the Latin word Poganus meaning countryman that has become an umbrella term for a group of reconstructed pre-Christian beliefs systems which are often nature centred. Followers of these belief systems share a wide variety of beliefs as these beliefs systems tend not to be formally structured and very focused on individual spirituality. Their beliefs can be polytheistic, animistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, bitheistic, nontheistic or a mixture of the former. Alternatively and less confusingly the term Neopagan can be used as the term has also been used for centuries as a derogotory term for any non-Abramic belief system.
