pourn
it's mostly like the past tense of 'pour' except for it's better than 'poured' and should only be used with, like, a helper verb... like 'had' or 'have' or something. pretty much only a few people, mostly florida crackers, say it like that. wisconsinites definitely don't, and make fun of us for it.
