Jason X
A terrible movie. Here's a rundown of the story: ; Jason is frozen in an ice chamber thing. ; Centuries later, he is thawed out, and goes around killing dumbasses from the future. ; Somehow, Jason becomes mechanically enhanced, therefore he can now kill people while looking even more like an idiot. ; Jason dies in a duel with a stereotypical black guy while being blown up in an exploding ship. ; Never see this movie.
