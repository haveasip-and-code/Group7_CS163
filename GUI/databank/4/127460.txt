Paradox Sector
A nifty forum online that is better then [Totse] where cool people can discuss cool stuff. It even has it's own themesong, Porn crackers, and some really awesome moderators. And hot chicks, funny people, some text articles, creative artists, druggies, and stuff. It was founded by the admin Enigma on the 27th of October 2004, and has a relatively small user base, which allows the weeding out of the occasional [troll] ; ParadoxSector.com
