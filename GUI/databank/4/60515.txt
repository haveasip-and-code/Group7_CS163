dirty air
The air that is expelled from an anus before, during or after excretion. Or entirley on its own. The 'dirty air' is usually warm to hot in temperature(about 60-70degreesC), and can be seen on cold days as a vapour cloud that is brownish in colour. Speeds recorded of dirty air have exceeded over 600 mph, over the speed of sound!
