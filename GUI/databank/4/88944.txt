Billigan
A do-over shot in golf, synonymous with 'mulligan,' invented and perfected by former US President Bill Clinton. Clinton, who professed to play by the rules of golf repeatedly as president, routinely takes as many as 100 extra shots per 18 holes of golf, according to the bestselling book, 'First Off the Tee,' by Don Van Natta Jr. The way Mr. Clinton does it is this: He tees off twice, or even three times, off a tee, then gets out to the fairway and asks his playing partners which ball was his first shot. This is the shot he is supposed to play. Inevitably, his playing partners point to the ball closest to the flag, and often that is Mr. Clinton's second or third tee shot. A billigan is a do-over golf shot awarded by complicit fellow golfers who act as co-conspirators in the act of cheating.
