Joshua Savarese
A 15-year-old high school Italian kid who refers to Doom 3's console as a 'Cheat Menu'. He enjoys spouting out random and sometimes backwards words from his meaningless scumbucket of a mouth. He's worthless. He'll never amount to anything. His opinion doesn't matter. No one likes him. He has no friends. He'll join ROTC.
