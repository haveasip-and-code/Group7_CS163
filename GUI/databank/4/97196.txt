Pambo
[Pambo] n. - Rambo's second cousin, Pambo, also known as The Great Pambo, is well known throughout New England for being a man of many talents. Pambo fears nothing, and lives his life day by day, keeping the streets clean from scum like pimps, crime lords, and especially his arch-nemesis, The Midget-Clown Boy. Pambo has been highly trained in skills such as Karate, rapping, break dancing, ultimate frisbee, flying, cooking a mean steak, telekenisis, and of course, seducing the ladies. To those he respects, Pambo is one of the most generous, charming, caring, and friendly members of the Greek/Jewish Mafia you could meet. But take this as a warning, crossing the line with Pambo could result putting you and your entire family in great danger and/or misfortune. ; Posted by Pambo
