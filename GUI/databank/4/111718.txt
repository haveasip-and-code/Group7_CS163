faux-ho
n. One who dresses the part of being 'artsy' (or [bohemian]) so as to impress one's friends/classmates. One trademark of faux-ho fashion is buying pre-distressed or paint-splattered jeans at a higher price than normal jeans to show that they shop at thrift stores or are artists, respectively. Another is having a simplistic liberal ideology (i.e. Bush is a moron. Bush stole the election. etc.) that manifiests itself in the wearing of t-shirts with 'edgy' slogans such as 'Every vote counts, if you count every vote!' Many think Iran-Contra was a video game. ; see [poser]
