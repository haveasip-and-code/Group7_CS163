clicktrance
A degenerate state of computer usage where you stop caring about accomplishing anything or bettering yourself in any way. The only thing that remains is to click on random hyperlinks in your browser, look at the similarly random pages they link to, then click on something else and forget everything you just saw. Can also refer to similarly meaningless clicking in games like [minesweeper]. ; Used a couple of times on boingboing.net, which as we all know, must make it a legitimate term.
