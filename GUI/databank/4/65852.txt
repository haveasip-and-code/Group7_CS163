bellevue
A hella tizzite city in Washington where all the true gangsters live. We lay low in our mercedes and bently's, and get some good food at Cheesecake Factory. All the coool bellevue bitches live on Cougar Mountain, and attend Issaquah High School, whereas all the lame-asses attend some other bellevue high school. Official saying in B-town: 'Yo, im white. But i'll pop u one if u mess up my AF1's. Take that biatch!'
