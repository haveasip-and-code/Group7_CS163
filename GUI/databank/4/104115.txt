Cloud Strife
Cloud is the main hero in the smash RPG hit, [Final Fantasy VII]. One of the most recognizable figures in RPG-land, Cloud possesizes a head of spikey blonde hair and a large buster sword. In the FF-fandom, there is a large dispute over the love triangle between Cloud, [Aeris], and [Tifa]. It's up to the player's discretion, given that the game is open to interpreation, but Square seems to love pairing Cloud and Aeris off together in cameos, don't they? *wink* Believing himself to be an ex-SOLDIER, Cloud sets out on what becomes a voyage of self-discovery as he saves the world from his old friend, [Sephiroth].
