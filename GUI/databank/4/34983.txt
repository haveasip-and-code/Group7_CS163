The answer for poor but cultured people's true hatred of [bud light] beer and the rednecks that drink it. It was born of natural ingredients, and still a smooth refreshing beer (not really but damn its cheap). Also a status symbol among elitist [dub-v] born males trying to make a better name for their state.
