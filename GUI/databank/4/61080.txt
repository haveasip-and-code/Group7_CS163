Squirrel Hill  Pittsburgh
This neighborhood in Pittsburgh is by far the best neighborhood to live in. Everyone knows everyone and the drama between friends is crazy. All groups of friends know each other and party together yet they all hate each other on the inside. You either belong to Beth Shalom or aren't Jewish but everyone thinks you are. Everyone is rich here and shows off their money with huge partys for their bar/bat mitzvah. Parents think their kids are little angels and will give them whatever they want, and the kids like it this way. ; Overall, the best place to live!
