censor
1: A useless act used by parents all over the world to hover over their child's every action on the internet, tv, and when playing video games, only to realize that their child is going to end up learning about what you dubbed 'innapropriate' in past years. ; 2: The person who decides if a tv show or video game is appropriate for the market the producers are aiming for. If swearing or innuendo gets by, it is often dubbed over with obnoxious silence, obnoxious beeps, or obnoxious blurs.
