anis
Aggravated Nipple Syndrome or ANIS. Unusually over-used nipples. Symptoms include chafing, chapping, and the occasional pustule. Some rare cases of ANIS have left the victim's nipples in an aroused state for months and are sometimes accompanied by a yellowish discharge with a pungent odor that has been compared to rotting fish. ANIS can cause elevated stress levels that typically cause the sufferer to flail their arms about in a pathetic attempt to scare the person or persons responsible for the onset of ANIS.
