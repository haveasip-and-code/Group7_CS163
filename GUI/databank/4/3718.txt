The Captain
Captain Tenneal (AKA The Skipper): A crucial character/host on the Most Extreme Elimination Challenge (MXC). He brings a necessary balance to the game by exploiting his authoritative role and using his philanthropic abilities in his dialog to improve the human condition (usually at the expense of the game's participants). His mental salvos of motivational verse can really light a fire under players, encouraging them to push on... bringing structure and continuity and to the game.
