Crushes one develops on another's intellectual fortitude that, while occasionally pursuable, are not actively pursued due to the inherent irrationality of said longings -- and the fact you don't talk to him/her in real life or, well, at all. Targets often include former MIT linguistics professors and random guys who write for scholarly/incredibly esoteric publications, and maybe you.
