color guard
A group of girls (or guys) who are very talented! They spin, toss, and dance alongside of the marching band. They have to remember several tough routines, know the exact counts, and march to their exact spots on the field. People may not realize it, but a there are a lot of hot guard girls. Most people just stare at them. Oh and by the way, it is actually a sport unlike cheerleading.
