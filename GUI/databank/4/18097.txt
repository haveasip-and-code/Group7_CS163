mleh
Mleh, was in fact, contrary to popular belief and the person above this definition, made up in a small conversation between two stunningly good looking and intelligent people in malvern. I wont mention Names but they know who they are. The person who thinks they invented the word mleh, must have heard it in a conversation after it spread out in great waves from malvern and should not be blamed for thinking they invented it although one of the people who REALLY invented it may or may not be of the opinion that anyone who thinks that they may have invented it should be severely repremanded. ; The word mleh is a short word that can be used in any way, if someone says something you dont agree with but you think tht if u disagree they'll think you're sad you say mleh. If someone asks you a long boring question tht requires a long boring answer you say mleh. If someone is trying to split up with you and you feel like having a chuckle at their expense(serves them right for dumping you) say mleh! MLEH!
