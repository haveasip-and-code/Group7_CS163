J-rock
Mostly crappy rock music. It's Japanese rock music hince the J for Japanese. Most of the 'singers' dress like women and follow the 70's glam rock idea. Although the music not lyrics are alright most of the lyrics when translated into english or even read in Japanese don't make sence. It's about as coharent as J-Rap and equaly bad.
