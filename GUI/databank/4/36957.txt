walk on warrior
Any guy who joins a collegiate athletic team (with out a scholarship) in the hopes of living out a dream while slaying mad box and making his overbearing father happy. A walk on usually sustains massive amounts of abuse for the greater glory without ever seeing the field of play. And still pays for his schooling on his own. ; Step below supreme Div-1 athletes but better then frat guys.
