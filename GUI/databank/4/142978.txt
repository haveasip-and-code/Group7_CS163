AOHELLese
AOHELLese consists of slang acronyms that were once specific only to the [AOHELL] service itself. Many AOHELLese terms originated with the purpose of saving keystrokes in [AOHELL] chat rooms and Instant Messages, (for example, 'IM' for 'Instant Message', 'YGM' for 'You've Got Mail', 'YGP' for 'You've Got Pictures', etc.).
