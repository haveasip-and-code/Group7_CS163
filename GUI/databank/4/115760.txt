Thug Wanabe
A person who is typically white or suburban, who tries to be street/black/mexican by listening to hip/hop, getting a tattoo, acting tough, and avoiding responsibility well into their 30's. They spend their lives acting 'bad' and trying to scare regular citizens but never really cross the line into serving longterm prison terms which is what 'bad' people end up doing. Confirms the idea that how 'bad'someone is depends on who you compare them to, most people have a line they won't cross.
