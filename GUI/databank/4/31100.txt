dirrty
Basically, this is a word straight from the Lou (St Louis), as am I so I know what I'm talking about. It was popularized by Nelly, pretty much the first artist to make it big from around here. (And it's not heeeere, but if you're saying herre...well.. you know you just need the stl accent.) ; Anyway it means: Homie, pal, friend, brother.. anything like that.
