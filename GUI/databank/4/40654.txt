Foopskyp
Foopskyp was a game invented by Josh Cutler, Sam Utz, and Cubbiss. You lay down on the ground in a room that has a ceiling and a lamp. Then you take a yoga ball (big round ball) and kick it at the cieling. First one to break the lamp wins. There are no rules, just kick the ball and the ceiling and pray it lands on your lamp.
