grass roots blogging
1. The act of [blogging] for the self (i.e. a personal blog), not for income. ; 2. The act of [blogging] for the masses, but not specifically for the income potential of the entries (i.e. interesting, thoughtful entries that are not specifically written to draw higher-paying advertisements and cost-per-click rates).
