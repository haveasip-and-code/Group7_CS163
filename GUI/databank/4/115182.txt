N.W.A.
A West Coast gangsta rap group founded in the late eighties that carried over to the early nineties. Dr. Dre was in charge, DJ Yella was the DJ, and Ice Cube, MC Ren, and Eazy E did their thang. Their best album was 'Straight Outta Compton'. Their most famous songs include 'Fuck Tha Police', 'Straight Outta Compton', 'Express Yourself', and 'Alwayz Into Somethin''. NOT the inventors of gangsta rap, since Ice T and Compton's Most Wanted kind of beat them to that. Still, N.W.A. represents gangsta rap in its heyday. Some people think they're assholes because they don't have respect for no one. Other people think they kick ass for that same precise reason. I adhere to the latter opinion. Good group. RIP EAZY.
