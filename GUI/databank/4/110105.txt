Xerith Xorncoren
The pseudonym of the writer of such amazing (yet so far unpublished) works such as 'I Am Aqueous' and many installments of 'After Images'. Xerith's works seem like fantasy on the outside, but often deal with the main character's (characters') social problems and identity crises as well as a fantasy plot. Very entertaining and accurate depictions of teen social problems (I Am Aqueous) and society's flaws (After Images).
