Toronto
Putting all that ignorant bias aside, I can safely say that being a resident of [Mississauga], the largest suburb of Toronto, has opened my eyes. I have a respect for Toronto. I have an admiration for Toronto. I have not seen [Vancouver], I have seen [Montreal], I have not seen [Halifax] or [Calgary] or [Winnipeg], or even [Edmonton], but I can tell you that they are probably as unique and wonderful as Toronto is. ; I don't understand the people that say, 'Toronto is filled with Rapists and Murderers!' .. What about [Detroit]? We don't have weekly gunplay. We have a bunch of nice bars, a bunch of nice Markets, a nice Ethnic section (that takes up 50% of Toronto) and a great little Street called Queen St. which is littered with wicked shops where you can indulge in just about anything. ; In short, Toronto -- and all Canadian cities for that matter -- is a great place to live, and certainly a nice place to visit. See you soon! ; They say that Toronto is a place to earn your living, and [Montreal] is the place to spend it. -- Just food for thought.
