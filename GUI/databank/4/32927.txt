Rom
A class of urban hipster, fond of Beatlesque 'mod' haircuts and white belts. The term is a contraction of 'Romulan', an alien race from the original Star Trek series, possesing similar stylistic hallmarks. Later iterations took up a fondness for retro sneakers, t-shirts, pants, and updated variations on plastic frame glasses reminiscent of the 50's era.
