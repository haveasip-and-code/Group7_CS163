angsty
Whining about how much your life 'sucks' even though you live in the richest nation in the world and are a pampered little while boy/girl. Usually teenagers desplay this quality of 'No one loves me or understands me'. Angsty teens often try to 'commit suicide' but are really just trying to get attention.
