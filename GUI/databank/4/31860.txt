converse
OMG THEY USED TO BE KOOL BUT NOW THEY'RE LYKE SOOO TRENDY!!!!!1!!111!11 BUT U SEE IM BEING TRENDY BY CALLING THEM TRENDY!!1111!!1 LOLZ KTHXBYE ; Shut the fuck up. Converse are amazing, always have been and always will be, no matter who wears them. If you pricks actually stop wearing a brand of shoes because 'preps' have started wearing them, you're a pathetic piece of shit and should be shot immediately. ; Converse are canvas shoes that were popular in the 1980's. In the past few years they have become more popular again. You can buy them in low or high top, and in any color or design. You can personalize them by putting in your own shoelaces and writing on them in permanent marker.
