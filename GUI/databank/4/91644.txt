latino
1) Well, it depends on who you talk to. Ignorant people just say people from Latin America are latino. But if you talk to people from Europe and Latin America, you learn that it's people of LATIN decent. AKA t3h Romanz, lolololol. ; Yes, people of LATIN decent. For example, in Europe, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and believe it or not, Romania. Of course you have like parts of Switzerland and like Southern Germany. And basically Latin America, since they were all raped by Spaniards and/or Portuguese settlers, so they're Latinos too. ; Not to be confused with HISPANIC, which is of just Spanish/Portuguese decent. Because we know they're the same because they're in the same peninsula. ; Either way, people have different definitions of what a 'Latino' person is. In short, it's a person of Latin decent. ; ANother debate is whether if Quebec becomes its own country if it would be included as part of Latin America. Seeing how it's of Latin decent, and it's in North America, I personally don't see why not. And don't say that it's entirely different from other Latin American countries, because all Latin American countries are different. Compare Argentina to Brazil. Completely different cultures. ; 2) Someone very passionate during sex. AKA Italians and French men.
