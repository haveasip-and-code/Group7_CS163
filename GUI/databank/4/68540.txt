Byzantine
The Byzantine Empire was the eastern half of the Roman Empire, which survived for a thousand years after the western half had crumbled into various feudal kingdoms and which finally fell to Ottoman Turkish onslaughts in 1453. ; The city of Byzantium grew from an ancient Greek colony founded on the European side of the Bosporus. ; In AD 330 the Roman emperor Constantine I, in an attempt to strengthen the empire, refounded Byzantium as Constantinople, the 'New Rome' and capital of the eastern half of the empire. ; At his death in 395 Emperor Theodosius I divided the empire between his two sons, and it was never reunited. ; Theodosius also made Christianity (Eastern Orthodox) the sole religion of the empire, and Constantinople assumed preeminence over other Christian centers in the East as Rome did in the West.
