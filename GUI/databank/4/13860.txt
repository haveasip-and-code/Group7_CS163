Bogan
The usual piece of shit who thinks that he is a valuable member of society for leaning out of his beaten up vehicle, (Because he lacks class, and the knowhow to get a job, and thus a higher quality car than a beaten up Ford Falcon which sounds similar to a lawn mower) and screaming out 'GO SON!' ; Other phrases apparently evident are such terms as: 'C'mon Son, You're not HARD enough!'. These sexist and somewhat smelly individuals can be seen anywhere in a Pub, boasting about how drunk they got the week before. The only danger that a Bogan will ever encounter is one involving drowing in his own vomit, yet despite all evidence, some favourable qualities must be apparent to some people. These people are clearly Boganettes, and love to be abused by sexist, chauvanistic, sport loving, unintelligent, and overall stupid men. Australian society has taken a downfall, and the Bogan population are the 'image' that is often represented as Aussie Culture. Well, this misconseption can be set straight, get these beer-swiggers of our continent, they are of no value.
