Count Olaf
Count Olaf is the very villainous, extremely evil, appallingly awful, perfectly putrid, terribly turbulent, unbeleivably unpleasant, completely corrupt, repeatedly ruthless, ineffably immoral, openly obnoxious, totally troublesome, wickedly wrong, never-endingly nasty, flagrantly foul, big-headedly bad, cunning count, who is a major character in the 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' books, and is obssessed with obtaining the vast Baudelaire fortune. Despite all of the afore-mentioned descriptions of this devilish-deed-doer, he is surprisingly sexy, as he is an evil genius with a cool tattoo (of an eye on his left ankle for all you who hav not yet been awakened to the world of Lemony Snicket and co.) who always has a scheme up his long, grubby sleeve. ; you can pretty much guarantee that any of the dodgy new characters will tun out to be him...
