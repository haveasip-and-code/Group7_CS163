wet t-shirt contest
A wet T-shirt contest is a contest where women, e.g. young college girls during spring break, are encouraged to wear a white or light-colored T-shirt without a bra. The women usually dance on a stage while being sprayed with water, which makes their T-shirts semi-transparent. Often, ice water will be used for this purpose in order to cause erect nipples, probably in order to simulate sexual arousal. Sometimes they will remove their clothing, appearing topless or even totally naked.
