Jelly Bracelets
Jelly Braceletz arn't anything for parents need to worry about. They're just something that teens like to talk about. They're not sex bracelets, like if someone brakes another persons bracelet then you have to do whatever the bracelet means w/ the person that broke it. But, we dont really do anything...its just a joke....
