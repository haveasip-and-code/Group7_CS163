Lachrymology
A religion that supposedly embraces pain, and specifically its release through crying, as a means to move to a higher state of being. ; This religion is supposedly practiced by all the members of the heavy metal group [Tool], but since it is nearly impossible to find any writings about Lachrymology that aren't related to Tool, it is obvious that Lachrymology was a hoax made up by Tool. ; Since several of Tool's songs attack the cult [Scientology], it is likely that Lachrymology was made up as a satire of Scientology, especially since Tool has claimed that Scientology has drawn many followers away from Lachrymology.
