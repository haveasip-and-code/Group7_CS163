Karl Marx
Important 19th century economist and philosopher who, like many other academics of his time, believed that [God] was a character in a fictional novel. Is remembered best for writing [The Communist Manifesto] along with [Freidrich Engels], though [Das Kapital](The Capital) gives more thorough coverage of his economic theories and philosophies. He is often ridiculed unjustly by right-leaning economists, but any economist worth his beans is familiar with the work of Karl Marx. The philosopher [Jean-Paul Satre] used some of Marx's work in creating the philosophy of [Existentialism]. The word [Marxist], derived from his name, is a mild euphimism often used to replace the term [dirty athiestic blood-sucking communist scumbag].
