chocolate-neko
An op of CaffeineLounge, she has worked the chat since the room began. Often less abusive than most other operators, but actively enjoys the sport of kicking. Her name translates to 'chocolate-cat', which earned her the nickname food-cat (administered by j2n4me and TheArcticBanana). ; She has been mimicked in a #CaffeineLounge film starring TheBadassDevil. And she lives in Canada, in case you were curious. ; A little unknown fact is that she is insane, though if confronted with this question she will vehemently deny it.
