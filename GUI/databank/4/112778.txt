Monk
An incredibly good show starring Tony Shaloub. Sharona used to be Monk's assistant but she left and now his assistant is Natalie :-( But its still the funniest show on. Monk is afraid of milk, dogs, germs, small spaces, elevators, kids and birth. He is OCD and needs everything to be perfect. His wife, Trudy died in a car bomb accident and he will never be the same. Hes funny though, and so is everyone else on the show.
