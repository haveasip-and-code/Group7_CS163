No Goal
a popular phrase in Buffalo after the Sabres lost to the Dallas Stars in game 6 of the Stanley Cup series in 1999. The goal involved Brett Hull's skate in the crease when he scored the series winning goal. Mass protests struck around Buffalo, but the result was upheld. To this this day, the words 'No Goal' will always refer to Buffalo.
