Frisco Carousel
In a dark room with no windows and one door and a dirt floor, a group of at least 8 men circle around one naked man in the center. All of them are smoking cigarettes and trying to burn the naked man as he dances to avoid the burns. There is complete silence aside from the crackling of cigarettes and the pattering of the dancer's feet. This goes until the naked guy gets burnt by each person, and whoever burns him last is the next dancer.
