Drizzt Do'urden
Perhaps the most famous Forgotten Realms character, created by Author R. A. Salvatore, Drizzt is a [Drow] or [Dark Elf]. He resides in the world of Toril, the setting of Forgotten Realms books (A spin off of the popular RPG [Dungeons and Dragons]) While Salvatore has recieved much criticism from core [D&D] fans for taking too many liberties on the 'rules' of this fantasy world, it should be noted that his books sell much better than any other authors in the series, and that Drizzt is on of the few D&D characters known widely outside the fantasy gaming world. He is the exception to his evil race, and left his underground homeland to come to the surface, where he learned the ways of a ranger, and learned to worship the god Mielikki. His companions include a magical cat named Guenwhyvar, a Dwarf named Bruenor Battlehamer, a Human named Cattie-brie, a Halfling named Regis, and a Barbarian named Wulfgar. His weapons of choice are two scimitars, though he is quite adept at the bow as well.
