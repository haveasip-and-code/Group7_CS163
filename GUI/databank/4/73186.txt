Real Madrid
A Football team which was formed in 1902, competing in the Primera Division or 'La Liga'. It has never been relegated from top flight football in their 103 years of playing. It is possibly the greatest football club in the history of the game, or for that matter the most successful club of the 20th Century. The King of Spain 'King Alfonso XIII' gave the club the blessing to become 'Real' Madrid C.F. Real meaning Royal in Spainish. They have won a combined total of 29 La Liga titles, 9 Champions League Titles, 1 European Super Cup, 3 Intercontinental Cups, 2 UEFA Cups, 17 Copa del Rey Titles and 7 Spainish Super Cups. Since Florentino Perez took over the role as Club President in 2000 he has spended big on buying great players like Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Micheal Owen, David Beckham and just recently buying Robinho from Santos for the next five seasons. In the past two years unfortunately they haven't won any major titles, but with new reinforcements they look better then ever and will prove their worth in the up-coming season.
