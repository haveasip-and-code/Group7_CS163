Brooklyn is the ugliest, dirtiest slum in America. Half of the freakin place is like 99.9% black (East NY, Brownsville, Bed-Stuy) and some of the most dangerous places in America. The other half consists of run-down white and often Russian ghettos. Between all the Russian immigrants and the Bensonhurst Italians, you won't find 2 people who speak good English unless you go to Manhattan (The REAL City).
