Git It Done
The proper term that everyone else uses instead of the pro-Southern rednecks and the imbred types that say [Git R Dun]. (Other spellings include [Get R Dun], [Git-r-dun], and [Git Er Done].) ; This is the standard phrase that is used for completing a task, to have sex with a girl, make a smart purchase, etc. In addition it is what the majority of all people in [America] say instead of that mangled distortion known as Git R Dun.
