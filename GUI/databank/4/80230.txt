A real Canadian, unlike those asswipes from Ontario and Alberta. The original and best part of Canada, where people are down to earth, take the time to talk with you and ask how you are doing, and are known for being friendly. ; Oh, and we actually respect America, our neighbours and trade partners. Hell, we should join New England, as the rest of Canada has no respect for what we have to offer.
