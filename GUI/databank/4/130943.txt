Cell phone
A portable phone designed for communicating wirelessly through the use of towers called 'cells' hence the name 'cell phone'. Originally very expensive to buy and call on and fairly bulky, are now in some cases free and very small. As they've gotten smaller, more features have been incorperated like silent mode (vibrate or no ring) and other features like MP3 capability, ring tone, camera, color screen and some more features found in more advanced cell phones called 'smartphones' with PDA like functions. Can also be used as 'pleasure device' for women too cheap to purchase a vibrator...
