attack navel
n. ; A term describing someone who is cool overall, but occasionally can be incredibly frustrating. Usually the frustration is caused by the person beating someone else at a game (Scrabble, for example) or something else competitive. Originated on the GameFAQs.com message boards years ago, and while it has maintained a presence since then, it has gone largely unnoticed.
