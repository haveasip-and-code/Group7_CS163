BHA
Butt-Huggers Association. ; A group started in 1994 by some young guns in Mountain View to express their homosexuality. Founding members included, Bobby BHA, Buttjam BHA, Brownie BHA, Ballista BHA and some other schmucks I can't remember. Their hand shake was a 20 part shake with various lame innuendos including sucking on a loly pop. The group split up in 1998 when they found out Milli Vanilli faked their performance casuig dismay among the BHA-ers.
