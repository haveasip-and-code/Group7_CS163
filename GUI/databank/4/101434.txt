Fancy Pants
Nickname for a co-worker that dresses up every Hall-o-ween with a prosthetic, rubber ass no matter what the costume. Ironically, every time the ass is placed on the body, the co-worker ends up in some sort of physical altercation. This is thought to originate from Salt Lake City, Utah (Home of the village idiots and mormoms).
