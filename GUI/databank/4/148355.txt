bong-aid
A unique beverage consisting of used [bong water], several packets of [kool-aid], and a large amount of sugar. Bong-aid is consumed in the belief that [bong water] contains at least a small amount of [THC], which is quite controversial. ; It should ideally appear to be more of a thin syrup than a beverage, because a large amount of sugar is neccessary to neutralize the inherently foul taste of [bong water].
