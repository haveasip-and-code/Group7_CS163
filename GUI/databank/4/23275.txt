Game Crazy
A store devoted to selling video games, consoles, and accessories. Usually found next to a Hollywood Video, Game Crazy sells XBox, Playstation 2, Gamecube, Gameboy Advance, and Nintendo DS games, and will even do trade-ins. It also sometimes offers promotions or competitions. ; Similar to GameStop, it may be managed by asshole employees who don't know anything about games, and may have a female employee in there for no apparent reason. But, of course, that depends on which Game Crazy you shop in, as some manage their stores better than others.
