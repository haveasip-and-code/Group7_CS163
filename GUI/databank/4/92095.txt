Poser
A poser is a person that has no goal to accomplish, other than to irritate those around them in desperate pleas and cries for help. ; A person can't be a poser if there is nothing to pose as. ; A person that is imitating the acts of their idols or someone else that has accomplished the act in their own time (the past). ; A person that claims they are something that they know nothing about is not a poser, they are just ignorant. In fact, maybe you should educate them in your spare time instead of reading this deifinition. ; A person that is very young and unwilling to be taught the correct ways of their stereotype (hehehe... I love that definition). ; ect.
