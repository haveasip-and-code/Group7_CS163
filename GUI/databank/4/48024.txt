feminine
Of a woman. Traditionally, in most cultures, the expectation for a lady to be nurturing, demure, to care for her family, to look beautiful, and to be submissive to her husband(or girlfriend). ; But not all women are like that. More than enough women are strong, direct, and independent. What is feminine is what a woman does.
