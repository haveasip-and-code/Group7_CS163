Democrites
Another derogatory nickname for a [Democrat], especially a [liberal]. It is a contraction of Democrat (first half) and hypocrites (second half). This is used based on the fact that most Democrats are a bunch of two-faced hypocrites who only defend certain positions and stand up for certain groups of people.
