H3
Short for HUMMER 3. An SUV-sized vehicle designed by the good folks at General Motors which retails for between $29,500-$32,730. The newest addition to GM's HUMMER lineup, the H3 attempts to cash-in on the feeling of virility and conspicuous consumerism one gets from owning either of the two previous HUMMER models. ; Genesis: ; An extremely large vehicle initially designed for military use, the classic HUMMER, or H1, has traditionally carried with it an air of financial indulgence coupled with a strange sense of utilitarian sophistication that has made the ownership of an H1 quite enviable and popular. ; Evolution: ; The successively unveiled H2 proved slightly less popular. Basically an updated version of the H1, the H2 managed to retain the original model's girth while exhibiting rounder curves and a sleeker yet ultimately more feminine body. ; Future?: ; In stark contrast, the most recently released H3 fails to retain the HUMMER's iconic size, style and functionality, opting instead to focus on issues of gasoline efficiency and environmental-friendliness. Carrying a much-diminished visceral impact and priced well below the $40,000 mark, the H3 seeks to radically re-define the concept of HUMMER ownership. Designed to drive rather than thrill and priced to own rather than impress, this new breed of Jeep-SUV amalgamate may either hold the key to the HUMMER's future success in the automotive market or in fact prove elemental in the dissolution of the HUMMER brand.
