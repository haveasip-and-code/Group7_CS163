Off-white Metal
This is a bullshit genre of metal that comes from [black metal] that is exactly the same color, just a little off-white, and therefore is not black. This sounds exactly like [death metal], but is still black metal that is a little off-white. Off-white metal did not originate anywhere. This can be most closely related to the collection of these types of metals; black, death, thrash, gore, gore-death, death-black, black-thrash, death-thrash, death-gore, black-gore, power heavy, lollipop thrash, and pop metal. This does not include Linkin Park though. They are the farthest thing from metal ever created.
