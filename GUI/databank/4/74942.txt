Jankles
Jankles is a clown with green hair that wanders into people's homes through their back doors in search of a toilet to flush his hair in, or to give himself a swirley if you will. Urban legend has it that in the late 1960s a man named Carl Larl got killed in a savage green paint factory explosion and has ever since been trying to wash the paint out of his hair by using the toilets of people's houses in northeastern Ohio.
