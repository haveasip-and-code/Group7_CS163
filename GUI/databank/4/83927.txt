boonaca
originally created by the mongolian winston hu, this word, like some words, has two definitions. unlike some words, these two definitions, are quite conflicting, and can cause quite merry annoyance and confusion when uttered. ; 1. a god-like, stunningly, heart-wrenchingly, eye-numbingly, makes-you-stop-driving-while-on-freeway ; beauty of a girl that then makes salmann talk about nothing else for literally the next 20 hours. this word is used ; ONLY for the rarest of females;a girl can be amazingly hot and not boonaca, but if she is boonaca, doosh. ; 2. a wretched, heart-arresting, domarejectepwnage on your eyes, girl, who inflicts cruel and unusual punishment upon the commonwealth of society by letting herself be seen by the public eye, which then turns blind. the term boonaca is best used when someone, for example salmann, views a girl and believes her to be boonaca, but upon further inspection, sees that she is in reality NOT boonaca. then that girl by default becomes boonaca.
