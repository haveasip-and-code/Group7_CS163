rage in a cage
the activity in which two or more people are locked in a cage and forced to throw semen on each other from cups (monkeys may sometimes be involved). There may, or may not be a bucket to refill the cups with semen. Not all 'rage in cage' is punishment. In some cultures (come to think of it most cultures) find it an hounorable experience. ; Although it may be an erotic and fun experience there are some hazards invloved, Such as STD infections and possibly a case of [sputum], which is not as nice as it sounds. However it is still a top notch sport, some even call it the sport of kings..... a few more years and it will be in the olymipc games. Watch out beijing 2008 games coz here comes rage in a cage!
