Canis Lupus Noctem ; (I hope I did that right) ; A rare Ohioan canid. This canid, like the Xirex, is nocturnal and can be found in the natural enviroment of the basement. This wolf's nocternal nature has given it excellent night time vision. This canid specializes in many technical areas, and thus is a 'Jack of All trades'. This canid is also extremely dangerous in the enviroment known as 'Unreal Tournament'. This canid can be found using his technology to communicate with the Xirex and Jadewolf over long distances.
