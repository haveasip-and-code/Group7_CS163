Big Ben
A nickname commonly [and undeservingly] given to Ben Wallace, #3 on the Detroit Pistons NBA team. ; He most likely got this nickname not only because of his size, but also because of his massive, nasty attitude problem. ; This attitude problem got Ron Artest into a lot of trouble, and causes fans from other teams all over the country to hate the shit out of him =]
