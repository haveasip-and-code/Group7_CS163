EDTV
Stands for 'Enhanced Definition Television'. Has a resolution of 480p (852x480 pixels progressive). Most DVD players today are able to output a progressive signal, meaning that DVDs can be displayed in 480p. Much better than standard definition TV, but still not as good as [HDTV]. Think hard before purchasing an EDTV viewing medium, as HD-DVDs and the increasing number of HD channels will make you regret the decision not to get a proper HDTV.
