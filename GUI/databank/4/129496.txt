zut
although 'zut' traditionally means 'damn it!' in french, it is also a word that one uses to replace a swear word of any sort in a french fashion, without being glared at for improper or inappropriate use of language. ; note to readers: i strongly recomment 'zut' to replace all existing swear words due to its remarkable flexability of stretching to other forms.
