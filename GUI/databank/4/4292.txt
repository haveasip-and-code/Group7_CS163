water polo
Water polo is a sport played on by the quickest, stongest, smartest and best conditioned athletes. A water polo team consists of 7 mentally instable people (who in gods name would want to be putting breathing air second to the untimate goal of victory). The players in the pool consist of 6 field players and a goalie, each player relies on each one of his team mates. The object of the game would not only be to stay above the water while everyone is try to put you under, but to shoot the ball past the goalie and score. There are rules... when your on the surface of the water(which isn't often).Under the surface anything goes. Trying to shoot a ball with everyone and thier mother beating on you could prove to be a challenge. 'Survival of the fitest' And just for the record, We are NOT swimmers.
