zangetsu
Badass sword owned by the one and only Kurosaki Ichigo from Bleach. In its shikai form the sword looks kind of like a giant butcher knife. In its bankai form it's a long, black katana. And its persona is that of a scruffy-looking man in black who is TOO BADASS TO ACCURATELY PUT INTO WORDS.
