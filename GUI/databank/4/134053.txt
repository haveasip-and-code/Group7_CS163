michigan state university
A university in East Lansing, Michigan. Mostly for the bitter students who did not get into [U of M]. 90% of the students are arrogant assholes from small towns in Michigan. They all dress the same too with that stupid as hell [fugly] North Face jackets. Most of the guys are unattractive, pretentious wannabe jocks or frat brothers. A lot of the girls are raging whores with bad fashion senses leading them into Wet Seal. There are the minorities who are [chill] or plain annoying and loud. There are wannabe [scensters] and farmers. This place is stupid- avoid it like the plague. I went there so i know what I am talking about. ; Maybe there is something in the water, considering it taste like [shit]. ; On the plus side there some [reefer] madness.
