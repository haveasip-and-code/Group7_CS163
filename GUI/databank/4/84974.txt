lesbian
a female who feels she has strong feelings for other women sexually or romantically. There is no set 'look' for a lesbian because they come in all shape and forms. Lesbians are of any 'posse' any religions, any denomination because (yes) they are normal people. Just because a girl is dating another girl doesnt mean she is lesbian. She could be bisexual or even bi-curious so dont assume things because that makes us really mad. I suggest you not call a lesbian a 'dyke' because we dont like that very much either. And (no) not all of us are whores who wish to please other men. We just go with what our hearts say.
