2-PaC
All these definitions about 2pac are true he was THE best rapper of all times no doubt about it ....... But there is 1 thing that all of them may have wrong ... there are some of us still today that believe pac is still alive ... they say he got shot .. to death but ... pac wore a bullet proof vest all the time why would he have took it off just for that 1 incident? and another thing .. after a shooting// killing its illegal to not have an otopsy ... they never did 1 on pac .. so wth is up with that? and 1 more thing before his last abulm came out after he died ...on the 13th ... there was 1 song with pac singing about b.i.g dien .. b.i.g died after pac so how would he know .... that b.i.g was gonna die? or is dead..??
