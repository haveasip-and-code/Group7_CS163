Ninja Tight Deathgrip
Ninja tight deathgrip's, or NTD's, occur when some gangsta azz wigga azz [mofo] ninja puts his hand near a fatal area and squeezes, preventing any possible escape. Possible areas of attack include the neck, general chest area (GCA), or [chimpo]/[cooter]/[front butt]. Typically, ninja's do not attempt this attack on themselves. The only known ways to escape are: 1) Having a nearby ally immediately kill the ninja or 2) simply allowing the ninja to kill you.
