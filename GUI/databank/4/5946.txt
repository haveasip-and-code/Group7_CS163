fangirl
May be either a small organized group or a large unorganized group of young fanatical females. They suffer an absurd affinity for a randomly chosen object of obsession and base their life/daily schedual around it. Not necessarily a male object of interest, although this is most common. Can possibly be a clothing line, makeup brand, latest skater look, and stupid-looking,annoying flip-flop sandals made out of cheap mesh and spraypaint. ; Many young females are obsessed with Juicy, Ambercrombie & Fitch, and Hollister. This is the only line of clothing they will wear. If they are forced to wear something from Dillard's or Taget they are overcome with a squealy, whiney voice and bitch about how *fat* and *ugly* they look. ; IMMEDIATE REMEDY: tell them to be quiet and go throw up again.
