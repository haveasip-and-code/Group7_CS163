elkton
a town (if you can call it that) in maryland where the idea of expanding consists of a new trailor home development. usually a manure scent can be detected while driving down the 40 mile one lane road that is travelled daily by the residents. the highlight of the town is a mega walmart where a various assortment of mullets (both male+female) can be found
