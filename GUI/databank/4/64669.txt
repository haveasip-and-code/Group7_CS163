Riki
aka Riki Maraton ; This is a rare find! Being very difficult to spot in a crowd due to a ; noticable lack of height and stumpy appearance, this animal is clearly distinguishable by ; its slanted, slit-like eyes and a yellowish tinge to throughout its ; mangey coat. ; This vervin's antics are only identified upon forced entry to a ; commonly known female-orofice, which is adopted in an exceptionally ; casual manner. This is regularly known as 'issuing a bit of the riki-maraton'. ; The getaway is this creatures remarkable talent, it is often found sliding ; uphill draggin its prey, like a '6-pack zamalegs', to a more suitable mating location. A smirk is also ; visible on this brutes face upon leaving the scene. ; Both mothers and daughters beware. The creature can be deterred by uttering the words...'I want to be your ; girlfriend' into the animals ear....if you can bend that far down. Be forewarned, whilst down there the sneaky ; bugger will attempt to coax you into oral stimulation even after it has decided to cut it's losses and flee. ; It seems to inject some venemous mind-altering substance which actually encourage ; further interatcion with the creature, as for some reason, the prey keeps returning ; to endure more torture. Once it has toyed enough and sucked the life out of its victim, ; the riki will move on to another unsuspecting female. ; Be warned....this pussy-cat looks nice to stroke, but upon engagement it heads straight for the crotch. ; Once it has struk, the victim keels over and the riki has his way from behind. Definite homosexuality problems here. ; If this creature tried to befriend you...DISOWN IT. ; Regularly seen with the milli-hyena. They tend to forge a relationship upon hunting. When unsucessful for too long ; they have been known to turn on each other. Not a pretty sight.
