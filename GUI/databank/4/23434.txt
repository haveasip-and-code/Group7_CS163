DeviantART
A website where various artists can submit their work. However, within less then a minute after submission, the art quickly is archived to make room for new submissions. Because of this, it is not uncommon for some work to go entirely unseen. The only way to get noticed is to either draw fan-art, anime, or take a black and white picture of your slit wrists and call it 'emotional.'
