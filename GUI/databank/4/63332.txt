you think.com
The most ridiculously hipocritical and fascist website ever. Youthink.com primes itself on allowing its users freedom of speech and expression, unfortunatly all of its memebers are [tools] and anyone who says anything even slightly rebbellious or out of the ordinary is instantly [flamed]. ; Some paticulary sad users include, 'Raddicks', the appropriatly named 'Bastard' and by far the most spanner like of the tools 'Ad astra'.
