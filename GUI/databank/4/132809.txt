The Urban School
The Urban School is a small, fiercely independent high school in San Francisco, founded in the late 60's and located in the Haight Ashbury neigborhood of San Francisco. Its students are notoriously intelligent, friendly, street wise, and respected. Intense discussion based classes prompt the earnest students to think deeply and act wisely. The Urban School has all of the earthy San Francisco character that its rival, University High School, lacks.
