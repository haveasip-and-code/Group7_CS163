Star Syndicate
Like the Clock Crew and the Lock Legion, the Star Syndicate are a flash group from newgrounds. However, they are quite short. The number of members are only about 10-20+. And good movies are scarce. Sometimes, they like to help Coolboyman a.k.a. StrawberryClock with his 'collections'. Collections are short movies mocking the thing (e.g. Ed Edd n Eddy, Speed Racer, American Idol, etc.) involving the collection. These members are usually Fourstar and Sevenstar. They are also the creators of Dailytoons. After the 100th edition of Dailytoons they stopped making them, only ending up creating Daily2oons. Like the Clock Crew and the Lock Legion, they have their own day - Star Day, which I don't know when it is.
