Persia
Greek name of the empire of ruled by the Indo-European peoples of the Iranian plateau during the Achaemenid dynasty. The name got carried over by Europeans for more than two millennia. In actuality the inhabitants of 'Persia' for millennia have called it Iran, meaning 'land of the Aryans'. 'Persians', Iranians, were responsible for some of the greatest contributions to the modern world. Some examples are the concepts of universal human rights under Cyrus, or Kourosh, the Great, the development of the first postal system, intercontinental road system known as the 'Royal Road', modern algebra, medical procedures and analysis of disease, and overall the first empire to form a multicultural basis and the concepts of 'states' which have formed the basis of organization that nearly all modern countries follow to this day.
