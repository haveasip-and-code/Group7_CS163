Southern Lehigh High School
Southern Lehigh is a rural school in a rather wealthy area of majority homogeneous (white) student population; nevertheless the influx of African-Americans and Puerto-Ricans has severely damaged its reputation of late. Often times considered an athletic cesspool by outsiders, one has to look no further than the swim team to find the heart and soul of the athletic, academic and social community*. Southern Lehigh graduates and students alike pride themselves on their ability to consume mass quantities of alcohol with apparent ease*. ; *All references to things 'good' are 98% a reflection of the graduated society
