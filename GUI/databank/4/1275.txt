boovin
Someone who takes the most menial job seriously, working for years and years at a low-wage unskilled job and being happy about it. This person usually ingratiates themselves to the management by letting themselves be taken advantage of, squealing on their coworkers for petty shit, adn generally being a tool. Derived from the fast-food industry's original Boovin, a legendary figure shrouded in mystery.
