John Dolmayan is the drummer for the band [System of a Down]. As a drummer, he is noted for his high-hat to snare combo. He has recorded 4 albums with the group, with HYPNOTIZE, the band's other half of their double album, MEZMERIZE/HYPNOTIZE, to follow late September, 2005. In my own opinion, when I listen to his drumming, I feel like I'm hearing 2 drummers instead of only one. As other critics have said, he has a 'schizophrenic' style of drumming. [Serj Tankian], lead singer for System of a Down, has been noted for saying that he is always trying to make John crack a smile on stage. He tries to keep a straight face and not get put off beat. By keeping a straight face and wearing a black suit, he is said to resemble a member of the Russian Mafia. All in all, all drummers should aspire to one day have the skill of this man.
