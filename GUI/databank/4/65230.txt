apadravya
A piercing that goes straight through the glans of the penis. Usually done with a straight barbell. The position of the barbell parallel to the floor when the penis is hanging down. Supposedly the most sensuous piecing (sexually speaking) because of the ability to massage the G or P spot upon insertion of a man or woman.
