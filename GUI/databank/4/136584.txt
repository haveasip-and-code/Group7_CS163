noids
Noids are those weird looking things used in an advertising ploy for Dominos pizza. Where Dominos released a video game called 'Avoid the noid' ; Do a google search on 'avoid the noid'... ; The game had hilarious graphics, and i believe it was on 5''x4'' floppy disks! THat noid wants some Zza, and he wants it right fucking now!
