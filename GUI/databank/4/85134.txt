Poppers
People placed in a musical subculture somewhere between Punk, Rock 'n Roll, Mod, Emo, Pop, Pop punk, Powerpop, and sometimes Rap. Often dressed in a mockery of the 'Preppy' fashion, with a collared shirt (either polo or button down), sometimes a tie, semi tight jeans (either stretch, flared or tapered), short/shaggy hair (sometimes dyed), converse gym shoes, sometimes a fedora or some sort of a hat. Originated in Chicago, it is a growing subculture.
