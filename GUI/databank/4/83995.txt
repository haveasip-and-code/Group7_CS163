Peter Griffin
The absolute best animated character ever. He stars in the absolute best animated show ever, Family Guy. I am obsessed with that show. If anyone disses Family Guy in my presence, I become very, very angry, and generally do things that I later regret. ; Peter Griffin lives with his wife, Lois, and his three kids, Chris, Meg and Stewie, in Quahog, Rhode Island (and sometimes Petoria). He works at Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory. ; I salute him.
