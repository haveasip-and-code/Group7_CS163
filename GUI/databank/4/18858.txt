walrus
On november 9th, 1969, Paul McCartney of The Beatles supposedly died in a car crash, resulting in a long train of supposed clues in songs and on album covers after that. Examples of such clues would be what the Beatles are wearing on the cover of Abbey Road, Paul wearing a Walrus suit on the cover of Magical Mystery Tour, and the song I Am the Walrus. The term Walrus at the time meant someone who was dead, so this implied that Paul was indeed dead. Then on the White Album on the song [Glass Onion] (a coffin with a glass top) John Lennon sings 'Well here's another clue for you all: The Walrus was Paul', meaning that Paul was supposedly dead. Of course, he's still alive and well. This was all just a hoax.
