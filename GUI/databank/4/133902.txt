Suburban Princess
The modern version of the idealized 1950's house wife (see: June Cleaver). She's a stay-at-home-mom that needs day care, and a maid to free her up for lunch dates with other Suburban Princesses, and afternoons pool side. She needs a high wage earning spouse to cover her cost since she is an expense rather than a contributor to the household. Unlike her 1950's predecessor she has no useful household skills; i.e. laundry, cooking, sewing. Typically the only thing she can make for dinner are reservations. If she encounters a single working mother and mentions how hard her life is she is most likely to be jerked bald and then beaten to death by said single working mother.
