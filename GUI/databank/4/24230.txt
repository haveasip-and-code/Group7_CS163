crapflood
Crapflooding is a form of trolling online media such as discussion websites or Usenet newsgroups with nonsensical, inane, and/or repetitive postings in order to make it difficult for other users to read other postings. It can also be motivated by a desire to waste the targetted site's bandwidth and storage space with useless text. ; It is also used to refer to such postings on image boards which queue a certain number of pictures at any given time, and thus crapflooding pushes back (or even out) relevant information. ; As a technique, crapflooding is typically considered by other trolls to be a 'lesser' form of trolling since less intellectual effort is involved in carrying it out. However, initiating crapflooding may involve significant intelligence and work; for instance, in having to circumvent anti-crapflooding measures. ; Crapflooding can also be carried out via scripts or other utilities, which could handle the task much quicker than doing so by hand.
