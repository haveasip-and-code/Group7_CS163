Kanna
The first incarnation of [Naraku], she appears to be a little girl with white cloths, hair and glazed over eyes. She is a demonic empty vessel,so she has no soul or emotions. This makes her seem really scary, about the scariest villian in the show [Inuyasha]. She attacks with a mirror that can also absorb the souls of her others, a favorite pastime of hers. Unlike her younger sister [Kagura], She is very loyal to her father/master [Naraku].
