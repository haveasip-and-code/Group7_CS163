indonesia
A beautiful land with many natural resources. Rich in flora and fauna , a definite paradise for tourists. ; For residents, its a fucked up placed to live where the Military controls everything. Aceh aids are being siphoned by the fucked up military. Chinese live in fear over there and they can't even speak their native language without fear of getting killed. ; Therefore , a beautiful paradise filled with fucked up people.
