Jack Bauer
1.) Jack Bauer, a Field Agent on TV program 24. Aleneng, a superhero and an all round cool dude. Kinda like action man but with better hair. Works for CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit), Los Angeles. ; 2.) To pull a Jack Bauer is to perform a heroic act, such as save the world from evil Middle Eastern terrorists (who always seem to be working with the British. Well that's a compliment.).
