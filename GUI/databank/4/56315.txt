catholic church
religion that is supposdely ruled by love. In earlier times the catholic church did and still tries to instill fear into followerrs by basing their religion with fear of wrong doing punishable by going to hell once person is dead. (Hell is actually a Norse belief that catholics adopted from Norse religious beliefs of the after life. Merely changed to two l's on spelling and having a big dude in red pyjamas called satan to rule it instead of a half rotting non-mortal bitter woman called hel.) ; Through the use of fear and piety of positions and dogmatic view of their religion, cathlics priests believe their religion to be the true church. (Yeah like i haven't heard that from about 50 other religions.) ; Priests in modern times have been uncovered as child molesters and other despicable acts. The self righteousnees held by some catholics is digusting and all consuming, either way firm catholic or the ones that go on easter and christmas only, everything they say needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
