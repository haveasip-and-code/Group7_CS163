darwin fish
A metal fish decal that parodies the christian [jesus fish] that lots of people put on the back of their cars. It says 'DARWIN' inside the body of the fish and has feet, symbolizing the evolution of the species. Sometimes these fish have other things inside them, like the word 'Evolve'.
