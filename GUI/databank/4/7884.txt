Camembert Quartet
A disgustingly hilarious Irish comedy band. ; Members: ; Clint velour - Guitar, vocals ; Bunny Green - Drums, vocals ; Vic Ferrari - Bass, vocals ; James wand (AKA major james) - keyboards, vocals ; Dr. Sleeze - Saxaphone, vocals ; No matter what genre of music you like they'll be able to slag it. They have 2 LPs now which can be purchased world wide. 'music is war' and 'the camembert quartet sell out'. Both concept albums. ; If you're not irish you may be confused by some of the comedy in the talking tracks. The funny thing is when they're making fun of genres by making up songs in that genre's style, they may be making fun of it but the songs actually sound good.
