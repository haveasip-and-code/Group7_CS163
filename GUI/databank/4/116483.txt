Alternate Futures
Alternate Futures is this ability to go and try to do different things without any of the consequences. You can just revert to a save point in your mind. ; Like, you have this set button on you, and when you hit it, anything you do can be reset to that time when you hit the set button ; That way you could do whatever you want. Hit the set button, go punch your father and then hit reset. No consequences. It's insane. ; Wow
