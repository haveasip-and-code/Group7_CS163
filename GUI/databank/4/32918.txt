hardcore
Hardcore used to refer to a more intense version of punk, but has since branched off into a new genre. Vocals are usually screechy, lyrics usually histrionic (exaggerated and often inappropriate displays of emotional reactions, approaching theatricality) and whiny, music often switches between very quiet and very loud in a single song. Many hardcore kids are also self righteous and humourless about being straight edge, to the point of condemning those who choose a different lifestyle. They wear black primarily, and sometimes a scarf/bandanna in the back pocket. They are often pierced or tattoed as an alternative to ingesting intoxicants. ; Hardcore bands: My Chemical Romance, Alexisonfire, Girls Against Boys, Q And Not U, The Used, Refused, Thursday, Thrice
