fardo
person you has the curious and arguably anti-social habit of falling asleep in the middle of the floor in casual meetings and/or parties. The ingestion of alcohol is not always an explanation to that sudden hybernation. The people around, if they don't try to do some frat-boy prank like pissing on the corpse, usually cover him or her with a blanket to prevent a flu. This benevolent action gives the dude or chick the look of a wrapped mummy ('fardo' in spanish).
