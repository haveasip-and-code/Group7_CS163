Alternative Rock
Music usually influenced by punk, grudge, goth, indie, as well as classic rock. Sometimes called Modern Rock. It's not designed specifically to be popular, usually doesn't include any synthesizers or mixed music, and is usually less 'harsh' than what one would classify as Hard Rock. ; The label 'Alternative' often applies to new music/bands before they become more widely popular due to creative people whose music does not fit into current genres.
