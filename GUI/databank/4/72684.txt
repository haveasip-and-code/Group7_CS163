PE
An utterly useless subject intended by communist dictators like our government to improve the quality of life by exposing young children and adolescents to an hour a day of athletic torture. Games such as Dodgeball and Kickball are most common, though sometimes the occasional (pointless) game of Indian Soccer or Ultimate Frisbee can be seen. Most PE teachers are commonly seen wearing T-shirts and nylon shorts with Nikes and usually have hair cut short. When asked about sexual preference, they usually repond by assigning as many push-ups as is legal.
