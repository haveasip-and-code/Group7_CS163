4chan
The best image board in existence. Whether you're there to chat on World4ch, talk about video games, get your daily anime kick, post images of nature and wildlife, show off your art, discuss technology, or bust a nut to some [hentai], 4chan is teh r0x. I'm there everyday. You can become popular on 4chan through posting witty comments and uploading images. You can also use a 'tripcode' (# followed by a code or code word), to lower the chance of imposters. The highest quality hentai is posted to 4chan everyday. There are many categories in 4chan, for example /n/ (Nature and Wildlife), /h/ (Hentai), /d/ (Alternative Hentai; for example hentai with [tentacle rape] or [dickgirls] in it), /b/ (Random, where you can act like a total idiot and get away with it...extremely fun!), and /c/ (Anime/Cute. Post your [kawaii] stuff here) There are many more sections, go to 4chan to see for yourself. www.4chan.org
