WTO
a group of fucking money and power hungry ass holes who will do any thing they fucking can to get more power and money human life is nothing to them! ; The World Trade Organization is the most powerful legislative and judicial body in the world. By promoting the 'free trade' agenda of multinational corporations above the interests of local communities, working families, and the environment, the WTO has systematically undermined democracy around the world. ; Unlike United Nations treaties, the International Labor Organization conventions, or multilateral environmental agreements, WTO rules can be enforced through sanctions. This gives the WTO more power than any other international body. The WTO's authority even eclipses national governments.
