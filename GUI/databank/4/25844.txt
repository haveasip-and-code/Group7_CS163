1. basically crap ; 2. basically crappy music listened to by liberal jerkholes all about 'ooooooh my life is so depressing....its all about me .....im such a cockyassed bitch who only cares about myself......cry' They pride themselves in saying that they brought an end to hair metal but hey they didnt. Hair Metal's downfall was for the most part internal. They kinda killed themselves see my definition for [hair metal]
