nice t's
a beautiful set of sweater kittens. you say it to girls but you don't want them to get all high and mighty so they don't blow you later so after saying 'nice t's' you say 'not you'. sure it's cruel and gets there hopes up, but in the long run, it helps you in your quest to nail them in the seat.
