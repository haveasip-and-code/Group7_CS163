Dottie
Master of outwitting the squirrels, by wrapping on a window so that they fall from her birdfeeder into the pond below, Dottie is a being unmatched. She sits at the dining room table all day long with her saggy tits, smoking her cigarettes one by one, even though they told her she is sure to die, because she nearly did several years ago, and then again started smoking. She also tends to watch her 13-inch black and white television set even though she has a 32 inch color one in the living room, not to mention her son's humungous wang of well over (can't even be calculated right now, as he's currently sitting on it) the two tv's inches combined!
