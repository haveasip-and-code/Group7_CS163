The DS is a portable system with dual screens, one that you can 'touch' with your fingers or a pen, a D-Pad control system, 4 buttons (all SNES style, labeled ABYX in the same fashion), 2 shoulder buttons (Also SNES style, L and R), the stuff letting you play Nintendo DS games, and a GBA emulator (but you can't have all the GBA 'additionals', and you are limited to 1P modes). It has, basically, N64-style graphics, but they are slightly improved. There are also dual speakers, and the design of the DS allows it to be 'flipped' closed. As a side note, the only portable system really competing up to the DS is the [PSP]. ; 2. An abbreviation meaning '[Dick Suck]'. ; 3. An abbreviation meaning '[Dark Side]'. ; 4.
