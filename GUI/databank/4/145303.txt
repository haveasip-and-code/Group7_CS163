Aour
'Aour' is a word used to describe extreme frusteration or annoyance. The word does not need to be with other words in a sentence for 'Aour' is a sentence in itself. The word was first used by Cody and Darryl in the good old days before Dustin ruined it with his bad pronounciation and emphasis that just destroyed the mood.
