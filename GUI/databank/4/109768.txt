Machiko
Female guitarist and vocalist of popular Japanese underground punk rock group Machikara. ; Quite self consciously named her band after herself - 'Machi-kara' means from the city (machi), and she now writes the Japanese character for city for the 'Machi' character in her name. ; The band name could mean 'from Machi(as in Machiko)', so it's one of the vainest band names I've heard. Some Japanese people don't even know this connection. ; She's basically Japan's version of Avril Lavigne. But she writes her own songs :P
