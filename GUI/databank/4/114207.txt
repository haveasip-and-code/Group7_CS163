hanabuddah days
Word used in Hawaii that refers to one's childhood. Derived from the Japanese word 'hana', meaning 'nose', and the English word 'butter', which in spoken in Hawaiian pidgin can sound like 'buddah.' So Hanabata Days are the 'nose butter' days, or the days when we had runny noses. Can also spelled [Hanabata Days].
