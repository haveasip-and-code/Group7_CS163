Shoq ink
The method of a [chatroom]denizen who goes to any lengths for attention (usually from [Blondeislosts]) not limited to promoting genocide, lying to create controversy and making malicious statements unheard of even among dockworkers, all for the purpose of keeping the focus of attention of the [chatroom] on his- or herself. Note: the individual is likely to be unemployed, on public assistance and/or supported by maternal funds and generally very unhappy with life and his- or herself.
