game affair
Contrary to a [love affair], involves no strings like sex, and is reserved for those male-female partners that enjoy a non-intimate, purely fun and outgoing association. Since this type of relationship can be found in simple friendships, the term 'game affair' should be reserved for use in [MMORPG]s that include a version of marriage with no real physical or emotional attachment. ; See [WoW] or [NexusTK] or whatever utilitarian MMORPG people consume themselves with these days.
