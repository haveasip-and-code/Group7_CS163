dance-off
The best way to put shame upon another human being. If someone undermines, contradicts, insults, etc. etc. you challenge them to a dance off, which shows which is then either followed by about a minute or so dance turns between the two, or the pansy-face declines and has to live in a shadow of shame for the rest of their life. A dance off goes for about six rounds, but sometimes it is a draw at the end so it goes on much, much longer, usually it is judged by any person standing by, rarely judged by actual 'Dance-off Judgers'.
