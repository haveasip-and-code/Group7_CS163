Argo 447
Argo Hall, originally the oldest, gayest, lamest, most ramshackle building at UCSD aside from the fleets (or mud huts, as they have been called), six stories tall. Argo 447, located on the fourth floor, houses the largest collection of alcohol in all of La Jolla, aside from the bars and pubs. The occupants of the 2004-5 school year and their friends throw the rockinest parties in any dorm anywhere. Knowing UCSD, next year the said room will be occupied by three boys whose combined heights total twelve feet tall, and can handle a combined total of one serving of hard liquor between the three of them in one evening before turning cherry red, on the days/nights that they are not absorbed in counter-strike.
