Gator Skin Balls
They are the most fearsome dodgeball squadren ever assmbled by mankind. There throws are equal to the power of 17 atomic bombs, and they are able to dodge 100 bullets at the same time. They often leave their opponets bloody and missing several limbs. They have no mercy for woman, children, firemen, or ex-Marines, and if the Gods themselves came down to play dodgeball, the Gator Skin Balls would be victorious.
