taking a yard
A shortened version of the common adage: 'If you give them an inch, they'll take a yard.' Used in circumstances when one has been granted a favor, but attempts to ask for more. Can be used in apologetic, self-deprecation on the part of the asking party, or in disgust by the party being asked. Usually used so that the giving party knows that they are not being taken advantage of, even if they probably are.
