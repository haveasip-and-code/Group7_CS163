testie pop
What happens usually to a teenage boy, could be during pubity...but it is very humours to people around. It is when a young male will say -usual in one syllabol of a word and his voice changes into a high pitch in that part of his sentence, when this happens other onlookers r forced to yell out and embarrass the boy by screaming 'TESTIE POP'. OR as a cover up the boy will say 'TESTIE POP!' to himself, so he isnt as embarrassed by everyone else letting other no what has just happened
