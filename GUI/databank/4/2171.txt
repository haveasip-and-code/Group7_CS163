Millie
Girls that hang around in big group, mainly in very loyalist or republican areas of Belfast and in run-down housing estates. Classic Millie icons include tracksuits, (either in brightly coloured vile velour or a rip-off of adidas or other brand name) huge hoop earrings, 4 piercings in each ear, hair tied back very tightly into either a bun with too many 'scrunchies' to count or in a really high ponytail with 6 bobbles, making it stick up at an angle....Millies add 'like' to the end of every other statement....
