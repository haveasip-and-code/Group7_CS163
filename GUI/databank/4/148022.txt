G string
form of female undergarment/panties whereby the rear fabric is replaced with spaghetti string to reduce visible panty lines, and give the impression under a skirt or dress that the female is not wearing panties at all. Recently worn as bikini bottoms as exterior clothing. So named because tension on the spaghetti strap seems to be in a position to stimulate the female Graffenberg spot, aka G-spot.
