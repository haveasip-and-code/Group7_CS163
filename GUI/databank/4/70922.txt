chezzabella
A rare breed of bird that's normally found drinking fancy beer in dodgy pubs. Her red hair acts as nature's own warning beacon. Approach at your own peril!!! Found in company of the Frank's and [Messica]'s of this world. You've been warned; contact with this creature may result in memory loss of a few days and a frazzled brain. In contrast, if encountered in 'Fluffy' mode the experience might be surprisingly enjoyable. Also know as 'Oi Ginger!', 'B.W.', 'flamed haired temptress' or of late 'R.K.'
