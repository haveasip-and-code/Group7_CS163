British
The people who inhabit the large northwest-European islands known as the British Isles. These are, without a doubt, one of the greatest ethnic groups of people in the entire world. The nation known as the United Kingdom (or [Great Britain]) use to own a great majority of the earth, with colonies in North America, Africa, Far East Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and subcontinent Asia (India). ; In my opinion, the British are a wonderful people, with an awesome culture, beautiful women, the greatest accents, and some of the best bands in the world.
