delta force
1st SFOD-D (Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta) is the U.S.'s most elite counter-terrorist group that supposedly does not exist. They work deep behind enemy lines. They are also used to train armies and special forces groups for nations that cannot make their own. Their first operation was Eagle Claw, the failed attempt to rescue the American hostages from Iran. They worked with the British [SAS] during the Gulf War on 'scud-busting' missions. They are also currently working in Afghanistan and Iraq.
