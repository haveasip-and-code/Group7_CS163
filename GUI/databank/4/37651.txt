american idiot
a.) a slightly below mediocre album by former-punk band green day. yes, they sold out. but what the hell would've happened if the sex pistols had been around for almost two decades? think about it. ; b.) anybody who thinks american idiot is green day's only album, or green day's best album, usually a teenaged girl who makes out with a poster of a certain married man (Billie cough cough) every night. [fucktards]...go ask your daddy for money to buy good green day (i.e.: smooth, kerplunk, dookie, insomniac). or mow a lawn or something. just stfu.
