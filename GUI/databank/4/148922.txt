Zelda: The Wind Waker
In my opinion, the best of the 3D Zelda games (We'll see what 'Twilight Princess' brings us). I believe it tops Ocarina in many aspects. The fighting is more chaotic, there are more moves and your 'helper' (a shiny rock)is less talkative compared to Navi. ; It takes place several hundred years after Ocarina of Time with a new generation of Link. Ganon had broken the seal, Link's sister is captured by Ganon. So Link goes to kick Ganon's ass...again.
