back pack girl
A Japanese girl, usually in the mid 20's to 30's, who packs enough 'essentials' in a small back pack for a one night stand. They often speak very little English, but know at least 'You wanna go on base?' They most often can be found at the American bars on White Pole Road and in the Alley and specifically go to the bars on Friday and Saturday nights and wait for an Airman to pick them up.
