Apartment 3A
Shortened form of apt 3A, or left alone as 3A, is the dwelling of a superior non-human race known as Geisers. The Geisers leech off of the human enviroment. When not in the squallors of their sty, they are often found in urban areas such as laundromats or gyms. The only Geiser life forms to ever be witnessed are The Geisers of Canton. They have sapped to the life of human beings, asking for rides, or for a bit of entertainment.
