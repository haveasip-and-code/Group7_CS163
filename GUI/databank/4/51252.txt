Children of Bodom
Almost all the above definitions stand good.Children of Bodom have the heaviest distortions, the best double bass drums,lowest bass,evil perpetual resonating vocals, all of these combined hold the capability to rip apart any high range speaker system.A lot of their tracks are very uplifting.Tracks like 'everytime i die', 'in the shadows', 'bed of razors', are among others absofuckiglutely worth a high volume listen.The best part about this band is almost all of the tracks have short, fast paced, heavy instrumentals between them.All in All, DADDY's!!
