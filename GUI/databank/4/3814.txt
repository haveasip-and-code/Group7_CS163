chef t's
A chinese restaurant... horrible food, good alchohol. Known for their tequila and 151 shots, adios mother fuckers, and long island ice teas taken on their green faux marble tables. Employees included Wing, Avon, and Mr. Tommy himself. They served to every single teenager in new york city until- tear - they were shut down by the police because of a freshman (who will remain unnamed) who told his mom about it. RIP chef t's!
