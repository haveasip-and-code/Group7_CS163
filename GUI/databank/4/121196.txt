Two wrongs don't make a right
1: It is never right to wrong someone, even if they have wronged you first. ; 2: It is not acceptable to do something bad to someone just because they did something bad to you first. ; 2: Pointing out somebody's wrongdoing to you will not correct a situation by doing wrong to that somebody.
