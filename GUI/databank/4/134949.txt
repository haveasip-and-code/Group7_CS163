rogaining
A particularly [munt]-filled beer drinking event. Competitors compete head to head in an event in which they must skol one beer at each of five stations, and sprint around 50m between stations (often a circuit is set up with the first and last stops at the same station). Notorious for shaking and bloating the stomach while drinking, causing mass amounts of high-velocity chunder into bins which are generally kept at the stations.
