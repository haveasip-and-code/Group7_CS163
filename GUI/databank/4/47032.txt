operation iraqi liberation
Sophomoric acronym made up by drugged up socialist/leftists college kids, similar to Operation Iraqi Freedom, who believe the tripe of the left. For males, it gets them a lot of leftist 'tang. For females, it gives them the appearence of intelligence to rail against the establishment when it only serves to further demonstrate their naivete in world affairs.
