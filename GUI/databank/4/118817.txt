Wholesome
Often brings to mind the blonde, corn-fed farm girl from middle America, but describes a whole slew of different types of women/girls. ; Being 'wholesome' does not make a girl average, ugly, or boring: In fact 'wholesome' pretty much just means a hot girl that isn't jarringly gaudy, obnoxious or slutty.
