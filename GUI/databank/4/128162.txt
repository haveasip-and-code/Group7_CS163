Vivo Mexico
If you've ever woken up and thought to yourself 'i want to chew through a cement block and use a rusty nail to pick my teeth' then you're halfway to understanding the ideal that is vivo mexico. A drink, a dip, an invention by minds far greater than mine. In its most simple, physical form it is a 1/2 shot of jose cuervo (regular of especial) tequila and a 1/2 shot of tostito's chunky salsa. It goes down about as smooth as a handful of glass shards and tastes about as good as a turd wrapped in a kleenex. ; But it is more than the drink. Vivo Mexico is a mentality required by the man whose BAC is never below .08. To kick a night off with a vivo mexico you either have to have more balls than the Iceman Chuck Lidell or have down syndrome; and either way you know you're going to have a good time. If by the end of the night you've hidden behind a bush in flight from a giant ogre, pissed in a water fountain, smoked more hookah than the caterpillar in alice in wonderland, were too numb to notice when you put the blunt out on your hand and couldnt get your dick hard enough to have sex with the fatty on the third floor--send out a special thanks to Vivo Mexico. When being a man just isn't enough. Vivo will make you an ultra-man ; Note - Invented on the campus of UNC - Chapel Hill ; Variations on the vivo mexico shot include ; Vivo Mexico Dirty - 1/2 salsa, 1/2 tequila + whipping cream ; Vivo Mexico Clean - 1/2 salsa, 1/2 tequila + listerine ; Vivo Mexico Round 2 - 1/2 salsa, 1/2 tequila + spitting it all up and then drinking it again
