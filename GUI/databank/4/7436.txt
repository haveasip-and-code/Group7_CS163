vodka flu
The sickness that accompanies heavy consumption of alcohol, usually, but not necessarily vodka, and that as a result causes a person to call out of work for a sick day. ; The word has its origins with office workers looking to avoid being fired for not showing up at the office. Often, office workers have a limited number of vacation days and after a heavy night of binge drinking must take a sick day or risk losing their job. If required to specify a reason for their absence, the common response was to say they had the flu.
