John Galliano
One of the most influential and controversial designers of the 20th century and present, Galliano was born in Gibraltar in 1960 and moved to London in 1966. In 1991 he moved to Paris, and became the designer for Givenchy Ready to wear (RTW) and Haute Couture Collection in 1995, until 1997. He is currently the Chief Designer for Dior, and is best known for how controversial he is. He is one of the most original, and, as some would put it, 'freakish' designers out there. PETA hates him, as he is known to frequently incorporate furs and other animals into his designs.
