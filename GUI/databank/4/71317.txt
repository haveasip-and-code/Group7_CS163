Scemo
A combination of 'scene' and 'emo'. While [scene] kids are just acting emo because it is 'cool', true [emo] kids have issues... or at least they act like they do. Scemo kids have a tendency to act emo when it is convenient, and become outrageously happy and preppy whenever they feel like it. Most scemos are very social. Some people have described these individuals as slightly bipolar.
