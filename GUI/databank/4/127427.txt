Comp Stomp
A game, usually in RTS games, in which real-life players are pitted against more, less or an even amount of computer-controlled players. ; Usually this involves playing the maximum amount of allied human players vs. one enemy computer because the computer is easy to kill when outnumbered. Unfortunately, during these kinds of games, BackStabbers exist, who will wait until the computer is dead, look unsuspicious and then attack the remaining players with a huge force, all under the players' noses.
