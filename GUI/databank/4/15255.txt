synecdoche
a stuffy college professor word that describes when you use part of an object to refer to the whole object. If you call you gun a 'nine,' or refer to a guy who is mean as a 'dick,' thats synecodche. Like most college professor words, it is originally greek, transferred into Latin and then imported into english.
