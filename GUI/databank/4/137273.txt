schizophrenic template
A poorly organized web site full of insane ramblings, usually centered on the page, which change the color, font size, and capitalization of words at random. They often contain irrelevant links and pictures, page-long alt tags, and animated backgrounds. Such sites tend to be about religion, aliens, conspiracy theories, and dead babies.
