Scene Kids
Scene kids are pretty much taking over the world. ; a typical chick scene kid takes about 421984029358032495 pictures of herself in her newest Value Village or garage sale outfit looking down or to the side, she posts them on her myspace ; Scene girls also dye their hair in many random places with 'unique' colors, they are obsessed with a no name band that probably sucks. They typicly like Hardcore,screamo,techno,or emo. they put random techno songs that no one has ever heard because its 'different'. they wont think you are cool unless you have 234246 friends on myspace. ; a scene boy? yeah well they wish they were a scene girl. tight pants, eyeliner,and longish dark hair that is in there eyes. they can be dead sexy....but then get HELLA annoying. ; Scene kids are obsessed with robots and dinosours or anything that they think no one else likes. they are obsessesd with being Hardcore [HxC] and they do their makeup with a million different colors and eyeliners.
