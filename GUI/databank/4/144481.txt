Law of Rega-Reda
The Law of RegaReda , short for 'Real [Game] Release Date' is a formula that descibes the REAL release date of a [Game]. ; Game Makers usually announce that their games will be released on a certain day (eg. 23 september 2005) but due to some factors and variables (like bugs.. dependant on game size) the game is actually released days, or even months later (eg. 2 November 2005) ; The first Full Formula is: ; [ O = R + (P + (5^S)) ] ; Variables: ; O = Official Release date, the result of the formula. ; R = Release date , as given by the producer ; P = (expected) game price in stores, in dollars. ; S = (expected) game size in GigaBytes. ; S and P will be converted to a number of days in the formula. ; It was thought of by a team of [dutch] gamers (including me lol) who thought they would finally help out gamers that were waiting for a game to FINALLY COME OUT. ; It was based on the statistics of 6 different games, released throughout [2005] ; Although we don't even know if it really works oO (it does with most [EA] games but not with all of course) and we cant find a real suitable name for him.
