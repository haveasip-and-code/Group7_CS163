Zeta Reticuli I and II
Zeta Reticuli I and II form a star system which is supposedly the home to Zeta Reticulins, a race of aliens commonly referred to as the Greys. This system was first mapped out by Betty and Barney Hill after an abduction and thought to be fake but was discovered by astronomers as real in 1967. This star system is key evidence as proof of alien existance.
