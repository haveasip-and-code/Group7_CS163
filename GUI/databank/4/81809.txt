screetin
The face a [scumbag] (otherwise known as [spides],[scallys] or [chavs]) makes while squaring up to someone he/she wants to fight. the upper lip becomes rigid, drawing attention to their 'knacker tash' and the eyes bug out. Often accompanied by random pushing and taunts of 'ye wha!? oill bleedin morder yeh righ righ righ!?' aswell as scrawny birds in white tracksuits and hoopy earrings roaring 'leave im alowinn, Anto!' and so forth.
