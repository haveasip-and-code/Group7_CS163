zwicky
Zwicky is a lunar crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the west of the Aitken crater, and is attached to the western rim of Vertregt crater. Attached to the northern end of Zwicky is the Heaviside crater. ; This is a considerably eroded formation with an irregular rim and interior. Portions of the southern rim still survive, but the remainder has been almost completely eradicated. The satellite crater 'Zwicky N', located in the midst of the interior of Zwicky, has a relatively dark floor in comparison to the surrounding terrain.
