Many people consider this the most crime infested neighbourhood in Toronto, the drug dealers and gangs have leaked out to all directions of these streets for quite a while, it is comparable to some parts of LA or Chicago in '86. However there are still many phonies and doushbags who use the name of the neighbourhood to scare ppl when they have no back
