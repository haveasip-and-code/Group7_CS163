story of the year
Story of the year rok! They neva sed they were goth and they dont act lyk goth so why call them try hard goths? Unlyk Good charlotte who dress all punk an think they rok, soty just do wat they wanna do... and its awsum! Who cares if they talk abvout death a lot? I still think their lyrics are really good. And just because they r on MTV dusnt make them a mainstream shitty band. Im still the only 1 in my class who has herd of them but y dus that matta anyway. Trust me, if u wre in a band and got offered to b played on MTV I think u would accept! I saw them live at Taste of Chaos and they were mad and really no how 2 play! And for all those ppl that think they r just a shitty pop-punk/emo band go buy their new album 'In wake of determination'!!!! Very different,... one of the best cd's I've eva listened to. 'Is this my fate he asked them' is an amzing song!! The guitar at the start rocks!!!
