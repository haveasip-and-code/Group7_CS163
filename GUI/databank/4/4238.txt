Greeks
Two definitions apply ; a) A highly sophisticated Hellenic culture during the classical era of European history. Produced Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Pythagoras, Archimedes (in the then Greek colony of Sicily), Diogenes, and eventually Alexander the great. Also the inventors of Democracy. They spoke a vibrant language that is still studied today in order to read their beautiful poetry and profound philosophy. ; b) A group of hairy, backwards thinking male chauvinists and large, overprotective mothers who insist on reminding their children twice a day that 'there are only two kinds of people, those who are Greek and them that wish they was Greek' which they probably stole from 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' which by the way is one of the 4 to 9 films they've ever watched.
