The Fool on the Hill
Sorry, but the Fool on the Hill is John. Paul is the Walrus. Look at the example. Walrus was a term for someone who was dead. Everyone thought that Paul was dead and someone had plastic surgury to replace him. In the 2nd verse of Glass Onion, they sing that the Walrus was in fact Paul (in fact meaning they thought it was Paul, but no one was really dead) and in the 3rd verse, they sing that the Fool on the Hill is sitting there still, meaning that he is still alive.
