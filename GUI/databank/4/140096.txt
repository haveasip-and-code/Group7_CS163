schaumburg
Possibly the worst place on earth. Identical to every other suburbia just like it. All the houses were built in the 60's or 70's, falling down, and excatly the same as the house next to it. The only people living in this wasteland are old people and middle aged narcs with their preppy sons and daughters. All the kids play soccer, ride in huge SUV's that are totally unneccicary because its not excatly like schaumburg is in the middle of no where, and go to identical schools because the town was to cheap to hire different archutects. it is soon to be the future slum of america just like every other clone suberb out there.
