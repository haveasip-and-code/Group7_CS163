A place where you can get hotdogs wrapped in bacon at the 7/11, something I can't believe hasn't appeared all over America yet. ; A place where 90% of the people are extremely attractive, and obese people are hard to find. ; A place that will cost you an arm and a leg to visit because of the extremely high standard of living Norwegians enjoy - due in part to the country's massive oil reserves. ; The best place in the world to live, according to the UN.
