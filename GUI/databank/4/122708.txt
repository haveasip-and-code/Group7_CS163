zeromancer
A practitioner of an ultra modern form of witch craft started at the turn of the millenia, which combines technology and magick. The idea has been, and still is, regected by most practitioners of the old craft as it is seen as an insult to those who practice 'actual' magick. Uses attributes from Divination and some Nordic and Celtic witch craft, as well as any other forms that the Zeromancer feels could possibly work.
