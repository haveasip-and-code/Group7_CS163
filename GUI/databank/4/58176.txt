small talk
When you come across that person you haven't seen in a while, but you really have no close connection with them anyways. But you know... you don't want to be rude and just walk right past them... so then it turns to a complete bullshitting session between you and this aquiantence. ; Example conversation: ; 'YO! Hey whats up man? What you been doing?' ; 'Oh.. yeah I had a baby and shit...' ; 'Oh thats cool.....' ; 'OK BYE!' ; 'BYE!'
