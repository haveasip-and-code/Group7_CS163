Cubicide
Death caused by various office-related objects. This act of violence usually arises when a worker is micro-managed by his or her boss. Sometimes this act stems from the simple fact that a person is required to stare at a computer screen for 8 hours a day for 260 or more days per year. Symptoms include loss of vision from macular decay, increased procrastination to get projects done on time, and heart palptations from too much coffee.
