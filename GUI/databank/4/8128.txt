whomp
Whomp also comes from the late night TV show 'Showtime at the Apollo' where contestants compete in a talent competition. When people suck, a guy tap dances them off the stage and the audience yells, 'Whomp Whomp!! Whomp Whomp!!' ; You can also use just one whomp. ; whompity: the adjetive to describe things that deserve a hearty 'whomp, whomp'
