goth served
to be goth served is a higher degree of serving. it is from the [south park] episode that makes fun of the movie, [You Got Served]. In many circles it is condsidered a higher form of being served and more severe. Others think of it as being served about a [goth] (or, occasionally, other scene) faux pas. Still some believe the only way to be goth served it to be served by a goth. This includes any form of serveage. ; see: [serve], [You Got Served], or [goth]
