WWF Invasion
in 2001 WWF(now called WWE) were at War with WCW/ECW. Invasion was the start of it at as the main event was the best 5 of WWF vs WCW/ECWs 5 best (the conetenders were WWFs Angle Stone Cold undertaker Kane and Jericho WCWs Rhyno Booker T Diamond Dallas Page and the Dudleys). the outcome of the match was very suprising as Stone Cold turned on WWE by breaking booker out of Angles Angle lock stunnered Angle and forced WCW/ECW to victory. But of course the story behind this was that WWF had brought ECW and WCW in 2001 as well
