finals week
The worst week of a college or high school students life. Finals week involves pulling an all nighter to reverse the months of slacking that have killed their grades. Finals week involves a lot of stress and very little sleep, the college or highschool student will be on edge the entire time, thus it is not a good time to screw with them by playing practical jokes or something you might find funny.
