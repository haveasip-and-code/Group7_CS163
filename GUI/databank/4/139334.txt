Little Compton
Town made completely up of boarding school-rich snobs who sport too much green and pink and vineyard vines. If you do not own a luxury vehicle or million dollar house you will be looked down upon. The children spend mommy and daddy's cash on alcohol and drugs starting at a young age for fun since they can. It is an exclusive and competitive group of people, and everyone is the same. Preppy, rich, and not knowing what to do with their ridiculous amounts of money.
