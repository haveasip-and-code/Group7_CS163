UV
A brand of flavored vodkas. Though the line includes UV Green (Apple), UV Red (Cherry), UV Ivory (Vanilla), and UV Orange (Orange), the most popular is UV Blue, which is Blue Raspberry flavored. UV is good for mixing, but is often taken as shots by sorority chicks and other lightweight drinkers. Very popular at college parties, shots are often sold for $1.
