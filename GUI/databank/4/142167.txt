snowboarder
An entity, usually human, who straps a semi-oval board to their foot and procedes to either ; a. SHRED IT UP!!! Pulls sick tricks like triple backflip to 7000 degree turn while grabbing their board in five different places!!!! ; OR ; b. slide to the middle of a good run, sit down, ruin the run and never leave. (Perhaps waiting for hell to freeze over?)
