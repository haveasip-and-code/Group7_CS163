LAN hootenanny
n. A LAN party also meeting the parameters necessary for a [hootenanny], especially when occurring south of the Mason-Dixon line.

Solder on those connections is highly optional! Excessive use of duct-tape on, around, inside of, or across any computers at a LAN hootenanny should always be expected. Excessive use of the word [aight] is recommended for the full effect.
