Missouri
A terrible place filled with [pawns]/[hicks] and easily influenced girls who worship the cast of Laguna Beach. Every guy and girl in my highschool wears [Hollister] clothes that name places in [southern California] that they've never been to before. They think that [Orange County] is just like what [MTV] depicts them as. Most of the people here were born in Missouri, grew up in [Missouri], and will probably stay in Missouri for the rest of there lives. ; So, this is for every stupid hick and redneck that is reading this right now: Take of your California shirt, turn off MTV, and come to the realization that you are a stupid redneck who is from the [Midwest]. You are living a lie that's based on a lie. California is not what you think, even though it is the most beautiful and most fun place in the world. Laguna Beach is not the real Orange County. I was born and raised in Orange County, in Huntington Beach, but I had to move away for a semester. Now I know what a terrible place the Midwest is.
