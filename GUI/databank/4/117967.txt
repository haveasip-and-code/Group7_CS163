Emo person
Emo's are stereotyped as depressed people who cut, and have dark hair that covers 3/5 of their face, they wear converse, girl pants, and tight shirts. Okay, who came up with that. So, not true. Not even close. And emo person is someone who feels emotions very strongly. Hint, the word emo. Whether it be happy, sad, mad, whatever. And they don't have to dress or look a certain way either! Also, not all emo's cut. Some do some don't. Cutting, writing, going off alone, whatever, they do it as a way to express their emotion or release what they feel. ; Oh and BTW not all emo chicks are crazy about sex___
