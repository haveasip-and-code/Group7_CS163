Syttende Mai
The most important day in Norway-May 17. It is Norway's 4th of July. In 2005, Norway turns 100. It is celebrated all over the world whereever you can find people with Norsk backgrounds. I already have my bottle of Aquavit in the freezer to celebrate. It is mentioned often in Minnesota.
