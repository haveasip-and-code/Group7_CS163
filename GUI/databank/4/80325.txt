the new monkey
The latest internet craze. ; Taking from '[the new black],' (a phrase originally meaning 'the latest, hottest trend in fashion'), [the new monkey] works on the idea that for several years now [monkeys] have pervaded every corner of the internet--as mascot, icon, part of a slogan, or in some other aspect. ; 'The new monkey,' therefore, would be the next big thing. ; Usage note: 'The new monkey' refers to things that are in some way parallel to monkeys. Thus, bananaphones could be 'the new monkey,' but the [bananaphone] flash movie could not. ; For this reason (lack of a parallel), [All Your Base] is not the new monkey. Neither are monkeys the new [AYB]. (I suppose it could be argued that the Banaphone flash movie is the new AYB, but we all know that's simply not the case.)
