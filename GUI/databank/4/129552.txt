potsmoker's thumb
Noun. ; 1. A raw condition resulting from too much smoking of a substance through a hitter. When smoking through a one-hitter, the user has to continually light the substance over and over again because it does not stay lit in a hitter, creating a raw thumb. After awhile the lighter becomes very hot and even to the point of burning the user. Thus, everytime the user lights the substance, he not only wears out the skin on his thumb, but he burns it as well. *The condition consists of either raw, red skin on the inside of the thumb or loose, dead skin such as to burns.
