Hignett Suprise
This is a common strategy used by child molesters throughout the western hemisphere. This is when one roams parties scouting for young intoxicated females. The prey (the females) usually are completely passed out throughout this event and will have no recollection whatsoever. The [Hignett] (the sexual predator) will then violate the prey in numerous unorthodox activities until his molesting session is unbosomed. Once discovered, the [Hignett] then denies all activities that occurred that night and uses the excuse of being completely intoxicated (when he never took a sip of alcohol). At times the victim does awake, and the [Hignett] will flee from fear of being sued for the acts of the [Hignett Suprise] .
