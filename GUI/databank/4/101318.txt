Lonsdale
A clothing brand assosiated with antisocial behaviour in The Netherlands. ; This is normally worn by 14-17 year old youths who insist on defacing puiblic property, cars, people and anything else that comes in their way. ; They are strongly comparable to the [chav] groups which have infultrated the UK but the Londsdale groups have a sickening undertone of racism to add. ; On most evenings, the Lonsdale youth can be seen sat in parks and on street corners listening to Gabba techno smoking joints, drinking anything alcoholic and scribbling White power signs, 'Lonsdale never dies' or 'hardcore for life' on any surface that can be spoiled. ; They dont stop on public property but are also happy to wreck their own rented flats too. The communcal areas will have plants torn up, the lift will be urinated in and a nazi sign will be the calling card. The abundance of saliva from the constant spitting is also a recognisable sign that you are in Lonsdale territory. ; Sometime, the Lonsdale youth can be seen singing racist songs and chanting whilst walking through the street, this is only after 2:00 am when anybody who would happily stove their heads in really cannot be bothered to get up to do the honours. ; Typically, the Lonsdale youth can be found harrassing inocent bystanders, normally 10 year old children and when in large numbers will compete to see who can be the most obnoxious and irritate the f@#k out of the most people. ; The Dutch government has even had its security services look into the activities of these groups but it seems that it has been decided to let them be as they will all probably kill each other shortly.
