CPK
'COCOPLUM KILLERS.' These cool cats may often be seen drivingt around in their Hummers, Porsches, Mercedes, and BMW's. They and are invited to only the coolest parties in town. They can often be found tanning in their backyards with their 50+ foot yacht sipping booty juice and keeping in communication with their friends on their hip T Mobile Sidekick's. Allowance for chores? NO WAY! Not in Cocoplum where the maids walk the dogs and wipe their asses and are gladly paid for it. Miami's own Orange Country.
