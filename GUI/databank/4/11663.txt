bushtian
A person who calls themself a Christian, rigourously practices moral and righteous behaviour, but worships a political figure much more than Jesus Himself ; The Bushtian movement experienced the greatest growth during George W. Bush's first term in office, and climaxed, subsequently stabalizing during the 2004 re-election campaign, hence the word, 'Bushtian'.
