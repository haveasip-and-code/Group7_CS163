ten
A human being shaped so perfectly that their hotness is almost painful to look at: ; Boys; know you've met a ten when she tells you a joke and you accidentally spit coke in her face. ; Girls; know you've met a ten when the fact that he's even speaking to you makes you wet. ; Be careful! Tens know it. They have mirrors too. Their prettyness is so intense that you will forgive anything just to be around them. They are not always nice people.
