Courtney love
Courtney i fuckin hate you. not because i know you personally but for what you did not only to your husband and daughter but to his fans. you fucking killed him and you know damn right that you did! how can you live with yourself every day knowing that you left your baby daughter without a father and everyday you lie to her about how he died. if i was you i woudl kill MYSELF b/c i wouldnt be able to stand being a worthless lieing piece of shit liek you are. the only reason half your music did as well as it did is because kurt helped you write it and he was more talented then you were or will ever be. you killed him for the money, or maybe just because your an insane crack whore. either way, i fuckin hate you, and millions of people are still influenced today by his music, yet all of us are have been orphaned from the god of rock music because you had to be a fuckin bitch. burn in hell courtney.
