kilt
One of the worlds most recognised forms of national dress as worn by Scottish men both as formal wear with a jacket and as casual wear. ; Also worn by soldiers in Scottish regiments into many battles. Despite comments here Scottish regiments have some of the proudest heritage in the world. ; The kilt is a wonderful garment to wear as it is cool in summer and warm in winter and is also generally worn without any undergarments giving a wonderfully free sensation. ; Contrary to some opinions stated here, it is most certainly not a 'gay' item. In fact it probably takes more balls to wear one than those people have!
