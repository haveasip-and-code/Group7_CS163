The Iron Indian
The Iron Indian: A nickname bestowed upon the greatest man who will ever walk the Earth. He is untouchable in his grace and undefeatable in his element. Anyone who finds himself opposite The Iron Indian in a hostile situation should take out a sharp object and slit his wrists immediately to save himself the embrassment of total decimation.
