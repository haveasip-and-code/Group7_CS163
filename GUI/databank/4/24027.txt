madame
Noun, also 'madam.' Title for a woman who owns a brothel. Often one of the most powerful women in the world, a madame frequently has her phD and speaks multiple languages. She is neither pimp nor prostitute, but a classy and extremely wealthy combination of the two. Pimps and prostitutes work under her. She may sleep with her pimps as she choses, but never in exchange for money (though she pays them to see after her girls), for she is a sexually liberated woman. Her practice is limited in conservative countries like the United States, where such institutions as brothels are illegal.
