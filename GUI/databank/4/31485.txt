Semo
[Semo] is a word describing someone who likes chapped stick, listens only to the best bands like Relient K, Hawk Nelson, Underoath, Bleach, Mae, Anberlin, and most other Tooth and Nail artists. You surf, or some other kind of water sport, and have a love for wrist bands, and dressing up like your own favorite band. ; Came from a band named Achoowawa. 'Emo' kids say that you can't surf and be emo, and it just happens the lead drums, lead singers, and lead guitarists of Achoowawa do surf, so the 's' was added in front of emo.
