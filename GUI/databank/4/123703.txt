Yellowface
1. Refers to the practice in cinema or theatre of a non-Asian (typically white) actor/actress playing the role of an Asian character. More specifically, it refers to the use of makeup and prosthetics to give the actor a 'more Asian' appearance; also, actors often affect a heavy accent and/or speak in poor English. Related to 'blackface.' ; 2. By extension, can mean the practice of taking on an ethnically stereotypical persona; metaphorically, an Asian actor may be 'donning yellowface' merely by portraying an Asian character in an exaggerated and/or demeaning fashion.
