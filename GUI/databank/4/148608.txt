Fat Cat
Sandwich invented in New Brunswick, NJ on the campus of Rutgers University. Although many derivatives exist today, such as the 'Fat Darrell', voted best sandwich by Maxim Magazine, the original Fat Cat was engineered on a 'Grease Truck' (a rolling lunch truck) sometime in the late seventies. The original sandwich consists of two hamburger patties lined up on a sub roll, french fries, lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese and ketchup. It is then held closed with parchment paper wrapped around the lower 3/4 of sandwich holding all the ingredients in tightly.
