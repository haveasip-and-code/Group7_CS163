dufus dust
A delightful phrase used on the one of the networks show called Blossom. The Joey character said he was by the school bus and he hoped he didn't get any 'dufus dust' on him because he's so much (cooler) than those dorks on the bus. ; I thought the phrase was dumb at the time and haven't heard it since but I thought I share what can be fun to say.
