Sindy
It takes a second to fall in love with someone, takes 3 seconds to say I love you, takes a minute to kiss someone, takes a year to know someone, but it takes a life time to forgot someone. ; It took me a week to know your name, a month to know your beautiful mind, a season to understand your words, a year to feel your heart. And it's taken me sevens years to know, I love you, not for one day, but for a lifetime.
