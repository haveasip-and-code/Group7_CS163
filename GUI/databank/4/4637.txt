jazz kid/s
Kids whose parents brought them up listening nothing but jazz. They have to wear hand me downs especially faded blue jeans that incidentally look alright. They have been completely exposed to the whole jazz music culture thing since they were born and idolise the jazz legends. They stay up all night experimenting on their piano and attempt writing songs whilst drinking coffee to stay awake. Usually sorta poor and brought up on cheap snack foods like the [biscuit kid]. They hang out with their parents, uncles, aunts and that generation more than their peers. If the adults are drinking around them, the jazz kid will too, no big deal.
