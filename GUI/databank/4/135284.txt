gay dance
The unbelievably brilliant dance that [Stefan Olsdal], of the equally brilliant band [Placebo] does on stage, often but not limited to the song Taste In Men. I think he might have been gay dancing a bit during Protege Moi at Wembley 2004 but I'm not sure, I couldn't see very well.... ; The gay dance involves a lot of hip swinging, arms in the air and general sexual energy. Ask any Placbeo fan about it and they'll probably give you a demonstration.
