CaffeineLounge
CaffeineLounge is a great dAmn chat room. It has a bot, a .tk shortcut, and probably an insane guy. It was founded in late August of 04 by TheArcticBanana, referred to affectionately as Tab. Tab had a dream. He wanted to make a chat free from opression and spammers. He wanted to corral up all the sugarhighs and pack them in a box of gray. He hired chocolate-neko (Food-cat), j2n4me (j2), and Lil-Kris06 (Kris) to assist him (among others). Eventually, Atrocity-of-Life (Aol) joined the staff. ; CaffeineLounge has set many milestones. In November, operator j2n4me (with the help of others) created the first animutation in a format besides Flash. In December, CaffeineLounge had broadcasted a holiday webcast, before every other chat. ; CaffeineLounge continues to thrive today, serving as a home away from home for the cool and insane, and a place of hard work that never ends for its operators. Either way, you should go visit it today.
