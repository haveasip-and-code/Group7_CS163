Notorious BIG
Hands down one of the BEST rappers to have lived. Born and rasied in Bed-Stuy Brooklyn. Know for classic hip-hop albums such as 'Ready to Die' and 'Life after Death' A man to have 'Brought the East back' during the west-coast reign over rap music. Arguably the GREATEST MC to touch the mic.
