pulchritudinous
Despite all evidence to the contrary, [pulchritudinous] is used to describe a person of great physical attractiveness. No one is quite sure why this is, because the word *sounds* like something unpleasant on the bottom of your shoe. ; This is possibly due tothe fact that it shares sounds with words such as [sepulchre], [repulsive], [cretin], [lewd], and [pus]. ; It's a good word to use when you'd like someone to *think* you're insulting them. ; It is in no way synonymous with [lugubriousness]. But it should be.
