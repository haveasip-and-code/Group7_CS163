trickle down
A fairy tale told by Republicans. Based on the idea that if rich people are given Uber-Welfare in the form of tax credits, that they may throw a few crumbs to the rest of us, which somehow benefits us (even though the crumbs we get don't equal the money we've handed over to the rich). see also: [absolute bullshit] ; Made popular under the Reagan Administration, it was his Republican primary opponent George Bush (Version 1.0) who coined the term [voodoo economics] to describe the principle. This, of course, was before it dawned on Bush that he was a rich bastard himself and should probably just keep his mouth shut. ; Called trickle down as an endearing visual of the upper 1% pissing all over the less fortunate.
