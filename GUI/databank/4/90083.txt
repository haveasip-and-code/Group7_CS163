A-3-5-O
Acronym used to describe a particular subset of the female population who are usually unpleasant to the hearing ear and to the clear mind. Acronym stands for: 'Angry 35 year old'. These A350's are women who are mad they are not happily married so they're just a drag...but they think they're hot.
