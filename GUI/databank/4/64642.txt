True Blue Falcon
A bastardization of two contradictory terms. True Blue is a dated naval/sailing term meaning honest and loyal to a unit or cause. Blue Falcon is used in the modern Army to designate a 'Buddy F**ker', that is someone who is not a team player and displays no unit loyalty. Implies a more negative meaning when the terms are put together in this way: True(as in real,bigtime) Buddy F**ker.
