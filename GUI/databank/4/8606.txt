Ad Council
The American Ad Council produces advertising materials across all media to promote values beneficial to the American public, or some such ridiculousness. Failed crusades include the war on drugs, the war on smoking, the war on teen pregnancy, and, more recently, the war on being fat. Ad Council commercials tend to be smarmy, overbearing, and idiotic.
