FLQ
A totally badass Quebecois terrorist group who shoved a huge stick up the Federal Government's ass in the 1970's. They kidnapped trade minister Pierre LaPorte and some British diplomat nobody cared about. ; Their Manifesto of '79 rivals only that of Karl Marx. ; The FLQ are generally known to have become active after the famous words, 'Vive le Quebec libre' were spoken by De Gaulle on a Montreal balcony.
