FZ20
The second generation digital camera from Panasonic's FZ line (after the original FZ10). The 5 megapixel FZ20 has an almost cult like following, as most (often obsessed) owners can be found under the Panasonic forum at Dpreview.com. The biggest stand out feature is it's impressive optical image stabilised 432mm zoom (12x optical) with f/2.8 throughout the entire range. Can be obtained in dark black or sleek silver. Also nicknamed the legendary 'Fluzi'.
