iToilet
The 'iToilet' is a prototype for a new range of 'iPod white' toilets soon to be released from Apple. The famous 'click wheel' that the 'iPod' is known for will be placed on the top of the toilet and users can select the strength of their flush. The 'iToilet' boasts a PooPoo viewer and Anti-skid. It features WiFi and can download, what Apple calls, 'Song Flushes' which will turn on a popular song when you flush. A song that's found it's way to be most popular and downloaded by users is Bachman Turner Overdrive's 'Takin Care of Business'. The iToilet does not support No.3 and has a label reading 'Taking laxatives it wrong.'
