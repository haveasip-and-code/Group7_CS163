nocal
Short term for Northern California, [norcal] is another term used mainly by nocalers A place with a massive inferiority complex to their neighbors to the south (socal). A socaler's first trip to nocal is always a shock due to the fact that they usually find out about this massive inferiority complex. Comments about the smog and that socalers steal their water will always come us. ; This comes to a surprise to most socalers because growing up in places like: LA, OC, San Diego, Long Beach, and even the the meth-infested Riverside, socalers do not care about nocalers. Nocal never cross the mind of socalers unless they visit there or they meet a travelling nocaler. For some reason nocalers are obsessed with hating socal even though they love to visit Disneyland. It can be compared to the New Englanders hating New Yorkers. ; The capital of nocal is San Francisco. Referred as 'the city' by nocalers even though it is only 7 mi X 7 mi large (a fraction of the size of the San Fernando Valley section of LA). All the cool things in nocal are relegated to 'the city' because nocalers love to live bland lives. Inland nocal is Sacramento and places like Redding, Modesto, and Lodi, all full of white trash and rednecks. The Bay Area sans SF is chalk full of lilly-white liberals who speak of equal rights but are too afraid to go to black or Latino neighborhoods. This is another underlying reason for their hate for socal. All the Bay Area suburbs are geographically segregated and suburbs like Walnut Creek, Napa, and Pleasanton stay lilly white while Los Angeles area suburbs are all intermingled. Bay Area residents do not like to mention this and like to keep up their liberal facade.
