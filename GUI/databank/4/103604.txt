The 5678's
A brilliant band from japan, playing since the late ninties there music is a blend of music from the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's. They have releases many cd's, their most recent being Teenage Mojo Workout. They known for their cover of the song woohoo, and if you disliked that, their other music isnt just 2 words repeated. They cameoed in [Kill Bill] Vol. 1. Anyway, there a really good band so get out and buy bomb the rocks!
