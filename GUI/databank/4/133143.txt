ring and run
a game young kids play, 1 kid would go up to a persons house and ring their doorbell, and then run away, but not to far so you can see the owner open the door and look outside...hence the name 'ring and run' ; nowadays people don't open doors, they ask who is it? or look through a keyhole...FYI
