boat problems
The easiest type of problems on the New York State Regents Exam for physics. You use vectors to determine how fast a boat will go in a certain direction based on the velocity of the boat and the velocity of the current. If vectors are 90 degrees to each other, you use Pythagorean's theorem and viola, you have your answer. QED
