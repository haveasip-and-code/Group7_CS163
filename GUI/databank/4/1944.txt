keanu reeves
One of the most criticized and misunderstood actors today - except for those who really get him. He's simply a human being who is searching for the answers to those questions most people that attempt to use their brain and tap into their emotions also look for - the meaning life, etc. who uses his job to explore those questions/answers...a job that gives him the attention he tries to avoid which many people think give them the right to criticize and ridicule him. He's a regular Joe who happens to be an actor. If you like his acting, you'll watch his movies. If you don't like him why waste your time to ridicule someone who still has the last laugh? Regardless of what you say, he makes a lot more money than you!
