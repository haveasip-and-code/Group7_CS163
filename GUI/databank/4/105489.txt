White Settlement
A little town around Ft. Worth, Texas. If you outline the main highways between Ft. Worth and Dallas, you'll see why they call the area 'the Big D.' (It looks like a big dick) Dallas is the balls and Ft. Worth is the head of the dick. White Settlement lies just within the 'shooting area' of the dick head that is Ft. Worth.
