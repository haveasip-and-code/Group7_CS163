Yo Mama Joke Protest
The revolt and protest organized by people who hate or disagree with [Yo mama] jokes. These uproars of protest and disgust usually come from mothers, and sometimes fathers. Most of the time they are posted via Internet or emailing to sites, but occasionally mobs of moms will get really physical. Here is a prime example of protest: this message left by a working mom on www.joke-pages.com: ; 'You can kiss my two cakes togetha losers!!! You all dissin me on dis here computer callin me FAT when you da fat asses eating yo krispy kremes and stickin it around yo penis's and dilly do's!!!! ; I'm tired of all these yo momma jokes, I mean seriously, what about yo fatha?!?!!
