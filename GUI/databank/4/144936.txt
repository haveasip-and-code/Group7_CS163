Finergy
A sub-genre of [Freeform] and [Happy Hardcore] music, originating from Finland. Finergy was created in the last couple of years most notably by Alek Szahala, Carbon Based, Re-form, Epilim and Pain on Creation. This style blends elements of [Trance] such as the uplifting synth apreggios and 4/4 kickdrums with the speed and intensity of hardcore, resulting in a very unique style of music much different to [Happy Hardcore]. Since it's growing popularity many freeform tracks have been signed to respected hardcore labels such as Electronic and Camel Records. As the UK hardcore culture and it's beliefs of Love, Peace and Unity ([PLUR]) falls to pieces after the commercialism it recieved from chart remixes on All Around The World records, the people are looking to europe to light the way...
