llow
I believe this to have originated from chavs/townies/mods of today. From what i have observed and practiced this word usually replaces a >doing word< such as 'pass' or 'come' etc. This may be a regional thing but it does save alot of effort even if you are not a chav. ; Some unfortunate people are unable to grasp this concept and just use the word 'llow' in the wrong place as shown below.
