are we here?
this is an infinately more irritating variation on the infamous 'are we theeeeere yet?' question, which is relentlessly asked by bored children on long car jouneys. ; whereas the question 'are we there yet?' makes sense - seeing as you're talking about the place that you are HEADING to that you haven't actually REACHED yet - the question 'are we here?' (which is asked as the journey is drawing to a close) is entirely infuriating. the reason is this: whenever, and WHEREever, you utter this question, the answer will always be 'yes! of course we're 'here' you silly child!! you could at least ask an annoying question that makes SENSE!!' ; jees...
