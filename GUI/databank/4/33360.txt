Lu Bu
A warrior who has much untruth told about him. He was not unbeatable. At the battle of Hu Lao Pass, Winter 191 A.D. Lu Bu was beaten by The Tiger Of Jiang Dong, Sun Jian and forced to retreat. He would never have been able to fend off even 2 brothers, let alone 3 (also, the 3 brothers did not participate in the campaign against Dong Zhuo). ; Later, although people think he was bound whilst asleep by Wei Xu and Song Xian, realistically he actually surrendered to Cao Cao and was then bound. ; He wasn't very intelligent, and also could never had stood up to Dian Wei.
