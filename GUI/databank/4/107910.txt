rower
rowers: a group of people who voluntarily go outside at 5:30 am to practice. They row through sun, rain, snow, and 12 degree weather. They carry their $30,000 boats over their heads down slippery docks with a serious lack of traction. Clothing articles of choice are spandex,sweatpants, and more spandex, which is good for showing off their super hot, super huge quad muscles. They have been known to spend 12-14 hours on a bus together to travel to races in horrible weather. For 6 weeks during winter training, these deranged athletes ravage and ruin their bodies on ergs (read: the rowing machines you incorrectly use at the gym) for the satisfaction of seeing a good time on their screen. They can jump on waist-high boxes on one leg, run faster than you, and they can probably bench press your body weight. While they normally have a lame to nonexistent social life, they completely shut down during coach-induced dry season. This is the life of a rower.
