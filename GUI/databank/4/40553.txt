skinhead
A person with a shaved or cropped head, wearing a Flight Jacket, Fred Perry or Lonsdale shirt, cammo's or bleachers and 14 or more hole combat boots. Typical for a skinhead gang are the strong ties of friendship between the members. Many have a preference for aggro (agressive behaviour), also amongst themselves. Only a few are racist. In Europe 'gay' skinheads outnumber the 'straight' ones. Skinhead history is less important for a skin himself than for the ones writing about them.
