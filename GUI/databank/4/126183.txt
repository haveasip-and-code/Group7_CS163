Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that {n: n is an element of N > 1} (the set of natural numbers, or positive integers, except the number 1) can be represented uniquely apart from rearrangement as the product of one or more prime numbers (a positive integer that's divisible only by 1 and itself). This theorem is also called the unique factorization theorem and is a corollary to Euclid's first theorem, or Euclid's principle, which states that if p is a prime number and p/ab is given (a does not equal 0; b does not equal 0), then p is divisible by a or p is divisible by b.
