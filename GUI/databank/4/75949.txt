MAD
Recently acquired by [DC Comics], it's the best humor magazine EVER. Sure, there's a handful of commercial advertisements in its pages nowadays, but who cares about that? ; Features content such as movie/TV show satires, Spy Vs. Spy, offbeat comic strips, etc. MAD's mascot since its inception, Alfred E. Neuman, is on every cover in some humorous fashion. ; The magazine has also spun-off a fairly good TV series, 'Mad TV,' which airs in reruns on Comedy Central. Basically, Saturday Night Live on steroids. ;-)
