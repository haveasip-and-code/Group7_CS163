Drizzle
Tall, lanky, and a baby soft body that has yet to see the completeness of puberty, Drizzle is a creature that will annoy the hell out of you with his sly antics. Do not be fooled by his apparent bounty of wisdom, as you will soon find out you are living a hellish nightmare of old movie and Comedy Central TV show quotes.
