Fur Down
In the gay fetish community, referring to a particular Male on Male intercourse position, with a large bodied and exceptionally hairy man often known as Bears and usually a smaller smooth shaven Male (though not always). In this position the Bear male lies on the edge of a couch, bed or flat elevated surface upon his back (hence, 'Fur Down'), with legs lifted pointing to the ceiling, tightly held together, offering his rectum for penetration by the partner. Variations then occur between completely submissive Bear, to Bear wrapping his calves around his partners head, invoking a choking effect that pleasurably asphyxiates the partner.
