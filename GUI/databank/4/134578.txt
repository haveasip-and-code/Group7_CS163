cigarette jeans
super tight, almost painted on pants. prominent in kids with the 'punk' style. sometimes with patches, zippers, bleached, sewed, or buttoned. i think its extremely hot. the pants are tight all the way down, from your hipbones (make them super low cut) to your knees, they arent baggy anywhere. they should be like scotch tape for your pants.
