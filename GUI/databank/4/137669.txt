Tripple P
A Drunk or High card game you play. It involves taking all the cards and dealing them out with anywhere from 3-5 people. From there... you all count and on 3 pick up your cards. right away you start trying to make pairs or tripples or quaddrouples. if you dont ahve at least two of a card you yell out the number of the card until someone matches up with you. Only then can u put that card down, once they are all in matches and you have no cards you tell out that your done. (whoever gets out first wins etc).. then play again.. you can make it drinking game by losers drink.
