Alternachav
These people who turn up every now and then to alternative venues becuase they think its for them (for the night, as the rock chick look is in this week!). They come complete in the 'right' outfit, generic baggy jeans/a rocking kilt(very punk!) a top from eg-New Look that says something like 'punk rock chick' on it. They might also be wearing stripey socks and have recently dyed their hair black, or be wearing a hat, possibly a trucker cap. All the other time they can be found living chavish lives, and wont openly admit to people they think about 'alternativeness', just as at an alternative venue they wont admit to liking anything except err umm greenday! they rock!
