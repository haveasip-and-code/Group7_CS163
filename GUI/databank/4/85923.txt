Smackdown
(-- Actually spelled [WWE Smackdown!] The [!] is VERY Important!) ; SteelPhenoix's Definition & Example had this down pact. But I'll add on. ; The WWe show made up by Vince McMahon where wrestlers in the WWe go to job to Bradshaw every tuesday night. ; Smackdown's only Popular and Good superstars are [Kurt Angle] and [The Undertaker]. ; Smackdown's Popular, yet sucky stars are [John Cena], Bradshaw aka John 'Bradshaw' Layfield aka [JBL], [Rey Mysterio] (he's a frikkin' cruiserweight!) , and [Eddie Guerrero]. (And HE was actually once [WWE] Champion!)
