blee
Found among the Royal Court of Princess Peussie and her sister Princess Fluff, the word BLEE is usually followed by JOHNNY....making it Blee Johnny; this expression of joy only happens when a member of this royal family has had a great bowel evacuation without use of enemas or colonic irrigations!
