San Marcos
SM is an awesome city! located in [north county san diego]...its a pretty small city but is fast growing. layed back people..skaters,surfers,potheads,gangsters,emo kids, you name it, we got it. although it seems like SM is split apart now that there are 2 different high schools. theres the mission side and the smhs side. n-78 and s-78...you wouldnt understand unless you live here.
