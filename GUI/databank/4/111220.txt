Contralto
The lowest womyn's singing voice; at the bottom of their range, they sound almost like men, often leading to people mistaking them for men on the radio, telephone, or wherever. ; The [alto] range, which is below [soprano], is really an easy combination of the [mezzo-soprano] range and the contralto range; the mezzo-soprano is the medium female voice and therefore the higher of the two.
