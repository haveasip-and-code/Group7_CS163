suped
ADJ: [excited]; extremely happy. ; VERB: [improved]; made cooler and more advanced (a synonym to [amped] and [pimped], often used with the adverb form of [up]). ; Note: Suped is often spelled incorrectly; many people spell it 'souped'. It is derived from the word 'super' not the word 'soup,' thus making it 'suped' and not 'souped.'
