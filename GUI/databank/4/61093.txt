California Speed
A game in which two players receive 26 cards and keeps them in their hand, face down, in a stack. The players then take the top four and lay them down, one by one, face up in front of them, near the other person's cards. Each player then tries to quickly place cards from their stack on top of pairs in the eight cards. If no pairs can be found, each player takes the four cards they laid down, in addition to any cards laid on top of them, and place them on the bottom of their deck. It is then repeated until one player runs out of cards, slaps the table, and declares 'Speed!'
