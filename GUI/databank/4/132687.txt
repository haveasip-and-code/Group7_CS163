Pelican Bay
A 275 acre California State Penitentiary located in Folsom, California. Was built for the sole purpose of housing California's most serious criminals in an extremely secure environment. Features a Level 4 Security Housing Unit which holds 1,300 of some of the most violent criminals in the United States. SHU inmates are guaranteed at least 23 1/2 hours a day in solitary confinement. It is arguably the most notorious prison in the United States today, due to the fact that there are 1,600 Level 4 GP (general population) inmates that are mostly gang members, and they have no problems killing rival inmates and guards.
