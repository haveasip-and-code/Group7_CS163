Ocarina of Time
Ocarina of Time (OoT) is often considered the greatest game of all time. Shortend from 'The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time', the game was the first N64 port of the series. Product sales sky-rocketed and easily became the most popular game of the year. Sporting fancy 3D graphics, an outstanding musical score, and gameplay which no other game at the time could rival. ; Ocarina of Time quickly became the number 1 game on the N64, one of the only games (maybe THE only game) to recieve a perfect 10 score on IGN.com. Nearly 10 years after the games debut, it now holds the title of number 1 video game of all time on most video game databse sites.
