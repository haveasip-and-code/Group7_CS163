Hip-Hop
Hip Hop is a sorry excuse for music. Whatever happened to singing about emotion, rather than endorsements? And now you've gone and inspired a bunch of white kids with their EXCO and FUBU and $700 shoes to go get shot... no one likes a wigger. Often the people that listen to it dress like thugs. The white kids(I mean kids, because no respectable adult would buy into such shit) all of a sudden learn ebonics and talk poorly. They all think that people respect them. They don't, people just think they're fucking criminals.
