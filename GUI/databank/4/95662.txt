humpy
(adj.) used to describe a person, usually male, whose body is beautifully sculpted or 'humped' with muscles. Having this characterstic typically makes him 'humpable,' although not in the case of such humpy persons as Lou Fariggno or that annoying blond australopithecine who sells exercise equipment on infommercials.
