samaritan
A [Catholic] school in [Preston], a suburb of [Melbourne], [Australia] with a high [Muslim] population to the point where the actual Catholics don't go to school on Islamic holidays due to the decline in attendence. ; A school where the dodgy teachers only last 3 months, to get some experience in their first year out of teacher's college, before having a mental breakdown and moving on to greener pastures (even if they are rolling across them in straightjackets). ; A school which spends money on things like self promotion when there is nothing of value to promote (see the recently decommissioned purple and yellow '[Samaritan tram]' as a case in point). Despite the fact that the school oval is an oblong and the basketball court has no basketball rings. ; A school which spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a lift for disabled students, got the archbishop in to bless it, and saw the only disabled student leave the school. ; A school that tried to enforce uniform standards and got the response 'Sir, are you trying to make this like a rich school or sumfink?' No child, that's impossible... ; Samaritan, pretension is our aim!
