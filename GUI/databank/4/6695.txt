koro
Also known by the name 'shook yong', koro is a mental disease prevalent among East Asian males, the symptoms of which are chiefly an irrational fear that the subject's 'membrum virile' will disappear up into his body. ; Sufferers often resort to the use of elaborate clamps or clasps to alleviate the fear.
