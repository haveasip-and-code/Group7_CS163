Pantomime
1. To act out in a very over the top way. ; 2. A truly mad old English tradition still performed today of rampant cross dressing and [Carry On] style humour performed on stage primarily for kids. ; Extremely popular at Christmas and always traditionally contains the phrase 'It's behind you!' no matter what the production. Also the place where z-list celebs earn their keep. ; Completely [hatstand]! All Americans should catch one when in [Blighty], as it will pop their heads!
