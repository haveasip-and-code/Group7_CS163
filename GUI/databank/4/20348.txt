Trans Am
LS1 Ram Air or not. Vs Mustang GT, It kills it. ; Vs Mufflers, or those thing kids try to build that actually cost about 200,000 to get them up to speed. Destroys them. ; These cars are proven to be the fastist stock of the lot under 30 grand cars. 12.9 1/4 Mile 340 to 350 hp. ; I only had the car one week.And about 6 imports tried to race me. I was even shocked. Forget winning by bumper lenghts. Try about 7 car lengths. In about a 1/4 mile. I raced everything since 5 years old, I was born in the City 'not a trailor park' live high class. Tried to make about 3 diffrent imports fast. It just did not work. So had to buy a real car. And this car devistates almost all rice out their stock. And if its not stock! LOL forget it. You cant beat it.
