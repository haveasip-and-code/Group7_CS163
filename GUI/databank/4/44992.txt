Lineage II
MMORPG game made by NCsoft. One of the greatest games I can think of. If you wanna play for free, just join L2Extreme or any other private server, they run on donations only. Lineage II has five races: ; Human, Light Elves, Dark Elves, Orcs and Dwarves (which earn lots of cash, they can produce items with skills and by using materials and recipes), Orcs are the toughest race (most HP, can take more beating), Dark Elves (my personal favorites) are the more calm type, has Shillien Oracle -> Elder that have good buffs like Empower. Light Elves are pretty similar to Dark Elves but far from the same. Light Elf archers are the fastest shooters. And last, but certainly not least, Humans, which are probably the best race (...yay...) because of all the different occupations and proffesions you can take. ; NOTE: THs and Prophets own :D
