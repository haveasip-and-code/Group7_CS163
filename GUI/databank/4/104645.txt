The Hammer
One of the first performance Mercedes' made by AMG. The car was the tiny 300E body with a tuned 6 liter conversion of the 5.6 liter V8 from the 560SEC. The engine, bored and stroked with new headers and 4 valves per cylinder, put out close to 400 horse power. A Renntech version produced 440bhp and 440lb. ft. of torque. The engine was so big, the entire electrical system was moved to the trunk and the cooling system was converted to electrical to conserve space. One of the greatest sleepers of all time, this car can beat most anything out on the road. With more power than a modern Corvette and the modest looks of the 300E 2.8, this is an amazing collector vehicle that is worth a look.
