crow jim
Commonly referred to in [PC]-speak as 'Reverse' Racism, Crow Jim is precisely what it implies: racial discrimination against whites by black people. This is usually borne out of perceived racial inequality, rampant poverty and corruption, or as a simple act of misdirected vengeance for the South's segregationist attitudes and policies before the Civil Rights Era in the 1960s.
