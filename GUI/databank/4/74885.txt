Kisame
Niberu's lead guitarist, Kisame is a force to be reckoned with. Once a member of the Mist's Seven Legendary Swordsmen, and then a high ranking officer of the elite rebel group known as Akatsuki, Kisame now roams the urban wastelands, entertaining adults and children alike with his frenetic riffs and earth-shattering solo's.
