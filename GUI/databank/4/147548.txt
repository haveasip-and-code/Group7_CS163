Keepin' the Dog in the Bath
The physical act of not only inserting ones testicle into another's anus during sex, but keeping it there for as long as possible. Generally anal sex is conducted before doing this in an effort to essentially 'loosen things up.' This 'move' is performed by [perve]s and shady boombastiqua's alike and is only recommended for such types (see [shaddy boombastique]). People on steroids with something to prove may actually attempt to insert both testicles simultaniously, although many believe this to be impossible (including myself). ; *Note: 'This shit is hard.' ; **Note: Keep in mind that you are on your own. Post-coital conversation following this act may be extremely awkward.
