HARDCORE DANCING
Hardcore dancing is performed at hardcore shows to hardcore music and as described in these other definitions it did show up in the early 80's. Contrary to what others have posted it didn't start when a bunch of straight edge kids made the hardcore punk scene. The hardcore punk scene was already established before the straight edge scene was formed. Some of these kids may have dedicated themselves to human rights but not many did. Hardcore dancing then was called the HB strut or the Hannigan. These kids had a lot of energy and started throwing fists in the pit. At this time hardcore dancing wasn't a few kids doing windmills. It was a mob of kids beating each other. It was extremely physical. These moves didn't have any meaning and they most certainly did not represent fighting fascists and those who supressed the scene. Hardcore kids today are mostly assholes who won't let people mosh. They run into mosh pits and start windmilling. They don't pick up people that have fallen. They just simply kick them when they're down. They don't try and calm someone down whos trying to start shit. They take cheap shots at them. They fight in gangs rather than fighting alone.
