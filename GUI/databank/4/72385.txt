ZaDR
ZADR is a lovely acronym for Zim and Dib Romance/Relationship. It has it's roots deep in... well, people trying to find out how to say 'hot human/alien sex inside' while still staying PG ;P. No, seriously, it came out of just [slash] culture and a bunch of other crap besides. I still stick by the definition above, though. It tends to be shounen-ai, if not blatant yaoi. Some of it IS good though.
