PHI
Nonsical number with remarkable properties like PI. It is often refered to as 'The Golden Ratio', 'The Golden Mean' or 'The Divine Proportion'. Is commonly reduced down to 1.618. A lot of things in nature follow this ration but it is now quite known why yet. PHI has been popularised by 'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown, which can't be a bad thing as it makes people more aware of this remarkable number. A lot of renaissance painters and architects used it in their work, but it has been used for a lot longer. The ancient Greeks were aware of PHI and the ratio can even be traced back to Pagan times.
