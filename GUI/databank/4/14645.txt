chav
The humble chav, aka scum. These simple creatures walk the earth clad in as many fake lables as they can fit on their puny, weak, little bodies. Their language consists of...well if we could work it out im sure it would make sense to someone. Commonly seen in 'crews' of about...2500 hanging around on street corners drinking the o so delightful bottle of 'white lightning' bragging about how many 'mother fuckers' they managed to father in a space of a week. ; Chavettes, aka sluts, are commonly found pushing a lovely pushchair(probably stolen off some unsuspecting passer by) round and round followed by a crowd of possible 'fathers' of the poor little socially rejected child. ; These creatures somehow aquire a liking for hip hop/r&b and burberry. Chavs seem to have a 'limp' which means one side of their body has 2 flop mysteriously to one side in unison, carefully avoiding puddles and any signs of dirt that might affect the pristine white reebok classics.These creatures somehow aquire a liking for hip hop/r&b and burberry. Often seen wearing matching fake tracksuits and chav caps, these individuals like to pick fights with little children or old aged pentioners(who would probably beat them in a fight anyway). They drive round and round the local one way system revving up their 'blingin' peices of chavved up metal they call cars or little scooters that they probably havn't even got a licence for...using up all the petrol they probably more than likely stole from someone elses car. ; These things could possibly be captured but unfortunately i think there is a law that says we can't. However the art of chav hunting is still free so help the cause and go chav hunting!
