megaton
In videogame folklore, when an announcement is due to be made that will 'shake the foundations of gaming to its core', it is referred to as the 'megaton'. It inevitably turns out to be completely lame and non-eventful. Like perhaps a competition to go to some Xbox360 party in the US by yourself.
