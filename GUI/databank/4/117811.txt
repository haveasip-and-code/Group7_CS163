tape up
Also known as a taper. A type of haircut originally attributed to young urban black men and then popularized by 5th generation 16-26 year old Italian-Americans living in the New York/New Jersey suburbs. It is like a fade that stops right above the ear and about 2-3 inches above the neckline, allowing the hair on the rest of the head to be longer. If taken to the next level, by meticulously putting 3 pounds of gel onto the scalp and twisting locks of hair into 'spikes,' it becomes a [blow out]. Accessories required to complete the 'neo-guido' look: Black Armani Exchange/FCUK sleeveless shirt, Diesel Jeans, Armani Exchange belt, tasteless 'jewel' encrusted necklace and/or watch, white Nike Air Force Ones, orange tan in the middle of December, waxed eyebrows, fake Brooklyn accent, IQ less than 90, Nextel permanently flipped open and implanted into the right hand, entry level luxury car or 'hooked-up' ricer with italian flag reflector above the rear fender, Growing up Gotti Season One DVD. Italian heritage not necessary.
