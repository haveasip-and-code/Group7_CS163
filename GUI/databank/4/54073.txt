Pataskala  Ohio
Quite possibly the worse place on earth. It used to be quite a cute little country town, but it has been run to hell by a new breed we call Rich white trash. The pretend to be poor and ghetto, but mommy and daddy really pay for them to dress head to toe in Urban Styles. It's 20 miles away from columbus, and the high school is called Watkins Memorial. The only ones who love pataskala are the alumni of WMHS who dropped out of College and can't make any new friends outside of their little circle.
