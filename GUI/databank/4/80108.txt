In and Out Burger
A burger chain found in only the West coast. The menu consists of A cheese burger, Hamburger, double double (two patties on that bitch!), fries sodas and shakes. You don't have to semd your whole god damned day deciding what you want like those other lame sauce chains like Mc D's. Also can be a breakfast lunch or dinner food. Even has a catchy little theme song. And is pretty cheap.
