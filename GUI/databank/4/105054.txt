Armored Core
An arcade-style mecha fighting game where you pit custom buitl robots against opponents for the PS series of consoles. ; Great game spanning soon to be all 4 of Sony's PlayStation consoles. Although initially it would appear none of the American versions had online, you could tunnel into Master of Arena and Nexus to get online. In my opinion the best game series for the Playstation line of consoles. ; It had several infamous villans, including (but not limited to) Nineball, Stinger, and Leos Klein. ; If you can find it, get it. It's hard at first, but the more you play, the more fun it gets.
