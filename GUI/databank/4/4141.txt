Colonel Sanders
The Colonel was one of the leaders of a revolutonary guerrila movement against livestock. Sanders was much like his communist counter part Che Guevera. Sanders, originally from Kentucky, rose to fame when he and his squad composed of Kentucky's finest fried chicken cooks launched a daring raid on old Wally Smith's farm. Smith, out numbered and out gunned, surrendered the chicken to Sanders and his rag-tag crew of chicken cooks. Upon hearing this General McDonald, who was the originator of the guerrila movement, promoted capitan Sanders to a full colonel in the guerilla army. General McDonald went on to establish the pouplar fast food joint McDonalds. Colonel Sanders went on the fine dining establishment we know today as Kentucky Fried Chicken or KFC.
