350Z
A fine looking sportscar made by Nissan; well put together and good looking. However, it is a small bit overrated. Car and Driver rated it's roadholding capabilities up to .88 g's, for a comparison, the 1985 IROC-Z was capable of handling up to .92 g's. ; It is also overrated with power; the VQ35DE has from 246lbs of torque to 287lbs of torque, where a 1991 305 Z28 Camaro was making 300lbs of torque, and the 350 was making 345, 15 to 20 year old 'low tech' cars! ; overall, a very nice car, but just a TAD bit over rated by the import crowd.
