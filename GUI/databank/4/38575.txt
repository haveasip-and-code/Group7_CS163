Hayes
A word of endearment. First used by a fake basketball playing numnuts who couldn't remember his damn lines at the Black Man's assembly. Instead of reciting his lines like he was supposed to, he instead used words on stage such as 'Oh Snap' and 'as...as...as.' Due to his theatrical incapabilities, he made all of the brothas look like fools in front of the whole audience. And after the performance, he finally spat out a word that everyone could decipher 'hayes' and reached for a nice comfy shoulder to cry on. Therefore, the word HAYES is a term for those who would rather cry after the performance than take care of business.
