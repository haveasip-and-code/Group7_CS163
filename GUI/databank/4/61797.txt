SLOW
Originated on the GameArena messageboards (www.gamearena.com.au) and was short for 'Secret Language Of Women'. It started off as a thread in which a widely distributed email containing satire of what women mean when they say certain phrases was posted. ; The thread has spawned duplicates after each subsequent thread was locked and is today a haven for Telstra employees to converse as it's not blocked by their company firewall. ; The thread titles of SLOW vary and usually involve a pun or something that incorporates the word 'slow'.
