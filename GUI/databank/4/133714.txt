faux queen
a woman who dresses as a drag queen. Also known as a 'genetically-challenged' drag queen, because acting flambuoyant and dressing over-the-top can be a lot of fun for some women. The woman may not be [heterosexual], but [bisexual], or a [lesbian], or refer to herself as a [dyke]. ; Comes from 'faux' meaning fake - 'drag' + 'queen.' ; As of the time of this writing, there are no known faux kings. (See: [drag king].)
