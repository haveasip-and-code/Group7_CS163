VGL = Video Games Lounge. A chat room that has existed in the AOL Video Games section for many years in which about 20 people--fluctuating off and on--called 'home.' Renmazuo, DarkstalkrR (Gamearts), Wren(Random#s), EVAUNITII, RyuuKotei, Soul4ger were just a few of its members. The chat room existed since at least 1996 (and possibly before that time). Its rival, 'The War Room' (ANT AOL) started a few years after. It is unknown whether VGL still exists today, and who--or what--is currently occupying it...
