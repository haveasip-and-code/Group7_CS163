happy as a goldfish in the sea
happy as a goldfish in the sea, ahh those immortal words, bring a tear to the old eye.....well well well, i beg to disagreee, i do admit to uttering those words when i was hmmm under the influence. But nothing at all can compare to jan flashing at an eleven year old and kissing her little brothers terrrfieed friends. I rest my case. Plus theses words made a lot of sense at the time, and think about it, how happy would a goldfish be, surrounded by all that water, like a kid in a candy shop!!
