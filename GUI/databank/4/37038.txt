Mac
Formerly McIntosh, also known as 'Apple,' the company has shortened their name to Mac. Mac is a computer operating system that runs on [UNIX] code, a system developed in 1969 at AT&T Bell Laboratories which can support multitasking in a multiuser environment. Mac is a powerful system, highly capable of multitasking, which is competitor Microsoft's biggest weakness in their operating system, Windows. Unfortunately, any car enthusiast would know that 'it's more about who's driving, than what's under the hood.' Even with all of Mac's power, their severe lack of compatibility and difficult setup make Windows by far a more popular choice by most.
