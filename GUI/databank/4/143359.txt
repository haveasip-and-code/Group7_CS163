Strange Days
Follow up album to the Doors' ground breaking debut. Released in October 1967, this album enjoyed success similar to its predecessor (peaking at #3). However, its always been classified as a step down from the group's first album. Mainly because the idea is that the best songs were cherry-picked for the Doors' first album and these are the left overs. ; Still on its own this album is excellent and has a ton of great Doors hits including [Love Me Two Times], [People Are Strange], [Moonlight Drive], [Strange Days] and another 11 minute epic known as [When The Music's Over]. ; Often known as the Doors' darkest release, Strange Days is very underrated. Even the 'filler' tracks are excellent namely the moody [You're Lost Little Girl]. The only thing weak here is [Horse Latitudes] a wretched poem written by [Jim Morrison]. None the less, a formidable follow up.
