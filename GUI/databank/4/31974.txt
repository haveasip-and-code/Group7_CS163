fanguide
A spinoff to a show that includes the show premise, and usually multiple episode ideas divided into seasons, character sketches, and scripted episodes. This art was pioneered by Jake with 'Maggie and Jake', and has since yielded many other gems by various authors. Some of the better known fanguides are 'The Spermsons', 'City Bart', and 'The History of The Simpsons'.
