naff
British slang, today meaning uncool, tacky, unfashionable, worthless... or as a softer expletive, in places where one might use 'fuck' as in 'naff off', 'naff all', 'naffing about'. ; Origins of the word are disputed, but it appears to have come from [Polari] (gay slang), used to dismissively refer to heterosexual people. It was introduced as a less offensive expletive verb ('naff off') in the '70s UK television show, Porridge. 'Naff off!' was famously used by Princess Anne in 1982.
