Plevyak
1. To have the ability to enjoy sexual intercourse up to 4 times without skeeting all over your partner *be it man or woman in this case*. ; 2. First time love-makers who are twitching too much to allow semen to exit their body. Shaking of the body causes the sperm to get confused (not that these sperm aren't confused in the first place) and just go back in their hole. ; 3. To ask the question....'what is pre-cum'?
