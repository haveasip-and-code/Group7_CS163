Bipolar Disorder
A mental illness where the sufferer experiences episodes of depressed and manic states. During the depression periods the sufferer has feelings of worthlessness and deflation. Manic episodes are characterised by opposite thoughts, where the person can be hyperactive, talk very quickly, make rash decisions and be dominated by thoughts of sex. Often during these episodes the sufferer is unaware of what they are doing and will deny anything is wrong with them.
