Poppie
An enthusastic fan of 'Pop Will Eat Itself' (PWEI). ; often seen talking about said band, and currently explaining said band to person listening, because they may not have heard of them. (PWEI was around as early as the mid eighties, with a slew of sounds. Best described as a sampling rock band with political passion towards the end)
