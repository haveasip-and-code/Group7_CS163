roleplay
(v.) To act and speak as if you are the character you're portraying. To roleplay is as much about what not to say as what TO say. It means to keep your speech in the context of the setting in which your character (or avatar) exists. Context can be defined as both time and place. ; Most roleplaying that occurs is in an online setting, such as an online game, a chat room, or a message board. ; (adj.) A setting in which the act of roleplaying is strongly encouraged, or even enforced.
