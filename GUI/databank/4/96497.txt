Mandrax
Mandrax (pronounced '[mandrakes]' and often misspelled as such) is the name of a particular [quaalude] (or '[downer]') [tablet] that was first manufactured in Britain during the late 60s and early 70s. Its active ingredient is [Methaqualone], which is chemically and functionally related to [barbiturates]. Street names for Mandrakes include '[mandies],' '[buttons],' '[MX],' and '[white pipe].' Mandrax tablets were initially a [controlled substance] prescribed as a sleeping aid but were pulled off the market and banned because of their extremely high dependancy ([addiction]) rate. ; Though legal production of Mandrax ceased long ago, it is still illegally manufactured in many African and south Asian countries and is fighting a losing battle with [crack cocaine] on the African [drug market]. Mandrax tablets were designed to be taken orally but current trends in abuse involve grinding the tablets into powder and [snorting] them, or more commonly grinding the tablets and mixing them with [Dagga] before smoking it inside a specialized [Dagga pipe] (hence the nickname '[white pipe]'). When taken orally, Mandrax is almost always abused in conjunction with [alcohol] which serves to magnify the euphoric effects. ; [Side effects] of Mandrax are similar to those of the common [anti-depressant]--[cramps], [insomnia], [headaches], [emotional instability], and so forth, with the added effects of toxin-induced [psychosis] as well as loss of muscle control. ; The United States [Drug Enforcement Agency] ([DEA]) has classified Mandrax as a [Schedule I] drug due to the fact that it contains [Methaqualone]. [Schedule I] drugs are illegal to possess without a license in the United States because of the potential for [abuse] and/or [addiction].
