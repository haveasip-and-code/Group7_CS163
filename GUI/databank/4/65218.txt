Fox Force Five
'Fox as we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force as we're a force to be reckoned with. Five as there's one ... two ... three ... four ... five of us.' The Fox Force Five is a group of assassins, each with their own specialty. It first appeared in a dialogue in the movie Pulp Fiction. One can use this as a term of respect, irony or insult.
