RPG Lite
A special variety of console games marketed as Role Playing games. Contains scripted undeviatable gameplay, tons of fighting, leveling up, buying weapons, and no actual role playing. In otherwords, a 30 minute anime episode stretched into a 40+ hour romp because it makes you fight battles and sit through cutscenes every 10-15 seconds.
