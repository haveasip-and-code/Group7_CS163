warrentucky
An area of Warren, Michigan that is filled with run-down starter homes, and which has a very large white trash population. It gained its name for having a high number of people who look like they're from rural Kentucky (ie. pickup trucks on the lawn, etc.). It's somewhere near Groesbeck and 10 Mile, I think. ; All of Warren is not Warrentucky, but there is a certain amount of spillover into other parts of the city. It is not uncommon to see rusty Chevy Berettas filled with skanky Warrentucky chicks driving around. For these vehicles, an [Insane Clown Posse] sticker is almost mandatory.
