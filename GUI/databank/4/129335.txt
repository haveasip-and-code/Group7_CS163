Mick Jones
The guitarist for the legendary punk band,The Clash. ; Born on June 26th,1955 as Michael Geoffery Jones. His mom was Jewish. I don't know if he is. Mick got booted out of The Clash,because of his and Joe's unability to get along,yeah,something like that. Mick kinda did coccaine a bit,and he was a stubborn bastard. He also was anti-violence. YAY MICK JONES RULES!!!!!
