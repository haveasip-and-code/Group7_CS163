Liquid Generation
A site that one time prided itself with always being current, having great animation, being absolutely hillarious, and pushing the envelope. Had memorable skits like Masterpiece Movie Reviews and even a game where you had to spot the transvestite. Memorable, indeed. ; LG has now become a shitfest, mostly since The Walrus left a couple of years ago to launch his own project, ZipperFish.com, which is nothing more than a subscription page for porn ads. Once a force to be rekoned with, you'd probably find the average E/N site funnier.
