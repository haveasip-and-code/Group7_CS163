Sociopath
The definition given is inaccurate ('For example, if someone prefers to be alone all the time rather than be among friends, family, or other people. Another could be someone who intentionally cuts their wrist everytime they feel they did 'something wrong'') ; Self-injury has nothing to do with being a sociopath. I find this offensive and increases the stigma of a serious disorder ; Sociopath refers to a person who lacks a conscience
