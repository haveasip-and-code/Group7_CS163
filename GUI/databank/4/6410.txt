South Jersey
The part NOT influenced by those from New Yawk City. Prior to Atlantic City becoming a gambling hellhole (versus just a abandoned vacation city hellhole) South Jersey was pretty much an entire different land from Northern New Jersey. In fact there was a movement to sucede from Northern New Jersey in the late 1960's but it didn't work. Also reference Piney or Pinies.
