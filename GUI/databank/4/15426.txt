FOP
A 19th century-ish term for what is basically a [metrosexual]. A [dandy], if you will. Usually high-cultured, well-dressed, very social individual who enjoys fashion and parties and prissy things like that. Perfect personal hygiene. NOT always gay, though often so. Often cannot actually afford this expensive, high-class lifestyle but somehow tries to live it anyway.
