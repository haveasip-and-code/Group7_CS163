dick fart
noun: Penile flatulence (air or gas escaping from the penis through the urethra), a.k.a. a [quofe] (also spelled [quof] or [quoaf]). ; NOTE: Dick farts or quofes are a rare phenomenon compared to queefs because it is much harder for air to become stuck in a man's urethra than in a woman's comparatively larger vagina. Quofes occur most frequently after a [catheter] has been inserted into the penis and removed, leaving air trapped in the bladder or urethra.
