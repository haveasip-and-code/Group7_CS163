The Misfits
A small --very small-- group of people... Often considered like this: -crosses two fingers-. Pretty much the loner, social outcasts of the online world... ( Whether want it that way or not. ><;) The leader of the group is often found wearing that. -points to Le Capitan hat- Though, most of the people in this group are known for objects such as: The Faulty Shotgun, HAGs, Ninetails, MLP, the Love Van, the 23 Quadrilad, Chicken Bukaw, ET, Ayools, and...other...stuff. If you would want to find them, for some undisclosed reason... Your best bet would probably be in a tree... Or an inn. A Rhy'Din inn. Oh, the horror of rhyming.
