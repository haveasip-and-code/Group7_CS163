geocache
Destination point, usually a container with small objects and/or toys, for a [GPS] based orienteering sport/hobby called 'Geocaching' after the web site of the same name. Participants hide containers (or sometimes objects, clues, or virtual objects) and publish GPS coordinates and hints on the Gecaching web site. Others seek the geocache as a form of recreation and may exchange items for those in the geocache, as well as reporting (online) the success or failure of their search.
