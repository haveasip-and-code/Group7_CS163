Mammoth MK. II
Number two on the list on the most powerful units in Tiberian Sun. ; It is a giant walking mech that has two railguns and long range/anti air missiles called Mammoth Tusks. It can totally wreak havoc on a Nod base. It can destroy a cyborg commando while taking down the base defenses at the same time. A very valuable asset to a GDI commander's base.
