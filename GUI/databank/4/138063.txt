pixelante
Originally, a term coined by Jack Thompson, referring to members of the internet-based gaming subculture who have taken it upon themselves to take action against him for his harassment of Mike Krahulik, the artist from the webcomic Penny Arcade. ; The term has since been reclaimed by two designers at Straight Loop, who have made a tshirt design based on the word.
