Targeternative
Alternative music that can be found in stores that are not primarily known for selling music. This is considered to be a sign that the band is no longer alternative; when you can find your favorite band's records in the 'Breakout Artists' section of Target, it is assumed that they have gone mainstream. (From root words 'Target' and 'alternative'.)
