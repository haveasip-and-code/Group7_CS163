wooly
A wooly is short for the Liverpool term Wooly Back which is a derogatory expression for people from lancashire and cheshire, originating from the early 1900's when the population of lancashire used to wear a form of sheepskin coat and was considered to be a sheep shagger by scousers. ; This of course has not changed much, except the lancashire and cheshire fashion sense has got worse
