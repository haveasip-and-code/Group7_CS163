nibelheim
A fictional town from the video game [Final Fantasy VII]. It was the hometown of [Cloud Strife] and [Tifa] Lockheart until it was destroyed by [Sephiroth]. The town was later rebuilt by the [Shinra] corporation in a cover-up operation and actors were hired to replace the townspeople. ; The name 'Nibelheim' is probably a mistranslation of 'Niflheim' - The realm of the dead in Norse mythology.
