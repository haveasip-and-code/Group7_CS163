canks
Abbreviation of [cankles]. ; An ebonics phrase used by black folk (or people who believe that they too, are black)to describe the fatty build up around the lower area of their legs. You see, little one, the morbidly obese have no differentiation between their calves and ankles, therefore 'CANKLES' or CANKS for short.
