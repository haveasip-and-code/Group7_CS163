Phammo
A nickname originally made for a particular Asian kid. A big deal was made for coming up with the nickname. Eventually Phammo came out and it was good. Now the one known as the original Phammo lives in Florida, USA. His entity is protected by a abstract field miles in radius. His [forcel] from his [mewclaw] is dangerously volatile and will implode if harm is done to him.
