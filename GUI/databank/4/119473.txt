regul00bie
The complete opposite of a forum n00bie, but equally annoying. ; They guard their internet community as if it were a real country and hate anyone new. ; They've somehow convinced themselves that post count and star rating are somehow directly correlated to intellect. ; Someone with 10 000 posts and a 5 star rating = Super Genius. ; Someone with 4 posts and 1 star = Dumbass. ; They will defend anyone else with a high post count (Their E-friend) and persecute anyone who steps up to their sacred forum.
