Mathematics
There is certainty. ; Mathematics gives us the power of perception. ; Though the physical applications of mathematics may change, the thoughts themselves are eternal and are in another realm of existence. ; Mathematics is thought and, therefore, it is eternal and can be known by anyone. ; [Today we view mathematical ideas as free creations of the human mind. ; They are the tools we use to map the world. ; Experience is the key. ; Although absolute certainty is not possible, we can still attain accurate knowledge and reasonable beliefs about the world and universe we live in through the notions of mathematics.]
