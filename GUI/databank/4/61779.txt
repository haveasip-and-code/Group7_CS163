Nu metal
The new wave of musicians who grew up listening to 70's and 80's metal. The new metal bands have thir roots in old metal but use other techniques to produce a new sound. for example many nu metal bands use sampling, rap-like lyrics,low pitch, the list goes on and its diffrent for each nu metal band. ; Nu metal had sucess in the late 90's (even thought it existed as early as 1991) but now people have turned on nu metal and it has fallen out of favor. ; Many fans of the old metal cant accept the evolution of their genre. People also dont like nu metal because it was used as just another fad and once a fad is over everyone hates it. ; But nu metal lives on. Thier are only th loyalest fans left and we wont stop listening to what we like to listen to because you dont like it.
