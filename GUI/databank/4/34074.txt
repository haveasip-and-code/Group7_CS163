Brother Dan
My crazy new brother who sits next to me in Graphic Design. There used to be another Dan there, but he turned into a kid named Josh. Therefore, I told Josh that his new name is Dan and he said he could be my brother. Alex is my father in-law because I married his daughter and we have a son named Billy.
