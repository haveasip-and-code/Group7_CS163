AShole
Someone with [Asperger's Syndrome] who is exhibiting social (more typical) or mental (rarer) impairment characteristic of said syndrome. Pronounced either as 'ah-sohl' or, if you need to be sure you're perceived as delivering the proper term (or if you're southern), 'aye-ess-hole.' ; It may be noted that despite the similarity between the term '[asshole]' and 'AShole,' AShole is only partially an insult; it is also a partial pardoning of whatever the [aspie] did to be described by this term.
