bipolar
Severe form of mental illness. To call it a mood swing is a understatement. It more like PMS on crack. [Bipolar] highs are characterized by delusions of grandure(thinking you can do more than you are capbable of). Lows are extreme anger or sadness. ; Believe me. I live with some with the illness.
