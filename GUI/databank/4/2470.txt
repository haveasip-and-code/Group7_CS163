spaghetti junction
The other post is correct in saying that I-35W is part of Spaghetti Junction. However, the I-35W/MN 62 junction is a whole different interchange, the [Crosstown Commons]. Spaghetti Junction is the interchange of I-35W and I-94 in downtown Minneapolis. MN 55 is also a part of the SJ, but to a lesser extent. The reason for the name is from all the local streets passing over the interchange that allow access into the interchange for the freeways. ; And although this one is not referred to as such, the I-94/I-35E interchange in downtown St. Paul (less than 10 miles to the east) can also be referred to as Spaghetti Junction due to the on-ramps from Wacouta/10th Sts into the I-94/35E interchange.
