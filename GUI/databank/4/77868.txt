Sooo Gid
Sooo gid, as in really gid, as in sooo gid, It's a metaphor, if you dont think its sooo gid then sooo gid can't really be sooo gid can it?? ; If something is 'soooo' good that you need to say so much longer than normal ; If something is so shite that you need to take the piss out of it and laugh a lot and go 'that was soo gid'
