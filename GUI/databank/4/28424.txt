Idiot Tax
A voluntary tax that is quite popular, usually used for education. The Idiot Tax may be paid in $1, $2, $5 or $10 increments but combinations are possible. The greater the idiot one is, the greater the tax one pays. Idiot Tax receipts can be scratch-off or have a combination of numbers. Also known as the lottery.
