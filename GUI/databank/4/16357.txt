A Jeph is a Filipino that holds a Pinoy clan on Xbox Live and is the ultimate best at everything CounterStrike. Good at CounterStrike, but very bad sense of humour, culture taste, and cannot hook up with girls if his life depended on it. A Jeph seems to attract many homosexual males to him when he is at a bus stop. Everyone in PinoyXBL questions a Jeph's sexuality. He is also a hacker and a camper. Pinoys don't like campers, right, Mark?
