south korea
Lots of pretty girls. Unfortunately, the smell of kimchi (macerated cabbage with garlic they eat at all meals) kind of kills the glamour. ; Koreans are in love with their cell phones. They always have it in their hand, and spend an insane amount of money on the thing. Freud would have a lot to say about that. ; Really loathe Japan, and can get vociferous on the subject. On the other hand, Japan was an absolute asshole to them, so you can't really blame the Koreans for hating their guts. ; Should be more grateful to the US for their military presence, because they have some scary neighbors, called the North Koreans. South Koreans can be surprisingly naive on the subject. Try avoiding any conversation on the subject, you generally end up banging your head on the wall (and no, I'm not American). ; Produce some of the corniest movies and soap operas ever made. 'Winter Sonata' or 'The Coastguard' come to mind. ; Korean drivers are scary, especially in Seoul. The bus drivers and taxis are lethal.
