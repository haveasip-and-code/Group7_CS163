the 'group'
A group of teens from Winnebago, or the surrounding area. The group consists of Yaya, Nick S., Nick V., John, Matt, Ryry, Poochie, Ryan S., Smithers, and many others. There is a large female population as well, though the females of the group usually depend on who a certain male member of the group is going out with at that time. ; At school the group can be found standing at the wall near the pop machines, or by Yaya's locker. Outside of school the group can be found at the park, or the mall, because they are mall rats. ; There are many clicks within the larger group.
