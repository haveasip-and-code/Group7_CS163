Well of Souls
A MIX (multiplayer) compatible game engine for Windows operating systems, coded in C and C variants by Dan Samuel and found at www.synthetic-reality.com. Its primary feature is its customization ability; players can actually create their own games to play on the Well of Souls engine. These are known as 'worlds'. ; However, most will find that, although at first the ability to build your own game is nice, the limitations of the engine make it useless for any attempt at a serious game. The incessant clicking required in order to accomplish the universal goal of attaining level 100 is, at best, utterly boring. Coupled with an unstable 'hack detection' code that locks players out of the game for running, among other things, simple WinAMP plugins, the game quickly becomes unsatisfying and dull. Add to that the fact that you must donate $20 USD in order to unlock the only truly useful features in the game, and you have something which goes beyond 'worthless'.
