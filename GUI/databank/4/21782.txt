DAK
stands for Disney's Animal Kingdom. ; Apparently it's 'nahtazu,' which you assume to be some swahili word, but it's a lame thing that Disney invented to prove that DAK is 'not a zoo.' ; Check out the Festival of the Lion King, Primeval Whirl, and Dinosaur. Kali River Rapids is cool too. ; An indoor rollercoaster is being built, Expedition Everest. Will prolly be pretty sweet. Prolly Disney's call to Universal's new Mummy ride.
