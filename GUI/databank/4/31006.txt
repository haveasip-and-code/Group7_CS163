parsippany
Parsippany or P-town is a municipality in Morris County, one of the wealthiest counties in the US. Contrary to public opinion, it is not the ghetto of Morris County as many claim it is; that would be Dover. I grew up and went to school here and I can say with confidence that my teachers have taught and prepared me well for college and life. My alma mater (PHHS) might not have had the highest average SAT scores but it did have dedicated teachers who never ceased to challenge me and who have helped mold me into the person I am today. And o yea, PHHS Acadec team owns.
