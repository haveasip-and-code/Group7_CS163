loft
What used to be termed as a 'Studio Apartment' (+/- 400 SF) is now being marketed as 'loft' by real estate people to capitalize on current trends and confuse the buying public that any one room apartment is a 'loft'. ; (A REAL loft is a minimum of 1,000+ sf with no walls, but could be divided up into several rooms if so desired.)
