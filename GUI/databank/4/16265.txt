monks walk
During the winter months, the small pathway in Surrey referred to as Monks Walk becomes a holy grail for Thorpe Park Fanboys. They flock to it in their dozens, hoping to get a glimpse of the precious rides, and perhaps construction of new ones. ; Many have been known to try jumping the fence, only to start crying when they realise that there is barbed wire, and when they get back to school having bunked off they'll have to explain the cuts.
