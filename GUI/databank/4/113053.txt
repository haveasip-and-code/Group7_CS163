snetmonch
Snetmonch is an ancient American god of rats. It is said that the 'Lost Colony' that just disapeared was a result of this mysterious god of wounder. He was said to be sited at Mount Olympus with Zues and the god of Love. He is not a well know god because he likes to be hidden and discrete, many people try to recreate his works. His power is summoning armies of rats, and it is said that to this day Snetmonch lives in the sewers of New York City and uses Rats to steal for him.
