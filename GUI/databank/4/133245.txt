verse chorus verse
The most common song structure, comprising of the main verse then the chorus followed by the verse again. ; This song structure is by far the most common and can be described by one word brainwashing. ; A bridge can be used to flow the verse into the chorus and vice versa. ; As a side note if any of you knew anything about Nirvana you guys would know Kurt Cobain had an affinity for changing the name of his songs and band, which you would know by reading any biography of the band. So I am sure that the song was probably reffered to as verse chorus verse, and sappy. Since Verse Chorus Verse songs are very sappy. Just like that song. Also being a musician myself I know that bands often 'nickname' songs and use different names often made up by the singer to lable the song when used for publlic. EX: My band has a song we call 'The surf Song' But the name of the song is Mogow.
