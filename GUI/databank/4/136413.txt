Hmongcanic
One who seems to take care of their car by doing the bare minimum to maintain mechanical driveability and cosmetic appearance. Doing 'hack jobs' on anything wrong on the car to make it suffice, Often distinguished by black steelies and exhausts held up by rope, large amounts of unsanded bondo material, and cut springs. Failing to spend money on real performance car parts and trying to make their own, failing miserably.
