leeco
well... for a while i just kept sayin 'Im Leet baby... LEET!' and then this Spanish guy said 'Loco' so i started sayin 'im Loco baby... LOCO!' and then i didnt know which one of the two to say, so i merged them into a whole new word. Now i thought the holy grail of slang bs words (urban dictionary) would have already discovered it, but when i checked i scored... so therefore this word is mine baby... MINE!
