catherine tate
A woman comedian for whom no allowances need to be made. A brilliant observer of social types in modern Britain...she drills into the kind of people you normally skirt around and taps the wellspring of their irritating nature. Rarely has an apprenticeship with the Royal Shakespeare Company been put to such good use. The nation should immortalize her in Cockney rhyming slang.
