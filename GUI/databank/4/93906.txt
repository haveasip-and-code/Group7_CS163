Hollarator
An electronic inter-personal communication device that serves as a vector for both voice and text based communications. Modern day hollarators are hand-held, and communications are transmitted via wireless digital information networks. Early hollarators transmitted communications between two cans via a string. However, advancements made during the technological revolution of the late 80's and 90's allowed for the creation of a more portable, wireless hollerator that provides the user with more consistency and clearer reception. ; accepted alternative spellings include: hollerator. ; see also: cell phone
