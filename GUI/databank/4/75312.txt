Eznesticism
Noun: (Ezz-nest-y-ciz-m) ; A complicated game that can be randomly started at any one time by any one person resulting in a furious battle of looking [stupid]. The aim of the game is to stand behind the most competing people for as long as possible. This can turn brutal as there are no rules primarily because I cannot be [arsed] to think of any.
