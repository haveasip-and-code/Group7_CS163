dead or alive
A very enjoyable fighting game series with a simple, fast but deep fighting engine, very easy to get into. Although many shallow minded people will just say its bad and its all about sex appeal, which i think is wrong. For exanple there are more male fighters than female and no one complained when mai had bounce factor in 95. also there was a sub par volleyball spin-off.
