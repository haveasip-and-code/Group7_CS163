Caraquista
A proud and loyal fan of the 'Leones del Caracas' the best baseball team venezuela has ever had. Although sometimes defined as cocky, petulant and brashly self-confident, a Caraquista is just a person who (no matter what) thinks his/her team is the best in the universe; in fact, the Leones are the venezuelan equal of the New York Yankees. Enough said!
