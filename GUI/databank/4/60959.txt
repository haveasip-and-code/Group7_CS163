philosopher
The academic equivalent of a guru. ; A guru scams you by feeding you metaphysical horse crap and all he wants in exchange is for you to give up all of your worldy possessions and follow him but since you'll be giving up all of your worldy possessions,why not sell them and give the proceeds to the guru? ; Whereas a philosopher is pretty much in the exact same business except the scam is to sell books.
