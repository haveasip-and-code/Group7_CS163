nellie huckins
A little camp on the shores of Lake Osipee, a place where girls stand on benches and sing at the top of their lungs. Spend nights on the island, jump off a pontoon boat, learn how to shoot an arrow, get down and dirty, and most importantly make the best friends a girl could have. Us Nellie girls will never forget-- the midnight thunderstorms, the barnyards, being a huckster, the feel of sand in your bed, a bugle blowing to wake you, college day, finally being the older girl, your first night, capers, candlelight ceremony. And no one will ever forget the bittersweet feeling of pulling away from 17 Camp Huckins Road, tears rolling down your cheeks, because you know there is still eleven and a half months until you see your best friends again.
