Jar Jar Death
A way of dying reserved for the only most irritating, annoying, pointless and infuriating of creatures. ; The more annoying the person, the more terrible the death - a form of compensation, if you like. ; And so, of course, [Jar Jar Binks] is the namesake here - he alone deserves to die more horribly, more slowly and painfully than anyone else.
