hellcon
Hellcon is the embodiment of the fictitious Anime Convention conceived by the [Fullmetal Alchemist] fandom on LiveJournal know as '[hell-con].' ; While the later is a fictional convention, Hellcon has become an actual scheduled event. Hellcon is thus described as the gathering of members of a specific Fullmetal Alchemist fandom situationed on LJ. ; Clad in crackishly-bright yellow t-shirts with the flamel logo a patented (not really but let's pretend) Hellcon slogan, a Hellcon at your con will be hard to miss. ; Officially sanctioned by voice actor Vic Mignogna (who is also the acting 'host') and with such guests as 'God', 'Travy', 'Kevykins,' 'Farfignoogen', and more, Hellcon has a strong foundation and will be a mainstain at conventions across the country for years to come. ; As of 2005, there are three official Hellcons scheduled. ; Hellcon Central will be held at Project [A-Kon] in Dallas. ; Hellcon East will be held at [Otakon] in Baltimore. ; Hellcon West will be held at Anime Expo in Anaheim. ; Offshoots for Hellcon are also scheduled for Anime Central in Chicago, Anime North in Toronto, Anime Boston in (get this) Boston, and several other conventions coming up in the 2006 convention season. ; So grab your bags, get your fangirl beating sticks ready, and stock up on sour patch straws and [pocky].... because we're going to Hellcon!
