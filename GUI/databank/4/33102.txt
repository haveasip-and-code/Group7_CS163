ruthless rob
Ok, Im gonna finish were the real [Ruthless] (definition one) left off. I really have seen this guy in concert and he is a [gheymo]. The highlight of his show was when [Richard Simmons] came out and gave him a [salty pirate]. He has been arrested multiple times for what he likes to call, '[whip off a batch]' while starring at little boys in preschool parking lots. The only good thing about him is his oldest daughter. She is hot, but dumber than bricks. She always lets me play [rowdy cowboy] and for that Im happy. But then there is his mom. She sufers from what Im sure you read about in definition 1, but also, she has [the zactly disease]. Really, its quite sad. She makes up for it though cause she looks good after an [angry dragon], [angry beaver], [coney island special], [glass bottom boat ride], or any combination there of! What a bitch man. Should I continue? And have you ever seen a rapper with a [kentucky waterfall]? Yeah, me either. I recommend purchasing an [AK-12] and putting this loser out of his misery cause I am personally gonna be [taking brown] if I see this jack ass eat one more [onion ring] off the [knob] of another homeless drunk.
