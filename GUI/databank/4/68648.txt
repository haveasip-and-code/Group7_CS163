Aspen Hill
The little town of Maryland (in [MoCO]) that is known for absolutely nothing. Oh, except for many of the 2002 sniper shootings being there. It's in between Wheaton, Rockville and Olney, and has the characteristics of all of those places, but mostly Wheaton. There's not a lot to do, but hey.
