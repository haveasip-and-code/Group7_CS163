[way] the end of the way (Sof HaDerech)
This phrase comes from Hebrew, and its meaning is something extraordinarily good. If we need to go through a way in order to get somewhere, the end of this way would be the place we want to get to or a condition we desire to be in -- and this place or condition is of course valuable for us. ; Hence, 'the end of the way' is something REALLY good.
