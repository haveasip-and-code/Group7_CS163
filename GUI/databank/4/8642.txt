The J.R. Effect
When a bullheaded person is ill-trained, in charge, and singlemindedly opposes a large team of intelligent dissenters, and this stubborn decision causes severe loss, that is the J.R. effect ; Usage note: The J.R. effect is often preceeded by what is known as the [chewbacca defense].
