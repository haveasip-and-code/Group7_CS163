Scrubcore
Dirty kids that live in a trailer and often wear the same clothes everyday. They listen to [MTV] bands like [Slipknot], [Linkin Park], [Korn] and [System Of A Down] and think they're [goth] or [hardcore] because they wear [hot topic] clothes. They think [Halo]/[Halo 2] is the only/best [FPS] ever because they don't know that FPS's aren't ment to be played on consoles because they either can't afford a good computer or it doesn't fit in their trailer
