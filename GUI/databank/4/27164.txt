the Bronx
The Bronx is really the only borough that hasn't been infected with that whole Giuliani-Bloomberg 'let's gentrify everything we get our hands on' disease. Although it does have Riverdale, Fieldston, and Throgs Neck, most of the rest of the Bronx is mad hood. It's a working-class place with fun, hood-ass muthafuckas who are down for whatever, but y'all better step correct because there is no tolerance for improper respect. If you disrespect, you WILL get your ass beat. Even white boys (esp. Albanians in Belmont) will set it hard.
