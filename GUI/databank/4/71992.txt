Kenny Chesney
This punk is a balding, rather fugly, [cunt tree] singer who is, for some unknown reason, loved by millions of females across America, mostly in [The South] and parts of the lower Midwest (mostly Kentucky, Missouri, and southern Illinois). He has a horrid accent, can't even sing, and is pretty dumb.
