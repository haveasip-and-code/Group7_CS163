afdn
Pronounced 'Afden', this is a necessary 'workplace friendly' acronym for the term 'ass-faced-dick-nose'. This acronym also bears punerific humour in it's similarity in sound to 'Afton', which is a region of St Louis highly populated by immigrant Bosnians, most of which have faces that look like an ass, neatly adorned with a dick-like nose. The acronym was created in response to an increasingly 'professional' work environment, in which the term 'ass-faced-dick-nose' seemed to become 'unpopular' with the higher ups.
