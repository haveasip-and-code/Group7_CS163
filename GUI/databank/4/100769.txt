SATAM
Overrated Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon. ; It was a good series, with an interesting plotline and some well thought out characters, but it was hardly anything that could be considered 'Sonic', as the only relevence the show had to the popular Sega character was Sonic himself. Nothing else related to original games or characters at all, and the fact that Tails was basically a defenceless kid who barely made any appearences was painful. ; Sonic X episode 1 > SATAM
