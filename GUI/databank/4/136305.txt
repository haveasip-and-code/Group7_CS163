Chicken Winged
To be hit by a elbow, also known as the 'chicken wing slap'. Harder to deliver, as it requires your opponent to be behind you, but more effective than a punch, since your wrist would twist slightly as your fist connected, reducing the overall force exerted. A elbow can be delivered quicker, so it hurts more, often with a quick jolt of your shoulders. ; Chicken winging somebody in front of you is not advised.
