I'll make you eat your parents
A phrase uttered by Cartman on south park a few times throughout the fifth season. Cartman, in the show, actually DID make Scott Tennerman eat his own parents. I should also mention, that that episode is by far the best episode of south park. (Scott Tennerman Must Die)
