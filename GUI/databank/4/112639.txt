apocatastasis
A restoration to the original condition. A name given to the theological belief that a time will come when all free creatures will share in the grace of salvation, even the devils and lost souls. According to this dogma, the reason hell exists is to separate good from evil in the soul. It is therefore not an eternal punishment, but an amelioration. A time will come when all evil shall cease to be, since it has no existence of its own apart from the free will.
