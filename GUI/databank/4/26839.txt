Bright Eyes
Bright Eyes is an absolutely awesome BAND (not just Conor) that manages to put so much emotion and power into every melody they make. Please, dont love them because conor is 'sexy' (hes not, hes a drug addicted depressed crybaby) but instead because conor is a genius. The lyircs in these songs are more real then anyhting i've ever heard, and i think thta calls for genius. ; Still, many call the band a sell-out, because now 50 million poser-punk emo freekas are all calling conor 'the sex' who swear they slit their wrists. instead of being angry at the band, i think real fans should just feel sorry for it. ESPECIALLY because emo kids ruined live shows. no more live shows for me :(
