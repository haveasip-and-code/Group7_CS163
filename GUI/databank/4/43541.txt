Puerto Rican
Oh, yeah! It was about damn time someone said the truth! I agree with Lobito Triste on this one folks. The Americans have a huge misconception about Puerto Ricans. They think we are like Fat Joe, or Jlo and those Newyorkricans. Puertoricans are a nice breed of people that are way more different than those ppl you see on the streets saying stuff like YO! WhAD UP DAWG? In order to understand what a puertorican is you must visit the island or meet people that actually came from the island. There's a difference between newyorkricans and Puerto Ricans (newyorkricans is how people from the island call those puerto ricans that were born and raised on the U.S. regardless of where they are) And like Lobito Triste said there are is an increasing number of Headbangers and skaters on the island. (It's rare to find that kind of puertoricans on the U.S. and I happen to be one of them thank you very much.) ; Not all of us listen to reggaeton and talk with that urban accent. We can speak both spanish and English properly. I just want to say that we are a race that we have a little bit of white, indian and black blood in our veins and that's what makes us so diverse.
