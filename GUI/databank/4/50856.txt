hatter
A male or female who supports the mighty Stockport County FC. Often confused with fans of Luton Town, who are also known as Hatters, but as Stockport were formed first (1883 to Luton's 1885) they can lay claim to being the original (although certainly not best on recent performance) hatters. Also occasionally confused with a character from Alice in Wonderland. ; Hatters are generally discontented with life due to the direct correlation between perfomance of football team and general happiness.
