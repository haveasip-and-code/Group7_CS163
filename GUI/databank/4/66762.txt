Rik Mayall
In the late 1970s, Rik and [Adrian Edmondson] formed a comedy group called 'Twentieth Century Coyote' while attending college together in Manchester. Originally a five-man team, Twentieth Century Coyote eventually became a partnership between just Rik and Ade. That partnership exists to this present day and is one of the most enduring and successful partnerships in modern British comedy. The duo appeared often on Saturday nights during open mike time at The Comedy Store. Once they had joined The Comic Strip Presents... team, Rik became part of the alternative comedians 'legend'. He continued to appear in 15 episodes of The Comic Strip Presents... and also co-wrote a number of episodes with his long-term comedy partner, Edmondson, including Mr Jolly Lives Next Door and Dirty Movie. ; From this experience with The Comic Strip Presents... he went on to co-write and star in [The Young Ones] with [Ben Elton] and [Lise Meyer]. He played Rick, the political anarchist studying Sociology (or was it Domestic Science?) who was a poetic genius, adored [Cliff Richard] and rude words. This show forever sealed his fame as a performer. It's since become a cult hit that's known all over the world. ; Since doing The Young Ones, Rik has appeared in numerous television shows and films. Some of the most famous are [Bottom], which rivals The Young Ones for its cult status; ]The New Statesman], in which Rik portrayed Tory MP Alan B'Stard with a wicked sense of satire; and the films [Drop Dead Fred] and [Guest House Paradiso].
