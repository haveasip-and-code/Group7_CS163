Djimbe
The poster known as Djimbe has been utterly proven to be a liar and a fake. The Bullshido Administration have decided to take action and notify all posters through this signature of Djimbe's past claims: ; * Tigerfly can own collegiate wrestlers ; * Telling wrestlers what is or is not a shoot when he doesn't wrestle ; * He can break Rickson's forearms at will and could beat him in a streetfight ; * TF's workout regime surpases those of pro athletes ; * All Judo/BJJ comes from Qin-na ; * He claimed he had an upcoming MMA fight ; * He thinks he could take Matt Thorton ; * He thinks he's more skilled than Asia (no one has seen that at any throwdowns). The implication at the time was fighting, not just Baji. ; * Grappling and beating two BJJers at once ; * People must ask his instructor permission before opening up a school in Chinatown. ; * 'its really not all that hard to pick up (ground grappling) if your Chinese Standing Grappling game was tight in the first place' -he has no clue as to what grappling is. ; * Three months at his XingYi place and TF could destroy a bjj blue belt in grappling. ; Also please, when responding to a djimbe post, use The Djimbe Translator
