pale
The best fucking skin color for white/asians in the world, makes a lot of girls a lot more attractive than they normally would be when they have it, providing they're mildly attractive in the first place. Can also make girls look worse, but the good outweighs the bad. ; In Hong Kong, China, it's looked upon as a status symbol to have milky white skin, sometimes in Japan too. Women buy skin whiteners to have their skin whiter, and go to lengths to have white skin. It's like the opposite of the USA. ; In the USA, it's looked down upon for whatever reason, probably the influence of pop culture. A scrawny tanned boy is seen as innocent, where a scrawny pale boy is looked down upon heavily in the USA by some people. ; Pale skin was also looked upon as beautiful by early cultures, like in the 16th century, and in early Roman cultures. ; I have seen pale Mexicans, Asians, and Whites. Black women can't get pale, but they look beautiful with their natural colors anyway. ; If Sir Mix-A-Lot could make a statement saying how he liked big butts, then people can certainly make a statement about their pale skin, to make it less looked down upon for both males and females. We need less tan lines. ; If you are someone who makes fun of it, then stop being so ridiculous because you already have a buffet of people that fit your choices anyway. If you have pale skin yourself, then don't change it and stick up for yourself at all costs. It's something to be proud of. ; Get with it, pale skin is in.
