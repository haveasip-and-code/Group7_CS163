Joey Hater
A Detroit [Lions] fan who has been driven at least partially insane from watching too much bad football and, thus, is obsessed with the notion that [Joey Harrington] is a terrible quarterback and the primary stimulus for the team's futility. ; True Joey Haters often have unresolved [anger issues] and are often overheard saying things like, 'Joey sucks' or 'Joey is the worst quarterback in the NFL' or 'Joey is a noodle-arm.' Although sometimes, while sleeping, they may be heard muttering, 'I love you, Joey' or 'Joey is hot.' ; A Joey Hater feels that it is very important to take a stand against Joey. They feel this inner-conviction of theirs will help the Lions be a better team. ; A True Joey Hater's favorite passtime is arguing with his positive [doppelganger] or antithesis, the [Joey Lover]. During these exchanges all aspects of Joey's [game] are likely to be covered. The Joey Hater will usually, although not always, be the first to resort to personal attacks which contain [homophobic] slurs.
