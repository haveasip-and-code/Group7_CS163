Phrase to yell out when somebody has done something so awesome that a one handed high five is almost an insult, therefore you exert them to a double slap. If a person yells this and does not receive the requested action they are currently the biggest loser in the general area. ; note:not a fake def. just may have not have caught on in your area, i suggest you use it as soon as possible!
