Amazon Trail
Fun children's computer game in which the player attempts to navigate from the base of the Amazon River to a lost Incan city in Peru. Occasionally, Amazon Trail was put onto elementary school computers. However, [Oregon Trail] (another good game) was more prominent in schools, and therefore remains more famous today.
