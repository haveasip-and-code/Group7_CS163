Rocko's Modern Life
Definately the best cartoon Nickelodeon has ever done. It lasted 4 seasons and only 52 episodes. If you didn't like this show you were eather to young to understand the humor(propaly from 1-8) or too old to actually consider changing the channel to nick. Now all Nickelodeon shows is 50 episodes of SpongeBob(a show that definately isn't one of Nick's absolute best, definately better than Rocket Power and the Wild Thornberrys) and 20 episodes of Fairly Oddparents (Not funny or entertaining show) ; Anyway, Rocko rocks this world.
