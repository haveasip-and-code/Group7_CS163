roy jones jr.
the greatest boxer of this modern-day generation. yeah tarver beat him. he beat tarver the first time. tarver will never be able to accomplish what roy did (4 belts in 4 different divisions). the division jumping cost him at his age (35) and he lost a fight or two he shouldn't have, but he'll be back with a vengeance because he is Sugar Ray Robinson reborn.
