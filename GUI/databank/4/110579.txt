Joseph Smith
The best con man that ever lived. Created his own religion based on ideas he borrowed (stole) from an unpublished novel and the mason sect. Established a devoted flock of religious followers while remarkably continuing his snake oil ways until the day he was killed. The man is now a saint and founder of the Mormon church.
