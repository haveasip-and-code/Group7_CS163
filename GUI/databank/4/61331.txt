butt grease
Residual grease found in ones butt crack. It may stem simply from sweat or sex liquid having oozed back there (or maybe sex actually having taken place there with the aid of KY warming liquid or baby oil). The person with the malady may feel an odd slippery sensation when they walk, shift in their set, or sit down.
