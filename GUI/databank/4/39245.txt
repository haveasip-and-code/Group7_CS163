wiener kid
People involved in academic pursuits, espceically invovled in Honors programs, who think they are all very smart and cool, but really they are nothing more than a bunch of chodes. These wiener kids tend to be overenthusiastic about lame events and tend to whine a lot about classes. ; Can also be used to insult kids who ask stupid questions during class.
