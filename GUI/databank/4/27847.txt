orgasmatron
The orgasmatron is a remote operated spinal implant that will stimulate a woman to the brink of orgasm with the push of a button. Clinical trial(s) began in 2003 with the approval of the FDA. Notwithstanding spirited media coverage, enthusiasm for the procedure has been [remarkably] low. The surgeon who patented this treatment for 'sexual dysfunction' [thank you Dr. Stuart Meloy] is actually struggling to find volunteers for the trial [presently the operation is only available for women]. The anticipated cost of surgery is somewhere between $13-17,000.
