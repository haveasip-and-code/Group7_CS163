Louie The Cowman
1. A man who lives in Burlington, Vermont. He has his own live TV show where he sits in a rocking chair by a table where he takes random calls. His show uses a bad green-screen to show cows walking around in the background. Every so often a cow takes a shit. ; 2. Quite possibly the best show that I have ever seen. ; 3. A TV show on VCAM
