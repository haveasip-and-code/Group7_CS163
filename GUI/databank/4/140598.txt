caesar
im amazed this isnt already on here...urban, u dont know bk at all. anyways..a caesar is the most common haircut in the streets. you can get a fade or a caesar, and come on fellas, this isnt the 80's. a caesar for all u ignant people is a black barbers buzz cut...not any super cut piece of shit. head to [flatbush] and get urself a real cut, a caesar, get some alchohol when ur done, 10 bills, no problem. be sure to check out the bootleg jerseys the guy brings in a garbage bad while ur getting that fresh cut
