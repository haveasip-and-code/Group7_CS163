frappufuckyou
A drink consumed in certain elitist circles (squares maybe? circles have too many points. pretty inclusive I'd say) consisting of around 3 or 4 shots of vodka and a Starbucks Frappuccino. The drink is believed to have originated in Southeastern Michigan, pioneered by two members of Metro-Detroit's 'West' scene.
