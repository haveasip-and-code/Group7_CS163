Columbine
1. A beautiful flower. Also the state flower of Colorado (even before the incident) ; 2. One of the most tragic of attacks the nation has ever seen. On 20 April 1999 Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris entered their high school in Littleton, Colorado and murdered 13 people - 12 students and a teacher, before taking their own lives. Blame whomever you want, but they were the ones to pull the triggers and set up the bombs. Sadly, few really learned the lesson outside of Littleton.
