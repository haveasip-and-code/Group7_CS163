cheeky ned
n. A particular breed of [ned] or [chav] who, instead of being plain aggressive and threatening, is full of bravado and chooses instead to shout witticisms at passers-by. Favourites include: ; 'show's yer fanny!' ('could I please see your vagina?') ; 'gie's a gobble!' ('would you please perform oral sex on me?') ; 'we arra peepell!' (chanted throughout Glasgow housing estates whenever Rangers win the league - 'we are the people?' God knows what it means) ; Cheeky neds are more very curious, constantly asking you what you are doing or looking at and wondering if you'd care to duel.
