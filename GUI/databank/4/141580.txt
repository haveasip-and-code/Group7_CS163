crack baby
A completely fictional creature invented in the 1980's by the [Church of Voodoo Pharmacology]. The allegation was that crack cocaine smoked by pregnant women essentially caused [fetal alcohol syndrome], when in fact (as many doctors have testified), the often-freakish babies born to [crack] addicts were the victims of serious malnutrition (as their mothers were often very poor and/or [retarded]) and of course [fetal alcohol syndrome].
