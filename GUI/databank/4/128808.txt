roach motel
A used car dealership catering to people with bad credit. It most likely sells rattletrap older cars at inflated prices and charges exhorbitant interest rates. Buyers generally have to pay weekly or bi-weekly, as opposed to the monthly payments characteristic of legitimate lenders, and being even a few days late on a payment will trigger aggressive collections attempts and, quite possibly, repossession.
