appling
The sexual practice of inserting apples into one's rectum or vaginal cavity. In some cultures, the practice is done as a way of measuring one's sexual value. i.e., the more apples that fit into one's body cavity, the more desireable he/she is to sexual partners. Besides the number of apples, the size and quality of the apples used determines whether the person will be considered desirable in bed or not.
