pseudo disco
A musical genre refering to many newer 'indie' bands who play catchy, danceable songs. The tunes usually have a very basic 'disco' beat consisting mostly of snare and hi-hat patterns. The guitar is usually very brisk sounding and slightly overdriven, consisting primarily of barre chords. The basslines are typical disco-esque and driving. What makes these bands psuedo disco is that they're several decades late and claim to be 'rock' or 'indie'.
