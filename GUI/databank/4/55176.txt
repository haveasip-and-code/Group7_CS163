Cold War
The Cold War was a secret conspiracy between the presidents of the USA and USSR, whereby both countries would spend billions of dollars on military and defense and make it look like they considered each other a threat, when their true worry was that Earth would be invaded by aliens, after occurrences such as the [Roswell] incident.
