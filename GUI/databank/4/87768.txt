sXe
'Straight Edge' ; Another word associated with self-proclaimed trendy 'scene' kids who feel as if they're doing the world a favor by choosing to rub their lifestyle in everybody's faces. The 'x' has absolutely no relative or necessary meaning to the term, but apparently it does. Fucking idiots.
