absurdist
An adjective describing a form of theatre that makes absolutely no sense what so ever. It involves plays with near impossible scenerios, characters and bizarre dialogue that is meant to make the audience ask, 'What the hell?' Absurdist plays usually have anti-climactic endings and underlying, symbolic meanings that no one gets except the author.
