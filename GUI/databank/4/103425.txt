ak-74
A Russian assault rifle, designed by Kalishnakov, in response to the NATO 5.56x45mm round. Instead of the AK-47's 7.62x39mm round, it uses a bottle-necked 5.45x39mm round. It has many variations like the AK-47, including the ultra-short AK-74SU, developed for Russian special forces and tank crews.
