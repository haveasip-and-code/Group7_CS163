Mac user
Person who uses an Apple Macintosh computer (called [mac]s for short). Typically characterized as being significantly far less suicidal / homicidal and in a significantly more pleasant and satisfied state of mind than a windoze user because his box doesn't crash every four minutes and because macs happen to be immune to virsuses and actually, you know, work.
