base
A substance made up of about 60% amphetamine. ; In contrast to [speed], which is made up of about 5% amphetamine. ; Often methamphetamine is defined as base: 'a purer form of speed'. ; Methamphetamine is a completely different chemical, with different effects. Base is the same chemical as speed, just in much higher concentrations. ; Usually has a different effect to speed, as the higher dosage doesn't just mean fuller effects, but whole new ones as well. ; NB: both amphetamine and methamphetamine have absolutely NOTHING to do with 2,3 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), despite the uneducated and ill-informed ramblings of the DEA.
