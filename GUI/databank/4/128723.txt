Rally Crede
Chicago White Sox fans answer to rally monkeys, rally towels, and any other rally garbage invented to cheer on a team. The Rally Crede is so good that when God makes love, he calls out Oh Rally Crede! Rally Crede knows how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop. Rally Crede turns wine into beer and serves it cold to Sox fans.
