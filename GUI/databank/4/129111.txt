South Park Republican
A term used to decribe young voters who supports many conservative and libertarian values. They believe in some Republican issues such as tax reform and opposition of hate crime legislation but have libertarian views such as free speech. Mainstream conservatives criticize South Park as being profane and crude, but the show mocks liberal issues and communicates with the Republican issues. South Park Republicans tend to be less religious than the traditional Republicans; they are more likely to share the same values with more moderate politican Arnold Schwarzenegger.
