Doni
Short for 'What are you doing now?' ; BACKROUND INFORMATION: ; Doni was a mistake made in an AIM conversation. Instead of asking 'What are you doing?', the person decided to shorted it to 'Doin?'. But, they happened to make a mistake and type 'Doni?'. From that point forward they coined the phrase 'Doni?', not ony becasue they were otaku and it sounded japanese, but just because it sounded cool.
