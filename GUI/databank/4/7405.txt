Thurles
Town located in central County Tipperary. Population of 8000. No tourist atractions or anything of remote interest save Semple Stadium. A Mecca for Knackers (who we call La La's when their around). A good place to get a beating on a Friday/Saturday night. A town of great, friendly people (except for the Knackers/Plastic Knackers who cause 99% of fights along with participating in 99% of thieving).
