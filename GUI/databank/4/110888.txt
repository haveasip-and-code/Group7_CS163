buckle down
A slogan meant to convey 'Get to work!' or to say 'Quit [lollygagging] and get back to work!. ; For example: Last week the section Boss walked through the office and caught one person surfing the net at their workstation instead of working and he therefore jumped to the conclusion that all the office workers must be doing it all the time. Ergo he gave a threat to the team boss's and then doled out the 'Buckle down!' speech, which in turn was reiterated upon the employees.
