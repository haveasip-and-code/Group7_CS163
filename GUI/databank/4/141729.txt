american eagle outfitters
A place to get comfortable jeans. ; Their shirts are ugly, unoriginal ; and a cheaper way of advertisement ; for the company. They have some cool ; accessories. A little more creative than ; hollister and abecrombie and fitch. ; But, only creative if you make it that ; way. Most who shop there are just out ; to get a logo. They walk in to buy a polo ; and track pants that MUST say american eagle ; across the butt. These days originality is ; gone, which is a shame because being original ; is respected and any educated person would know ; that.
