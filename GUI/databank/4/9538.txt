amrit
Amrit is a word from Sanskrit meaning 'without death' or 'immortal'. It is not just a term 'in the Sikh religion' but has meaning outside of that context as well. In Hindu mythology, it is the name for a nectar which bestows immortality. ; In certain parts of New Delhi the word is gaining use as a label for men who are particularly well-endowed.
