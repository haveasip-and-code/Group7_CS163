Argument
Verbal disagreement between 2+ parties. An argument contains repeated presentations of conflicting views/opinions, along with added facts and logic to support the original statements. ; Some [argue] that there can, theoretically, be an argument consisting of one person (some kind of internal conflict), but pah!, this is just a mulling process- a natural part of making any decision.
