butt-ugly
A perjorative term for someone so ugly, so exceedingly unattractive. that he or she is as 'ugly as a butt' (a misnomer, since many buttocks are beautiful indeed). A popular teen-age slang term since the 80s, 'butt-ugly' most probably began as military slang c. World War II. Probably because enlisted men found nothing attractive about another enlisted man's hairy, sweaty, very possibly pimpled butt!
