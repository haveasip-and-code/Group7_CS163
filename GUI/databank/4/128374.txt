the field
An open area surrounded by houses in the street block consisting of Tim Clark Circle and Munnisunk in Simsbury, CT. This area can be used for flag football games and other outdoor activities, but it is primarily used by a select group of college students during the summer vacation to get inebriated by means of consumption of large amounts of alcohol and marijuana. It is during this activity that it can also be used for campfires, star gazing, and fornication. This area's popularity's stems from its difficulty of access by law enforcement in its attempts to break up drug and underage alcohol consumption.
