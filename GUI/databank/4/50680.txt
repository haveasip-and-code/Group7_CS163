juicy couture
juicy couture just started becoming popular in the last one or two years, and the reason it has is because the 'popular' girls saw some girl wearing it who might not be popular, but not like a geek (like me social nice and friendly but not populair) and were like o look at that girl she has a J hanging of of her hoddy and her name starts with a C thats stupid until like 4 months later when the go to nemians and they see those 'stupid' hoddys with a J on them priced around 100 bucks. then they want them not because they think there cute (well they might but in this case no) but because that girl who travels alot is wearing so it must be like pretty popular so i think ill get it too. then the next thing u no every1 is wearing it and it price value decreases cause like every1 has it. and trust me rich girls dont wear juicy anymore, polo, louis v, lacoste, seven for all mankind,true religon, the REAL desingers who dont dress people like little skank hos.
