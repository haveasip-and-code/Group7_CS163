GAFAI
An acronym for 'Going all Fruedian and Intellectual'. Refers to the tendancy of some people with predominant do-gooding tendancies, a compulsion to know what others are thinking, and strong ideology, to dissect the thoughts and actions of others and try and work out why they do and think what they do and think, and then tell them repeatedly. Those who exibit this tendancy often think they have an understanding of Phycology, and a deep understanding of the people they try to understand. Whether they do is beside the point.
