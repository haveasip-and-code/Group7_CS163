crypto-fascist
Although used on previous occasions by great scholars, such as on the TV debate between Gore Vidal and [William F. Buckley], when Vidal accused Buckley of being a 'crypto-fascist', this term was made a popular insult amongst [geeks] by the BBC sitcom [Red Dwarf]. ; A crypto-fascist is a 'hidden' supporter of fascism. It is only truly applicable to individuals, as by definition a mass movement of crypto-fascism ceases to be cryptological. That is to say, a crypto-fascist has ideologically totalitarian views, but has not yet found a movement which sufficiently reflects these views, and thus remains 'hidden'.
