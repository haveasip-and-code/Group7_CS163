Don't mess with texas
A phrase in which 'big men' from Texas (see [George W. Bush]) will use in defense of their state. ; Little do they know that it was a slogan coined in the 1960s by Ladybird Johnson in a highway beautificatoin campaign. So when you hear some macho cowboy say this, what they mean is 'Please dont litter in my state.'
