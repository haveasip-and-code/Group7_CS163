Northwestern
A socially-OK 4-year college just north of Chicago, IL, USA. Student body is composed of fair-to-poor athletes, dateless engineers-in-training, and those who are, for some reason, studying Radio, Television, and Film. Its women's lacrosse team is well known for its footwear. Not to put too fine a point on it: Charlotte Rae and David Schwimmer went there.
