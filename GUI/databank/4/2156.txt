CLOWNY
a long time ago after circuses had been revealed to local villagers and towns people, people used to have a strong fear of clowns, they used to say they were evil, and they looked like murderers. The local circus clowns made visits to the towns and villagers as they would not go to the circuses. People only ran into their homes very fast to get away from these clowns. the clowns would speak and try to make friendly conversation from the doors, but people only ignored and listened until the clowns gave up and left the areas. Then as people would come back into the outdoors gradually, they would gossip among eachother and speak of these clowns. guy 1: 'Hey, i bet they stick things into there bums after murdering people', guy 2: 'I know they do that!!!, they must, just look at them. they are soo clowny', guy 1: yeah true lol, look at robert from the village, he looks clowny too'
