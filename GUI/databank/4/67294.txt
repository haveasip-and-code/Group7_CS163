mansonite
In its simplest form, a Mansonite would be someone who listens to Marilyn Manson's music, and also agrees with his ways of thinking. Most likely a frequent poster on the Heirophant. Now a Mansonite could be some real goth who doesnt like to listen to any other stuff but NIN and MM, or it could be some poser type thinking that being a mansonite automatically makes you goth. I am a true Masonite and since when do i cut myself because thats what the goth kids do? i actaully do own clothes that are not just black (or red, if you count that) and i am quite okay with my life (a.t.m.) and i love marilyn manson not only as a band, but as a person as well, and so that is what makes me 'real'
