cuntchops
Any type of meat that shares a similar taste, consistancy, and scent of a pussy. ; How it came to be: ; Upon ordering a chicken caesar salad once, I took my first bite and realized something tasted very familar, but not like chicken. I then immediately associated it with pussy. Not only did it taste like it, but it had labial consistancy, that is, a labial feeling on my tongue, and upon a quick inhale through my nose, the scent of a washed pussy. ; I dubbed the chicken - Cuntchops.
