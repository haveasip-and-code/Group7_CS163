baggy pants
Baggy Pants is a fad in the [wigger] community where they were cloths a couple of sizes bigger. This actually started in the early 1980's by [african-american] shoplifters to allow more room to store stolen items in. The act of baggy pants was 'copied' by the [wigger] community without knowing the meaning. ; Strangly enough, [african-american][gang] members do not wear them during times of street fights. Having your pants at your knees limits mobility.
