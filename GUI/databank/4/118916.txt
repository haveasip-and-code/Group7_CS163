tiger woods
a fairly good golfer who cant admit the fact that hes BLACK just like the rest of us, no matter how many races he's mixed with (thats the whole point of being black.) ; i mean, the 37.5% Chinese, 25% of African descent, 25% Thai, and 12.5% Native American, OR 52.5% Asian, 25% of African descent, and 12.5% Native American is just to friggin stupid and a sign of desperation to be NOT black. (mariah carey has the same problem and oprah set her straight)
