zergling rush
A tactic used in Blizzard's 1998 release of 'StarCraft.' The Zerg were one of 3 playable races, bug-like creatures that created units through evolution, morhping, and hatching. The Zergling was the basic infantry unit, capable of only melee attacks. However, in a multiplayer situation, a single larva (the basic unit from which all Zerg units morph) will morph into two Zerglings, creating a cheaply made swarm at a rapid pace. Used for quick ends to multiplayer games and is often referred to in both negative and postive lights.
