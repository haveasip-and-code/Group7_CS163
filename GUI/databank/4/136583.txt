curebie
Someone who tries to cure that which cannot be cured, or that doesn't need to be cured. ; 'Curebie' is slang term used in the Autistic community to describe people who try to cure Autism - despite the fact that it has already been made perfectly clear that Autism in all of its forms is uncurable, and that people wouldn't want to be cured, anyway. It's just society trying to make them normal, they say.
