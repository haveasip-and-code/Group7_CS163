Bubbadued
Being told by someone, as part of a public group of individuals (particularly an online forum), that they stumbled across risque photos of their allegedly hot classmate online, but when prompted to provide a name so all can partake in the Google Images fun, they clam up and leave everyone with e-blueballs. Because after all, the Internet is all about privacy, particularly to the chick who has a pictoral spread already posted. Synonym of 'mathgirled'. ; (Origin/namesake: Bubbadu of AnandTech Forums; see '[syringered]')
