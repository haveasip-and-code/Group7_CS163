Bank Employee
A hapless chancer of sub-nominal intelligence commonly employed by the Bank of England. Exhibits all the characteristics of a [spaz]. Differentiated from run-of-the-mill retards by an inability to see the world outside the organisation that employs them. Unlikely to amount to anything of substance in said world.
