Period
A natural cycle that occurs within the female body every 26-30 days. Each month, an egg travels from the ovaries into the uterus, waiting for fertilisation. A lining of blood, tissue and mucus is built up during the month as a support for a embryo. If the egg is not fertilised, the linging will break down and, along with egg, will be flushed out the vagina for a duration of 3-9 days. ; Bloating, cramping and mood-swings are sings of PMS/PMT.
