The Episcopal Academy
For some reason, EA kids tend to think very highly of themselves, despite the fact that schools like Haverford, Agnes Irwin, Baldwin and Shipley are ALL better than them at basically EVERYTHING. They did not make the popped collar popped, they are not cool, they are not wealthier. Face it, they are all gay ass new money losers like Hart from that MTV bull shit show.
