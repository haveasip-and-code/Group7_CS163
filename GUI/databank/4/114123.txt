Dicer
In the Role-Playing-Game community: A dicer is someone who rolls a die a certain way to receive a desired number. There are several dicing techniques, including the drop technique where you don't actually roll the die, rather you just drop it with the desired number showing on top. See [Dice] and [Dicing]
