moshzilla
A girl photographed by Alex Stram, who was catapulted to internet fame when he posted a picture of her in an awkward pose taken at a hardcore punk show. That image was photoshopped hundreds of times and these pictures were distributed all over the web. Her pose is reminescent of Elaine from Seinfeld's kicking dance. Moshzilla had her parents threaten legal action to one website that posted these (sometimes cruel) pictures. These pictures include her as a breakdancer, a hurdler, and as free willy.
