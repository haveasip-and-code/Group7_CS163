Spaz Chariot
The Wheelchair/shopping basket combo provided by some supermarket stores so that the partially disabled can shop. ; Normally a standard motorised wheelchair type design with handlebars and a small shopping basket holder at the very front. ; For obvious reasons, the 'spaz chariot pilot' is often a subject of ridicule. 'Zoooooooom' 'whooooosh' noises as they slowly cruise past you in the aisles are mandatory.
