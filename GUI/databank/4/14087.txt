The Flood
An acient parasitic race housed on Halo. It consists of three forms, the Infection form, the combat form, and the carrier form. The infenction form latches on to a host, inserts a needle like appendage, forces a match in the hosts DNA, and mutates the host. If the host was in tact at the time of 'consumption', it is mutated into a combat form. Superior to its normal counter part, the combat form posseses superior strength and lightning speed. The hosts head is pushed back, allowing sensory organs to form, and the hosts fingers are turned into whips. If the host was to badly damaged, it turns into a combat form. The hosts head swells enourmesly, and fills with fluid and infection forms. When killed or near an opponent, the head explodes, showering the area with flood.
