Yeast Infection
1. Something a woman gets and needs Monistat-1 (or so the commercials tell me) to cure it. ; 2. A really awful shot, usually given to a friend as a gag or on their birthday. The shot consists of: 1oz Bailey's Irish Cream, 1oz Jose Cuervo Tequila, 1oz shot Captain Morgan's Original Spiced Rum.
