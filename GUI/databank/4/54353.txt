Philippines
My mom's home country. ; The Philippines was discovered by [Magellan] in the late 1500s for [King Philop] of Spain, until Magellan wore out his welcome in the Philippines and got his ass cut off and died from the natives. The Philippines is really named after the king of Spain, was also colonized by Spain at one time then later it was taken over by the Americans. Then during World War II the Japanese took control. The Philippines is also the only nation in most of Asia to be Chirstain and have a mix of many different types of cultures. The Philippines is also known to be the 'Peral of the Orient.' ; A place I want to visit someday as soon as this [War on Terrorism] is over.
