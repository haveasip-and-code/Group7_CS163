nvidia
nVIDIA is a computer company well known for their GeForce line of graphics chips (they only make the chips and sell it to card vendors) and nForce line of high performance chipsets. nVIDIA had the reputation of being the leader in the graphics section, although their rival [ATi] has quickly closed the gap in recent years and now the two companies are locked in a never ending graphics war, with both sides briefly getting an upper hand here and there.
