Former frontman for The Dead Kennedys, before the band split due to being persecuted by [Tipper Gore] for including the Giger artwork 'Penis Landscape' with their Frankenchrist album (although you can still send off the coupon included to own it if you want to). ; Since then has gone on to be a well reknowned spoken word artist/activist with several CDs to his name (Become the Media, Machine Gun in the Clown's Hand etc.) and even a Presidential candidate for the Green party. However, the rest of his former band are intent on suing him for not selling out and using classic DK standard Holiday in Cambodia in a Levis commercial. ; Also worked with Ministry in the Lard side project, and has featured on tracks for bands as diverse as Pitchshifter, Sepultura and The Presidents of the USA, with a few acting credits as well.
