Jew Camp
The various locations where Jewish kids 6 to 16 are shipped off every summer to give their parents and nannies a break from them. They all go for years and years and learn to love it and are turned into good little Jewish boys and girls. Often the location of the first kiss, first hand job, first... well let's just say there are a lot of firsts at Jew camp. (For a good example see the movie Wet Hot American Summer)
