Buffalo
a once prosperous city filled with good jobs for everyone. in fact, college wasn't even necessary, cause there were jobs for everyone that paid pretty well. however, those jobs have all been shipped to mexico, china, thailand, taiwan and india among other places where workers are slaved for pennies a day that can never buy them any of the products they make. and, of course, the prices aren't really going down. But the city is, thanks to the apathy of a neo-con federal government, which could care less about the cities that built america, a state government that worries only about the so-called troubles of new york city, a city government that takes the little bit of federal and state money and pockets it into their own payraises and doesnt even attempt to solve problem, and a county government bureaucracy that only works part-time, gets paid more than double the salary of the avergae full-time worker in america, has no sense of creative thought, overstaffs itself and expects others to get rid of their so called patronage when they wont get rid of theirs. basically the great city has been fucked over.
