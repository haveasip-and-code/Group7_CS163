Wanderlust
One of the best shows to ever grace Comedy Central. Focusing on a German Traveller going around the world, the character [Gehard Reinke] would make fun of locals, get into some trouble of his own, and even experience some of the naitive's traditions. Best of all, he would often get a theme at the beginning of the show (Example: Pee Shyness or tracking down Big Foot), and would turn his vacation upside down. ; Sadly, the show was cancelled after 6 Episodes.
