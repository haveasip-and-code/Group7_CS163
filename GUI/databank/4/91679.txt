shop
To 'borrow' permanently from a sibling. Derived from the appearance of a sibling strolling through your closet or CD/DVD collection, looking at all the merchandise, placing selected items into their virtual shopping cart, saying 'hey, can I borrow this shirt, your Abbey Road CD, and The Matrix?', and never returning any of the items, causing you to eventually steal back all your stuff next Thanksgiving.
