Star Fox Assault
The worst game in the [Star Fox]series. ; The whole point of this game was to make the morons who hated Star Fox Adventues happy, cause Rare didn't want a plot go to waste. First of all the game is way too short and can beaten under 4 hours. To make it worst 6 of the 10 missions are crappy ground mission where with terrible controls, you go around with Fox blowing up random objects untill all the red dots on the radar are gone. There's also the lackluster Vs. mode which has no AI bots or Capture the Flag mode. With the expection of 3 Vs levels (Orbital gate, Corneia, and Great Fox)the music is terrible, it sounds like the crap you would hear off a [Kids Bop] Album. But there are lots of unlockables which one of them is Xevious where you could get by beating the game on Sliver medal mode. You can get more unlockables by playing Vs matches, but unless you have 2 or 3 friends, this process will be incredibly boring. Overall Star Fox Assault is a crappy game. I would advise that you only rent this game.
