Gareth Keenan
A character from BBC's The Office played brilliantly by Mackenzie Crook who always gets the piss taken out of him (even though he probably always deserves it) by office-mate Tim Canterbury. ; Used to be in the Territorial Army, and now works at Wernham-Hogg paper company in Slough where he is Assistant Regional Manager... erm, excuse me, Assistant TO the Regional Manager.
