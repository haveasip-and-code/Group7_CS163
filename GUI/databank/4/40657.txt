MSN
An internet service, MSN *does* stand for Microsoft Network, Wikipedia it... ; 95% of n00bs and teenagers use the acronym MSN referring to MSN Messenger, which is not only incorrect, but heavily annoys some people (myself included). If anyone ever uses this in anything sent to you, make sure you correct them.
