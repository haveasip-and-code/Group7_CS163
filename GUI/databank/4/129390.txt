Or Over There
A more sarcastic version of 'or not' said when you are excited to see someone you know walk in the caf, ball game, classroom, lounge, union, etc. And you motion to the person to come over (while simulataneously making space for them at your table, area, row, etc) and then the person keeps walking or totally ignores you and goes to sit with there real friends.
