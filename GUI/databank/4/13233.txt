otherkin
Otherkin is a group of people who believe that in some way, they are not completely human. Some think they are a reincarnation of mythological beings, aliens, animals native to this planet, etc. Others think they've descended from ancient elvish or fae bloodlines and what have you. Probably most rarely, even some believe that they are existing on this plane in their 'trueform' but under a 'seeming,' which from what I know is some sort of magical disguise. ; While a vast majority of 'kin are most likely vying for attention and many may indeed be delusional, there are those who lead quite normal lives and are quite happy with the way things are.
