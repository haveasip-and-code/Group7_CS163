called back
Basically what happens when you and your buddy have planned a trip for several months,and his wife knows that your going. You dealay leaving home on the day you plan on leaving and actually depart on the morning she wants you too, and drive three and 1/2 hours to get to a Kroger grocery store in West Virginia, only to find that you've been called back due to her personal insecurity about being alone.
