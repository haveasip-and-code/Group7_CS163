Joe Cell
An alternative Fuel source to oil etc. ; It was invented by an Australian man called Joe X who now wants nothing to do with the technology, therefore it is now more appropriate to call it the Water Cell. ; It works by running an electrical current through distilled water separated by a number of stainless steel rings, then after charging begins to emit a form of gas derived from zero-point energy, the gas was originally believed to be hydrogen but has since been proven incorrect as the water acts as a catalyst, thus to produce hydrogen it would use up the water. ; The Joe Cell is being researched by organisations such as ByronNewEnergy.com and other individuals around the world. ; Water is clean, natural, and the way of the future.
