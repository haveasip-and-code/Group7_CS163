Jello Biafra
Stage name of Eric Boucher (sp) and the smartest man ever to walk the earth. After the disbandment of the Dead Kennedys (his former group of which he was the singer for), he began to release solo spoken-word albums with his opinions on society and political well-beings. A self-proclaimed anarchist, and a guy I would definately love to meet.
