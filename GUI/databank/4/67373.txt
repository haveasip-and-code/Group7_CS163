quexclamation mark
It is a hybridization of a question and exclamation mark. Instead of using '!?!?!??!?!?!' in a surpirised situation when writing not typing use the quexclamation mark. It has the rounded top of a question mark but a straight line of a exclamation mark and a dot. It kinda looks like a '7'.
