To make a blog entry or post that is simultaneously mysterious and utterly mundane. It must be both melodramatic and vague, even though it's probably about something totally simple, such as a girl finding herself attracted to a boy. ; It should also be availible to the widest possible audience, in the hope that someone will give a flying fuck.
