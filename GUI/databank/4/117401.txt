dale earnhardt
One of the greatest race car drivers ever, who held 7 championships until he died at the age of 49 in the 2001 Daytona 500, when on the last lap, last turn he suddenly drifted down to the apron and barreled straight on to the retaining wall going an estimated 185 mph. His restraint snapped on impact and was instantly killed, and the interior of the car was badly damaged, and very bloody. Even drivers in other racing types consider Dale Earnhardt to be a true racing legend.
