trabant builder
A programmer who insists upon writing user-hostile code, simply because it's easier to do and doesn't want to admit their own lazyness and contempt for end users. ; Most (but not all) Linux programmers are Trabant Builders. ; Background: Communist East Germany produced a car called the Trabant. By some accounts it was an engineering marvel, as it could be built and taken apart using only 3 or 5 spanners. However, it was a rather pathetic car and nobody in their right mind drove one by choice.
