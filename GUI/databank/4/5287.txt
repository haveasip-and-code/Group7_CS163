Newbury Park
A city full of rich white republicans. The epitome of the California lifestyle. The Parents are all doctors, lawyers and surgeons, and their kids all drive BMW's and Range Rovers. Some kids pretend to be poor and emo, and buy black clothes from Nordstrom, but at the end of the day, they get in their Jaguar, and drive to their mansion in Dos Vientos Ranch.
