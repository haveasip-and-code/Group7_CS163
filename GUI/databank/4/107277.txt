Dharma
This is not my definition, but a definition given to me by a bona fide spiritual guru: ; 'Dharma means the intrinsic nature of a thing. Just like the dharma of sugar is sweetness and the dharma of water is wetness. The dharma of the living being is to render service ; to God. Therefore everyone serves God without fail, either directly or indirectly. The devotees serve Him directly and the non-devotees serve Him indirectly.'
