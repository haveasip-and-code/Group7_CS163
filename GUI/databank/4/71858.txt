Violent Techno Thursday
A holiday celebrated on every Thursday. This is a day where violence is tolerated more than normally and you and/or a group of friends create some phat techno beats. [Neon Lollipop Jukebox] is the original techno band that started this beloved holiday. It's origin derives from someone saying, 'It's finally Thursday!' and it was misinterpreted as, 'It's Violent Thursday!'. The techno part comes in only because we were creating techno that very day.
