Stewie Griffon
WEll it's Griffin not Griffon. ; Stewart Gilligan Griffin is the football headed, 1 year old, youngest child of Lois and Peter Griffin on the tv show, Family Guy. He is easily the coolest one on the show simply because he is bent on world domination but is still overcome by the simple weeknesses of a 1 year old, such as a binky or the dreaded Teletubbies.
