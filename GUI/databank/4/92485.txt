Body Builders
Usually small minded males trying to overcompensate for their small penile size by revving up their ego. Supposed to be the manliest of men, most come off as gay, since their enormous petruding muscles and small red bikinis tend to repel sane women. They constantly converse with fellow body builders over their daily protein intake or steroid use. Most tend to not be flexible, and they always carry a bottle of self bronzer and or baby oil.
