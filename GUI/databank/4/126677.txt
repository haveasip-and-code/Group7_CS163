grierson
The act of causing rapid evacuation of a room or other confined space by floating a particularly nasty [air biscuit]. Most commonly, a grierson requires the assistance of a [tarka] for maximal effect. The word is derives from the name of a rotund large-eared red-headed gentleman scholar of an unathletic nature (not to be confused with a [waby]), who claimed to be able to clear the audience of a 300-seat lecture theatre in 10 seconds.
