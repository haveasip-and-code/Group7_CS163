Also see [Fascist_tyrant] and/or [feudal_juggernaut] and/or [road_warrior_davy] ; In the year 1999 Yahoo! chat was revolutionized by a man known by many names; Taran, Ba'al, Aiden, Cyril, many more, and foremost, Davy. Through the golden age of Yahoo! (1999-2001) through the fall of the Metal:1 empire (late 2003) 'Davy' or 'Thundersteel Von Battletrance' oppressed the peoples of Yahoo! Metal rooms 1-4 with an iron fist. Using ingenius stealth name tactics in his early operations to scout attack and loot a room of up to 40 regs (sometimes with no more than 3 Loyalists), Davy's regime grew in power until expansionism forces held territories in Black Metal/Abusing Females:1, Music chat, Punk chat, The Guitar room network and Jewish Teens:1. The end came when the 3rd wave of Indian fat women launched an allied advance on Metal:1 (previously thought untouchable) with the support of Metal Daze, Metal Teers, Wicked Clownz, various other barbarian outlanders, and the native Metal:1 peasant class uprising. The Regime had exiled these forces seperately before but together the sheer mass of low quality numbers could not be held off even by the most dominant empire in Yahoo! chat history. The stronghold was lost. The dreams of many shattered.
