Grill Dash
when you have a veggie burger or something under the grill, and you wander back to the computer and get hooked on ebay or msn and forget what you are cooking. Suddenly theres that unmistakeable burning charcoal smell and then you suddenly remember you were grilling something and have a mad dash to the grill to be presented with something black and frazzled.
