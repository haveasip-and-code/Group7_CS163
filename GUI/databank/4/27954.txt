long beach island
the fuckin mecca of all its the zion of the shores. this place has everything specially beach haven 'the queen city' good shit goes down in here. first off the surf....holyoake....is good i rep my hood though down at belvoir. Next schooners warf (the thing the other kid who wrote on the lbizzle said) it pretty much sucks cept for some parts too many fuckin new york fuckin wiggers who think they are tough shit. and way too many new york acsent skanky bitches who have prolly been penetrated by these [wigger]s. barrys is the good food place....good people good place. LBI is just a great place when you find girls who are hot they are amazing...hot and cool as hell not like those nyc girlies. this beach beats out all the other 'shores' like avalon, oc, stone harbour and Atlantic city
