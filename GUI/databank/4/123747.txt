You can hate me if you want  I'm not changing for nothing
A phrase that can be said in self-defense when someone is verbally harassing you. It implies that you do not care if they hate you for what you are or what you do, and that you will not conform to their ways to satisfy them. Useful in situations involving politics, choosing sides in an argument, etc. It is a perfect saying when you are under verbal attack by hate-filled people.
