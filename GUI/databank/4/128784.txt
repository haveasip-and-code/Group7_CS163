Winter Rose
A Canadian [glam]/[hair metal] band popular in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the late 1980s. Now disbanded, the group originally consisted of: Kevin [James LaBrie] (vocals), Randy Cooke (drums), Lou Pomanti (keyboards), Robert Laidlaw (bass), Bruce Dies (guitar), and Richard Chycki (guitar). [James LaBrie] and Rich Chycki have remained in contact since the vocalist was hired by New York [progressive metal] band [Dream Theater]. They have since worked together on some of LaBrie's solo albums as a sound engineer and producer.
