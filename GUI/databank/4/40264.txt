Sideshow
This is official Town Bizness! The sideshow started at lest twenty years ago in Deep East Oakland, CA. In the ghetto Eastmont mall parking lot. Now it can happen anywhere that Oakland people congregate.We might show up in your city next! It is an impromptu, car show. We ride the strip, stunt, get at, or mingle with the opposite sex, do donuts, figure 8's, hang out the windows while we drive, drive wit the doors open and basically do it real live, Yadada-mean! No one and I mean no one has a strip that cracks harder than the infamous Deep East Oakland, 'Foothill Strip'. Str8 Up!
