Release Group
A group of people who pirate software for public release. ; Release groups are also known as Ripping crews, as they will often rip sound or video from the games. Cd protections are often removed as well. ; Most, if not all groups are strictly against selling their work. And they release games for evaluation purposes only. So gamers dont have to blow $60 just to see if a game is good.
