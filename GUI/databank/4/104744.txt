panegyric
A eulogistic oration or writing, similar to an [elegy] with the difference being in its higher level of formality. A highly complex and specialized piece of music devoted to the eulogy of a person or thing may possibly be refered to as a panegyric instead of an [elegy], though this use is rare.
