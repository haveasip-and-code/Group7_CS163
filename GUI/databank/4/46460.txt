Plano
A suburb of Dallas, it breifly flashed into national news-worthiness when blacktop heroin found its way there in the late 90's, leading to a slew of deaths. It can be divided into 2 regions ; A. West: The newer part, it also has a higher per capita income(on the order of $100,000-$120,000). Its schools are still a hotbed of drug activity due to the high preponderance of bored, rich kids, but heroin has fallen out of favor. ; B. East: Considered by most Plano-ites, to be the 'ghetto' section of Plano, the vast majority is still upper-middle class. It however lacks the number of shopping malls/ multiplexes/ etc. that have arose in the west side during the building boom that hit the DFW area in the 90's.
