HDTV
Stands for 'High Definition Television'. A kick ass video format with resolutions of 720p (1280x720 pixels progressive), 1080i (1920x1080 pixels interlaced) and 1080p (1920x1080 pixels progressive). Can be up to 6 times the quality of standard definition video. Using a proper HDTV (not an EDTV) viewing medium, it can be as good as looking through a window.
