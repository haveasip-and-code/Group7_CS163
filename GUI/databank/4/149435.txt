Bedroom Community
A suburban community/town with little to no major employment center(s) to call its own. People only seem to sleep there when they're not working 80 Hrs./wk closer in to the city where the jobs are. The only commercial space is retail & services for the residents (banks, groceries, malls, etc.) Residents often choose bedroom communities because of affordablility relative to living closer to the city, lower perceived crime, and schools with students that look just like their kids.
