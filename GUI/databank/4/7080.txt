Tohru Honda
A girl from the series Fruits Basket/Furuba/Furutsu Basketto. She encounters the Sohma family and learns there curse. Her mother died in a car crash months before she learned of it so she decided to live with her grandfather. When her grandfather decided to move with her cousins, Tohru lived in a tent until the Sohma's found out. She is caring, un-selfish, and bubbly. In my opinion, she is a borderline Mary-Sue. She feeds of peoples pity for her and wants to make 'friends' Yeah right. She softens EVERYONES hearts and makes EVERYONE end up liking her. Including Akito and Hiro!
