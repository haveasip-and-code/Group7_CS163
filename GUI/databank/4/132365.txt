militantly ignorant
1. n., [Peeps] who rigorously eschew all forms of mental stimulation, on the feeble premise that either [God] or [evolution] will teach us all that we need to know. They may vocally oppose education, and believe that writing is something that only writers do. They sometimes brag about having no sense of size, quantity, or direction. ; The militantly ignorant rarely read books or even magazines or newspapers, admit that they don't enjoy the [fine arts], have a poor sense of history, can't find [Nevada] or [Pakistan] on a globe, and avoid watching the [news] on [TV]. They don't own [library card]s or use [technology], except as a joke or novelty, believing [digital] [productivity] and [entertainment] to be waning fads, and are easily recognized by holding materials upside down while [reading], unless they contain pretty pictures. What informational channels they do expose themselves to through TV or movies are usually either [drivel] or very [low-grade]. ; They are greatly relieved to be unaware of the existence of resources such as [NPR] or the [Internet]. They can't read, spell, or even speak very well, don't recognize or use many words, frequently substitute similarly sounding words for what they really mean, take violent offense at innocent comments, and otherwise [misconstrue] most statements containing words longer than three syllables. ; Unfortunately, such people rarely study or try to improve themselves or their work, (if they actually do any), and can only poorly define their misconceptions, much less defend them. Should they attempt to describe a problem, they will most likely describe it as a [thingy] that [acted funny]. This may have seemed cute when they were small, but if such seemingly cute ignorance is excessively rewarded when people are small, they learn to adopt ignorance as a strategy for obtaining affection, and eventually their brains atrophy from disuse and they can't learn more mature strategies. ; (Source: jehovah.to/glos/=M.html #militantly_ignorant) ; 2. adj., [Stupid] [on purpose].
