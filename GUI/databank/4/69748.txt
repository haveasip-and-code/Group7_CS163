yupaloopa
A combination of the words yak and oompa loompa. Originally coming from watching Willy Wonka and pausing it halfway through as animal planet came on and showed a documentary on yaks. Being two and the morning and nothing better to do the word yupaloopa was created thus dawning the birth of a new insult. Mainly to be used against males with out of control facial hair, that are preferably midgets or under 5 foot 5.
