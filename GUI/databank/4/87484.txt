Z-Trip
Hip-hop DJ from Phoenix, AZ. Widely regarded as the top party-rocking DJ in the world, Z-Trip is mostly known for blending many types of music styles and genres into his mix sets, which was fairly rare for hip-hop DJs until recently. He released his first studio album 'Shifting Gears' in 2005.
