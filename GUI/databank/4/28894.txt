blind date
somthing i wouldnt suggest you go on.- most turn out to be incredibly ugly , boring or plain losers.. But there are a few that turn out to be gems once in awhile or at least dateable. Id say about 3 out of 50 are the odds of you finding someone whos compatible with you on a blind date. Its best if your friends set you up with this person rather than just calling up some line or other service and going on a blind date. The friends at least know what you like and most likely who you would like, as far as type. Sometimes youll get a whacko sometimes youll get a good match, But the odds of the good match are very low. Maybe 1 in 50-100 and 2 that are dateable not to bad. The rest are whack jobs. So try to meet peeps in public or work , somewhere you dont need to go on a blind date.
