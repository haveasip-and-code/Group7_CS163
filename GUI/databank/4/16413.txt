fenguin
Fenguin: From the English 'Penguin' and 'Funnel' ; A Fenguin is a hybrid creature created by breeding a funnel with a penguin, or, in vox populi 'A fenguin is what happens when a Penguin and a Funnel get too friendly '. A rare creature indeed, but we can be thankful for that, because Fenguins have the disturbing habit of mating with the inferior extremities of anything they encounter.
