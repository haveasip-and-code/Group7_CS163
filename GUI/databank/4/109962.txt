moon bat
A typical ad-hominem insult devised by conservative media personae. Used to smear politicians, actors, singers, community leaders, philosophers and regular citizens who speak out against any injustice carried out by any member of either the Republican party or any other highly conservative power. Basically, if you don't tow the party line completely or if you question the judgement of the President or Republican leadership, you're a 'moon bat,' (completely insane.)
