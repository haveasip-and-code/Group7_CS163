Chip Caray
A TV announcer for the Atlanta Braves. Used to be the play-by-play announcer for the Chicago Cubs, and sucked at it. He used the words a 'whale' of a play and so forth. His jokes were unfunny. (See example). Him and analyst [Steve Stone] are now replaced by the even more unfunny, Dusty Baker ass-kissers Len Kasper, and Bob Brenly. Chip also seemed to love Craig Biggio, A LOT.
