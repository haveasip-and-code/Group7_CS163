moongoat
Very very very very very very very scary and carnivorous goats with big horns and pointy fangs. They feed on posers, fags and poser-fags, that cannot be included in the Necrowizard's blasphemous plan of Planet Norway. Moongoats are known to blasphemously drag the Necrowizards unholy necrobobsled, across the perpetually grim and Norwegiously frostbitten moonfjords of Abazagorath!
