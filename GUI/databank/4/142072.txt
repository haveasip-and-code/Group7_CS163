frostwire
An alternative to a popular p2p client Limewire. Frostwire runs on the same network (gnutella) as limewire and basically there are few differences between the two.People use frostwire nowdays because it doesn't have 'copyright protection filters' like limewire does. ; Frostwire came out in September 2005 and was made by a group of volunteers because RIAA threatened to sue limewire if they didn't stop the spreading of copyrighted material.So instead of going into court limewire implemented filters in their search engines (on their new versions) so people can't have access to 'illegal stuff'. But people liked the service limewire was providing so a bunch of people got together and made an alternative to limewire called frostwire.
