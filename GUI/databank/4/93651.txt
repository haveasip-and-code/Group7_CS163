decatur
City located a few miles east of Atlanta. Contrary to other definitions, Decatur is NOT mostly farmland but an urban environment featuring both housing projects and million-dollar condos. The first Waffle House is located in neighboring Avondale Estates and was founded by graduates of Decatur High School. In recent years, an influx of really fucking gay people has earned the city such titles as 'dikeatur' and 'Dickatur'
