so does
My friends and I have started a project. We call it...'So does.' ; The purpose of this project? Drive everyone in the world insane, take their money, and then rule Earth and maybe Jupiter, if we can conquer it. ; Anywho, what you do is this: Put the words, 'So does' everywhere. Write it on your teacher's white board every day when she's not looking. Scribble it on your desk. Write it on a piece of paper and leave it somewhere. Write it in yearbooks, on reports, on your website, in your signature, on forums, in journals, on nametags--Everywhere! Go through the garbage and write it on tin cans and cardboard boxes. Carve it into rocks and trees, trace the words into the sand. ; I know what you're thinking: This is completely retarded. ; Yes, it is. ; But so what? Or, more importantly: So does?
