church wine
When someone asks for a sip of your drink, be it alcoholic or non-alcoholic, telling them to church wine it is saying just touch the liquid to your lips and that's all you're getting. This comes from the eucharist part of a Catholic mass in which wine is presented to be gently sipped, not drank.
