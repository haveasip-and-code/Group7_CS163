stress
its a california slang term which defines a type of weed that is so shitty it causes 'stress'. the slang originated from the outskirts of southern californian beaches which was passed along until it reached the main cities. many tourists come to CA looking for bomb ass chronic, or [chron], but end up with stress because they don't understand CA slang.
