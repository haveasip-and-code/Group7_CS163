Orthodox
Orthodox Christianity begins with the first Pentecost in Jerusalem and the spreading of the Holy Spirit on Christ's small circle of disciples. It is then that the Orthodox Church was born, today the second largest organized body of Christians in the world. The legal recognition of Christianity was by the Emperor Constantine at the beginning of the fourth century (312AD) and its recognition as the official religion of the Byzantium empire by the end, under Theodosius (392AD).
