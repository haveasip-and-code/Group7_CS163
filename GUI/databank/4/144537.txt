Muralitharan
Muralitharan (or '[Murali]' as he is commonly known) is the greatest off spinner in the history of [cricket]. In 2002, Wisden (who are considered to be the [Bible] of [cricket]) named him 'the greatest [bowler] ever'. Former Australian [cricket] captain [Steve Waugh] has said that Muralitharan is second only to [Donald Bradman] in terms of greatness on the cricket field. ; Muralitharan has an unorthodox bowling action, the legitimacy of which has been questioned a number of times. Each time, scientific evidence has appeared to exonerate the bowler. Despite this, the controversy over his bowling action refuses to lie down, even though in recent times, a number of his critics have changed their stance. West Indian Michael Holding, and Australian Dean Jones who once categorically stated that Muralitharan was cheating, have now changed their minds saying that the scientific evidence in support of Muralitharan is overwhelming. ; Despite this, the Sri Lankan off spinner continues to receive criticism from various circles. A lot of this negative publicity has to do with the infamous '[Doosra]' that Muralitharan has developed. ; [Murali] also has a strong fan club. English commentator Mark Nichollas and Australian Bruce Yardley are avid supporters of Muralitharan. The off spinner also commands great respect in the cricket world due to the vast amounts of humanitarian work he undertakes.
