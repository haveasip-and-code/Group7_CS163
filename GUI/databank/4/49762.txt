Wuss Rock
Supposed 'rock' music that is a contradition in and of itself. Music that is not about expressing the raw emotion or energy that is rock, but instead a kind of masterbatory limp sadness. Some of the best rock contains elements of sadness and helplessness, but honestly express their frustrations through modes of both melancholic somberness as well as ventilative 'rocking out.' Instead of regaining one's power through the 'rock', 'Wuss rock' does the very opposite and allows the crybaby whose girlfriend dumped him to continue crying into his perfume-scented pillow.
