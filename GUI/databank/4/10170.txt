Carl's Jr commercials
Carl's Jr commercials feature obnoxious portions and combinations of food that are merely ideological in intent. Nobody would seriously eat a double six-dollar burger with bacon and guac, but they're advertised anyway. The goal is to affirm the macho, guy-like, over-the-top, gonzo style that currently defines American masculinity. Other examples include raised pick-up trucks, Calvin peeing stickers, and driving like an asshole.
