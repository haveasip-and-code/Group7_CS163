Sage Francis
Independent Hip-Hop Artist who breaks all ground in poetry to further break the vines off our country and it's perception towards ideas, thoughts and situations expressed through his tracks. Incredibly skillfull, an asshole in audio but a class act in concert, a bearded crusader of wordplay for emo kids to finally relate (to hip-hop) to without painting their faces is mascara. Above all else, one of the most intelligent humans beings to grace the microphone, and truly deserves the title of Mover of the Crowd (MC). ; Climb Trees, from Portland Oregon.
