romo
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and other mixed martial artists use this term in order to describe homosexuals. A twist on the Portuguese language where every first 'R' in a word is pronounced with an 'H'. The name 'Ryan' would be pronounced 'Hyan'. 'Romo'='Homo'. Portuguese is a popular language among fighters because of the impact of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in the No Holds Barred fighting world. Just in case you didn't know, Brazilians speak Portuguese.
