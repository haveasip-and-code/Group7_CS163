albinism
A disorder that a person is born with, which isn't contageous. If you have it, you're born with a lack of pigment (skin and hair color) and most of the time, legal blindness. A person with albinism is commonly called an 'albino' even though it is considered politically incorrect. I'm albino, and I find it fine, stupid people don't want to admit who they are.
