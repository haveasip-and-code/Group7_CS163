grappa
The writer doesn't know Greeks. They have their ouzo. It is Turks who call it raki. Mikrasian Greeks, i.e., Greeks from Asian Minor {Turkey] refer to it as ouzo. But ouzo, raki, etc is closer to French pastis, like Pernod. This is flavored with anise and usually diluted by pouring in water, or in this country, serving it over ice. Grappa, for those who know how to drink it, is taken neat, and does not have anise. The lesser stuff can taste like rocket fuel. The higher grades are excellent. Grappa warms chilly bones.
