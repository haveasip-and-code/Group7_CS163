cyber terrorism
Cyber terrorism is ACTUALLY something much more serious than hacking into computers. It is a far reaching problem, where terror groups do things that mess with our electronics as a whole. Cell phones acting screwy, cable going in and out, computers doing weird stuff... its all-inclusive. They are attacking us slowly in an effort to cripple the medium that we unknowingly have become uber-dependent on; our electronics.
