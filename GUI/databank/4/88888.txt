ap calculus
Class offered in some high schools. Introduces pretty basic mathematical concepts compared to 'advanced' math. Frequently described as 'impossible,' 'retarded,' and 'useless' by many students, but occasionally enjoyed by uber-nerds who later go on to become obscenely rich and hire the aforementioned students as manservants.
