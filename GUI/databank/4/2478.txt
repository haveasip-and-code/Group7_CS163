Fictitious alien race from Douglas Adam's ; [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] series of books, television shows and radio plays. ; Vogons are reknowned for their bad poetry, dislike of hitchhikers, bad temper and tendency to blow up mostly harmless planets. ; Most Vogons tend to become bureaucrats for the galactic government, a profession ideally suited to their unpleasent natures. ; A prime example of a Vogon is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, captain of the Vogon constructor fleet that demolished the planet [Earth] to make way for a hyperspace bypass.
