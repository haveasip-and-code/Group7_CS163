M4
An extremely powerful assault rifle used by special forces and the U.S. military; it uses the 5.56 mm round. An M203 (grenade launcher) can be attached under its short barrel to cause maximum damage and doom. It is black with pink polka-dots and a lot of naked lumberjacks use them. Lumberjack slams are also delicious. They are eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and parsley. They taste slammingly tasty.
