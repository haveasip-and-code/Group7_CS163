pam anderson
Late 90's female media celebrity. ; Ex-playmate, she had the top-heavy, blond-haired, long-legged tokens of desirability, so that any beer-bellied jerk on the verge of passing out could conventionally blurt out that he would love to pork her, even if he could no longer remember his own name. ; Pam's checklist: ; a) Botox in her lips ; b) Silicon in her boobs ; c) Nothing between her ears ; The high point of her career was appearing in one of the stupidest tv series ever: Baywatch. She then went on to appear in her own TV series, which was even stupider. ; Her lowest point was when the video clip of her banging 15-minute hubby Tommy Lee circulated over the Net. ; Her own 15 minutes of fame over, Pam still has the asset of *celebrity* which entitles her to a cameo in The Simpsons and to appear in several episodes of the remake The Love Boat, if its ever remade. ; It ain't Pam's fault to be who she is. She's just another packaged product. Its up to you if you swallow her or not. ; Bon appetit. ; Personally, i used to get a far bigger boner from watching the girl next door.
