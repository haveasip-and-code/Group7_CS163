matco
Matco is one of the worst ISP in Romania, due the fact it offers very fast ping (20 ms), it offers a great speed (something like 1.5 kb/s) for 100$/month through ADSL. The tehnical support is the worst thing possible, taking into account that some fucking fag0ts are ruling this company and if you don't suck your dick you won't get high quality internet.
