chav gang
A chav gang typically consists of a bunch of about 15 identicle 8-11 year olds and one socially retarded 18-30 year old who is unable to relate to people his own age. All dressed in the same chav labels from head to toe and baseball caps pushed up to a useless angle. Main activities include throwing things, smashing things and shouting random chav incomprehensible gibberish that they think is funny but is actually exactly the same phrase as every chav has ever yelled at passers by.
