Bridgewater State College
A school of higher learning where all you do is drink rubinoff vodka 4 days a week and take a bus around campus especially to [Tilly] for fun food bar and chicken parm. Located in between Boston and Providence and close to Cape Cod. There is an annoying train that goes through campus 15 times a day. Do not take [Stan Ross] as a teacher. Bridgewater is also the home of alot of fine bitches. There is also greek life which sucks because the girls are ugly. ; WARNING: Dont feed the Grizzly!! ; and stay away from 302 Durgin because gay rape was commited in there
