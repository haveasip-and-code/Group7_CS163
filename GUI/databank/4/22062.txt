nativity play
A play about a ridiculous thing that was COMPLETELY blown out of proportion. Basically, Mary cheats on Joseph with a guy who could have been called Tony. She can't bear the thought of A)Upsetting her husband B)Being stoned to death by an excited crowd of civilians, on account of comitting adultary. So, she takes her chances and tells the gullable Joseph that God came down from the heavens and did the dirty on her, resulting in Mary being pregnant with the so-called 'son of god'. For generations and generations, this far-fetched story has been passed on, and more and more gullable people have been persuaded that Jesus was the son of a virgin. C'mon guys. Let's be realistic here.
