liberal (n)
A person lacking in moral convictions, tending to react irrationally and often ignorantly with regard to any formal argument involving anything they dissagree with. Do not waste time trying to come up with rational explinations, as it is a waste of time and far less satisfactory than a firm backhand to the smacker.
