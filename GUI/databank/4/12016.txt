The most notorious, if not the greatest, heavy metal guitarist of all-time, with a great attitude, and an unrivaled passion for the genre of music and all that it stood for - the ultimate epitome of heavy metal, usually found on a stage in a small club, medium-sized auditorium or large arena, wielding his guitar like a battle axe and emitting gut-wrenching walls of sound to hundreds of banging heads.
