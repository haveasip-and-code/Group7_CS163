catdog
The biggest piece of shit television cartoon that ever existed about a creature that's half dog and half cat. The father (dog) wanted a dog, and the mother (cat) wanted a cat...as if it's hard to figure to have fucking twins. The 'humor' is totally dark, negative, and have no funny qualitites whatsoever.
