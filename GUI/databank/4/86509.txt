beat the hell out
Back in the day, before psychology really developed, when someone was considered 'crazy' they would thing the devil was in them. Instead of treating them wiht medication, therapy, ect... They would do horrible things to them like drill holes in their heads to let the evil spirits out, or beat them to death out of fear of what is inside.
