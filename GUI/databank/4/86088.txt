Liberal A.K.A Antiwar protester
Someone who recognizes that the current Neo-Conservative trend of the use of force for political and economic gain denigrates the sacrifices made by those who died in legitimate conflicts where the freedoms of the US were actually threatened by an outside entity. Many so called 'Liberals A.K.A Antiwar protesters' are former soldiers who have seen the evils perpetrated by the use of the military and the devastation delivered upon innocent populations by the destruciton of their infrastructures in campaigns of 'shock and awe'ordered by draft dodging pieces of crap sitting in comfortable offices in Washington.
