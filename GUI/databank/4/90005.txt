bergenfield
Small suburban town in Northern New Jersey. Bergenfield is only 10 minutes away from New York City. Everyone in Bergenfield wants to be 'gangster.' There is also a huge Filipino population that is now growing exponentially, who also try to act gangster. THere is a very small minority of people in Bergenfield that are actually themselves. Bergenfield has been written about in books and news articles and over time, bergenfield has become a 'teenage wasteland.' The educational system in Bergenfield is horrible and there seems to be no hope for improvement. Bergenfield is a great tourist site if u want to go somewhere where there is absolutelty nothing to do and no where to go.
