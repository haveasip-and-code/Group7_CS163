Heresy
The act of going against the teachings of the [Bible] and the refusal to believe in the Almighty [God]. The politically correct term for this today is [Atheism]. This is something committed by seemingly hundreds of millions of people all over the world today. Tens of millions of people in the United States alone are heretics (the same as [Atheist]). The cause of all of this heresy is because of the move towards Secularism (non-religious), a more [liberal] culture, and the enhancement of transportation and greater communication technology, which links to everything in the outside world and the various regions of this nation.
