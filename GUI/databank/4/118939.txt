NP>OP=everytime
New Pussy beats Old Pussy everytime. The equation is reserved for males who despite having a steady girlfriend feel compelled to search out new sexual partners. Often associated with the boredom of experiencing one woman over and over again. The idea that getting something new is always better than repeating the old.
