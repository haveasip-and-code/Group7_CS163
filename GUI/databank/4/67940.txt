Jolt Cola
Back when I was living in Michigan where I could get this beverage at the local Quality Dairy convenience store, it was my buzz. This was before I started sippin' [energy drink]s for a buzz. I remember easily getting wired off of Jolt, and just kickin' it old school, listening to the radio and sippin' my Jolt while playing DarkStalkers 3 on my PlayStation. It has twice the caffeine as Pepsi and about 35% more caffeine than Mountain Dew. Jolt is hard to find now, and doesn't even stand up to a can of [BooKoo] anyway, so now I sip energy drinks while I play [Pocket Tanks] or DarkStalkers.
