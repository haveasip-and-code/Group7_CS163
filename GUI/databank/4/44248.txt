Les Enfants Terribles
Root: 'The Les Enfants Terribles Project' referenced in the Metal Gear Solid video games. It used Gene Therapy to create the Genome Army as well as both Sold Snake and Liquid Snake through the analysis and cloning of Big Boss's genes. ; It means literally 'the terrible children' in French, which makes sense because all the clones/sons of Big Boss are trained killers.
