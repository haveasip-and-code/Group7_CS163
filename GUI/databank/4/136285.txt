kubuntu
An integrated [Linux] [distro] with all the great features of [Ubuntu], but based on the [KDE] desktop. A good thing about Kubuntu is that it is free and can be downloaded, used, and upgraded for no money at all. Kubuntu can be either run off of a [liveboot] CD, or installed. Kubuntu is a good OS for people who are new to [Linux].
