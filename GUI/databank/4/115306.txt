gaara
sabaku no gaara (or gaara of the desert), born the youngest child of the kazekage and brother to [temari] and [kankuro]. a demon (shukaku) was sealed inside him at a VERY early age and made his life miserable henceforth, he went on to unconciously kill his mother, and the sand village basically wanted him dead, although they never succeeded at killing the child. not unlike a timebomb, gaara became a vile shinobi and felt an inate need to kill others... that is until he learned from [naruto] that there are other ways of dealing with pain and the overall antics of being a shinobi. ; his abilities are ridiculously powerful and resourceful, for example the handseal that creates the avalanche of sand, capable of burying opponents alive and then creating a shockwave (sabaku taiso) to obliterate them.
