Onahan Elementry School
1. A hellish school where you make the best friends you think you will ever have, and in a split second you lose them and there they are, stabbing you in the back. Where half of the teachers have NO idea what they're talking about, and treat us like shit. They spend the whole time telling us to 'respect' eachother, and the other teachers, when god knows they sure as hell dont respect us. ; 2. A building that smells like ass. moldy ass, that is what it smells like
