45 spider
An adaptor that allows large-hole 45 RPM records to be played on record players with a normal spindle. ; A cheap, plastic gadget that snapped into the large center holes of 7-inch 45 records; unlike adaptors that were placed on the record player itself, these were meant to be installed on records, and usually left on permanently. The gadget consisted of several plastic arms radiating from a center containing the hole; the multiple arms' resemblence to spider legs is the source of the nickname 'spider.'
