middlesex school
a preppy prep school in concord massachusetts where rich kids pretend they're not rich and poor kids pretend they're rich. alot of drug use and alot of joking about being gay, which 60% of the school most likely is. 90% of the school owns ralph lauren polo shirts in at least 6 colors. the person wearing the brightest colors wins 'best dressed'.
