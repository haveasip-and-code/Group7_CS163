David Sedaris
David Sedaris the author of such works as ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and HOLIDAYS ON ICE. His wit, self-deprecating humor and mockery of social conventions are but the few delightful treats you'll find in his work. The true heart of Sedaris seeps through in his oddly endearing tales of self, family and loves. Sedaris is quite possibly one of the greatest writers of our time.
