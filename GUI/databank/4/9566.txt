rastafarianism
but controversial part of the movement's religious practice is the smoking of ganga, or marijuana, as a sacrament to achieve spiritual enlightenment. The physical appearance of Rastafarians is distinguished by uncombed, coiled hair known as dreadlocks, which symbolizes the mane of the Lion of Judah (one of Haile Selassie's titles), and the wearing of red, black, green, and gold. Most Rastafarians follow special diets and many are vegetarians.
