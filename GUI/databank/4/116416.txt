Grand Prix GTP
The usual compromise that is made when a husband (who wants a sports car) and a wife (who wants a grocery getter) buy a car together. It's a good looking car, and decently fast-certainly faster than 90% of the stuff she could have goaded you into buying if she loved you less-but contrary to what people will tell you, it will never outperform a pony car, and even a V6 Mustang will eat it for lunch.
