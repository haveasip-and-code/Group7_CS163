Dudley Boyz
A large wrestling group that originated in Extreme Championship Wrestling. Supposedly a gimmick created by wrestler Raven, the Dudleys were children of fabled wrestler Big Daddy Dudley and all of the ring rats he had slept with in different cities. Eventually Buh Buh Ray, D-Von and Spike made their way to World Wrestling Entertainment while the other 'brothers' faded away. ; The three Dudleys continued in WWE for years until being released in the summer of 2005. Due to WWE copyrighting the gimmick, neither Bubba Ray (as he was renamed in WWE), D-Von or Spike were allowed to continue use of the names. ; See [Team 3D].
