Durem
Durem is a town on the [GaiaOnline] map. It has two shops, owned by two [NPC]'s Edmund and Moiria. In Edmund shop, you can by more suave and upper-class items for your Gaian avatar, while at Moiria's, you can buy items that show how independent and rebel your avatar is. There is also a Hair Salon, where a busty NPC by the name of Vanessa will change your avatar's hair style. ; The VonHelsons, two twin NPC's, hosted the The Second Gaian Anniversary Ball at their mansion, located in Durem. This was a major plot change, because it used to be hosted by Gambino, at his manion on the Isle De Gambino.
