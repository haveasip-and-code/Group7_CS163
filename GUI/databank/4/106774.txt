Junior High
Where the worms feast on the flesh of of the already matured. Junior High is the three year stage of life between being a child and being a teenager. During this period, individuals will feast on pop culture, forming cliques and making friends that will last a lifetime. The majority of those who attend junior high, commonly known as preps, are very immature, and leave emotional scars on the remaining individuals. Somehow, after the three years have passed, these immature individuals will have changed magically into likeable and mature human beings.
