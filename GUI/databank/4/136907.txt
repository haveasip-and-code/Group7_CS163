I live 3 minutes from this town. I go to school in this town. Here is my definition: ; A town where you are labled into three categories: A freak, a [fag], or, yes, alot people dress like [wiggers]. Most people here are [emo] and [punk] fags who do nothing but listen to [Taking Back Sunday], or are total wiggers, and listen to nothing but rap.
