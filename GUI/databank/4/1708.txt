George W. Bush
1. Most popular person for unmotivated Americans who don't understand politics to blame their problems on. ; 2. Waived being politcally correct by commiting the horrible act of liberating millions of Iraqi's from a malicious dictator and actually doing something to avenge the 9/11 attacks. ; 3. Hated for doing all that is in his power to protect the American people ; 4. Only reason people don't talk about what an ass Bill Clinton was. Good choice democratic party, nominate the horny co-worker. ; 5. A little on the dumb side.
