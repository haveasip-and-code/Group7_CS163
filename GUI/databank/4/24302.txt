Dead or Alive
DOA is a series of fighting games. DOA1 was made using Virtua Fighter engine, the Saturn version of DOA1 is better than the Playstation version, which has no backdrops. ; DOA2 is the best of the series. ; DOA Volleyball is actually quite a subversive game; how many games can make boys interested in what girls wear? ; It has shown many males why girls are so picky with clothes! And there are many females who are not offended by it at all, and happily play the game. ; Of the DOA girls, the adorable Hitomi is in my view the prettiest, because she looks like a real girl. ; If anything, the game is sexist against men; the male characters are reduced to a supporting role, and are rather dull.
