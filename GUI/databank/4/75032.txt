Ate up
The hangover period after coming down off of the club drug [ecstasy]. There is debate as to when exactly the ate up period starts, but generally it happens right after the first short sleep period after coming down. ; This state is characterized by an overall 'fuzzy' head feeling as if your skull was filled to the brim with a mass of wet cotton balls. Mild headache is also common along with general stiffness and muscle/joint aches if one was dancing for long periods of time. Users who frequent clubs during intoxication also frequently get 'beat' after effects, hearing snippets and pieces of the music they were listening to during the peak time of the high. ; Origins of the term are unclear, but in the [EDM] scene, strong evidence points towards either the state of Florida or Texas coining the term, with Florida the more probable place (8up.com is a storied rave/party website for Central and South Florida).
