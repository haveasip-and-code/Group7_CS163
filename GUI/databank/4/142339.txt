hallowed be thy name
The best metal song ever, originally written and performed by one of the most important bands in heavy metal, [Iron Maiden]. It was also covered on the bonus disc of Cruelty and the Beast by [Cradle of Filth], but nothing can ever top Hallowed be thy name from Iron Maiden as the best song EVER.
