Yankees
The greatest professional sporting team in the history of the known world. Winner of 26 World Series championship and 39 American league pennants. Members include such legends as babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Lou Gherig, Joe DiMaggio, Roger Maris, Yogi Bera, Whitey Ford, Reggie Jackson, Don Mattingly, and Wade Boggs. Yankee Stadium, also known as 'The House That Ruth Built' is situated in the Bronx in the greatest city in the world: New York. The Yankees' chief rival is the Boston Red Sox, whom after winning one championship in 86 years, have suddenly come under the delusion that they are a greater team than the Yankees. 1 in 86 is pathetic and no cause for boasting in such a sad city as Beantown.In short, G-d created the New York Yankees on the Sixth day at twilight.
