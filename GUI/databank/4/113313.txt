emma willard
A woman in the 1800's who started the first all girls school in 1814. Now in Troy, New York, Emma Willard School is a lovely place where girls (who board) have no access to the outside world for nine months of the year and only have the RPI frat houses across the street for guys (but that doesn't even count). The only thing good about the school are the kitchen guys, but they all have girlfriends.
