UO
UO is a PC game, short for Ultima Online. It first came about around the end of September to early October of 1997, and is still running today. It was originally 2D, but now had spread to 3D, and has around 250,000 players from all over the world. The setting is, in my opinion, semi-Renaissance, with mages and magical spells, dragons, 'recalling', which is casting a spell to get from one place to another, house ownership, items, weapons, monsters, and unlimited possibilities. You can talk to people, form hunting parties, even guilds and communities. Unfortunately, the game has been a bit nerfed for years, and ever since Age of Shadows, an expansion pack, the game isn't what it used to be. But the game is always changing, and can still be great fun.
