QUIZILLA
An absolutely amazing website. Once a really cool place to hang out, and home to some fun, entertaining quizzes, it has now fallen into fanfiction hell. If you load the site's Top Rated list, you'll get something to the effect of 'A date with Harry Potter, volume 181' and/or 'LeStat and You Vol. 8: THE LEMON!' ; However, not all of Quizilla is bad. Behind the cliche romances, the porn, and the bad Anne Rice fanfiction, there are some really good quizzes. 'Claim Your Wings' and 'What Color is Your Heart?' are two great ones, but there are countless others. ; The other great part about Quizilla is the people. The site is based in Salt Lake City, the home of its sweet, witty owner, who works his ass off on a daily basis. The users, for the most part, are awesome people as well. Chaoscomesatnite, Freyja525, SarahLyn, and Shattered-Sorrow are awesome people, as are the other people who make actual quizzes, not just those terrible romances and porn. (Although the romance writers are the perkiest, kindest people you'll ever meet.) ; All in all, Quizilla is definitely worth a visit, despite the awful downtime.
