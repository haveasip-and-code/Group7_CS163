the best friend u could ever have. A person you can talk to and share your deepest thoughts and feelings with. Not only your best friend but someone you love. Someone you love more than nething you could ever explain. They listen you you and understand you. They help you and heal you. The laugh and cry with you. They will always be there for you. They love you just as much as u love them and they always will.
