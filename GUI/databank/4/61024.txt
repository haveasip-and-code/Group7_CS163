PEAKING
the result of ingesting copious amounts of MDMA.Deffinately the more social of drugs , MDMA can make the most shy annoying people seem interesting.. ofcourse only to other people peaking.Effects include a sensation of 'floating' , as though you weigh nothing and your legs seem to glide rather than stride.Thus being able to dance hours on end.Everyone talks to you and you talk to anyone about anything and somehow it all seems to be the most indepth conversation about cornflakes you have ever had and it is sure to change the rest of your life
