House of Boxer
A residence soley comprised of the male sex, usually dressed in boxers of questionable cleanliness. Members of the residence often hold worringly biggoted views towards a wide range of issues, especially regarding women, (known by the terms: birdage, pussy, bitches, cum buckets...) When women are encountered in the residence they are either members of environmental health or members' bitches. They are usually utilised for the purposes of cooking, cleaning and sexual gratification. All in all a well rounded establishment. Indeed!
