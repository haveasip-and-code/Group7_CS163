Goth
A fascination with death and the morbid. The style of goth, which some goths may or may not wear, often includes black hair, pale skin, large quantities of metal jewelry, piercings, etc. ; Some goths may be considered [poser]s for they dress in the gothic style in order to gain attention and to be 'different.' The irony in this lies that they are all different, and thus all the same.
