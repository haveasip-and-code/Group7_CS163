'how do you know she is a witch' ; 'She looks like one' ; 'I'm not a witch! I'M not a witch! They dressed me up like this and this isn't my nose it's a false one.' ; 'I see. Eh.. Did you dress her up like this?' ; 'Well, nose a bit. Yeah a bit.' ; 'Tell me. What do you do with witches?' ; 'Burn them! Burn!' ; 'And then why do witches burn. Hmmm..' ; 'Because they're, made of wood?' ; 'So how do you tell if she is made of wood?' ; 'Eh.. Build a bridge out of 'er' ; 'But can not you also build bridges out of stone?' ; 'Oh yeah' ; 'Does wood sink in water?' ; 'No no it floats. Throw her into the pond!' ; 'Wait! What also floats in water?' ; 'Umm.. very small rocks. churches. lead!' ; 'A duck' ; 'presicly!' ; 'So logically..' ; 'If she weighs the same as a duck, then shes made outta wood.' ; 'And therefore' ; 'She's a witch!'
