Delmonte
The toughest kid , besides baby salmi and kohut. Hes basically jacked and destroys anyone or anything that gets in his way. His family, especially his mother, is very nice. He walks around like a hardass but really runs a 14 minute mile, so if u wanna race him don't, ull get burned. He takes bitch shots at people and throws people but will never fight anyone. Basically, his muscles compare to those on snoop dogg.
