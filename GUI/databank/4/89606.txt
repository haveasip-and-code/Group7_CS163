haymarket
Haymarket is a little town thats barely big enough to live in. Even though developments near by have the same zip code, they are actully not in Haymarket. Anyone who wasn't born there, hates to live there. No one lives in Haymarket all their lives. And if there was someone who did, they'd have children with their sister/brother or mother/father and wouldn't know that there was a world outside of those 3 blocks.
