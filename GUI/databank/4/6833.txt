krav maga
Krav Maga isn't recognized as a true 'martial art', because it teaches techniques that are 'dishonorable' and/or couldn't be used in a fighting ring without really hurting the opponent. It's more like Israeli street fighting. ; But it's really powerful and practical in real fights, teaches you where to strike to inflict the most damage, how to disarm opponents, get out of bear hugs/choke holds etc. ; And it's not just in LA anymore, there are training centers all over the US now
