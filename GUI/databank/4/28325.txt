kniff
Steve Allen once called some guy a knif (fink spelled backwards).he was sued and the judge threw the guy out of his court and told him to go find a sense of humour if he could find as he was badly in need of one. ; As Steve Allen pronounced it sounded more like : ke-niff, I think he deliberately yiddished it.
