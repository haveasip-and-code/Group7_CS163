Hacker
Seen at the top of the [technological heirarchy], a person fully capable of using a computer to the fullest extent, and knows at least three programming languages without having to refer back to a tutorial, and has done at least one recognizable thing with them. ; Not to be confused with [cracker]. While a hacker may have the capacity to gain unauthorized access to a computer, he/she will only do it to expand the boundaries of knowledge and promote virtue, while a cracker will destroy the results of a hacker. ; It is unorthodox to consider yourself to be a hacker, rather than be considered a hacker by other hackers.
