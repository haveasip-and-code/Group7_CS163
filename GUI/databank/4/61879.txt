Clarita
From the little Filipina Clarita of Gubat. The word is Latin derived which means little Clara. Clara is derived from the Medieval name derived from Latin clarus 'clear, bright, famous'. Saint Clare, a follower of Saint Francis of Assisi, left her wealthy family to found the order of nuns known as the Poor Clares. This is also the name of an Irish county which was named for the Norman invader Richard de Clare (known as Strongbow), whose surname is derived from an English river.
