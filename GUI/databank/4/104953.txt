A Series of Unfortunate Events
- The Neutral Side - ; A series of books. There's approximately 12 of them, thinks I. ; - The Good Side - ; Only thing I can think of is that we got a Jim Carrey movie out of it. ; - The Bad Side - ; Boring, bland, shitty, dreary, read only by goths and emos, written by a man with a sexual etish involving having his real name hidden from the public, and not even playing himself in the movie of his first three books.
