cad and bounder
This phrase is worth noting precisely because it does not belong in this dictionary: it makes sense in a moral universe that has utterly vanished. The last 'cad and bounder' died, perhaps, about 1947 (see London Daily Telegraph obituaries for further evidence). ; Although they are appropriately linked, the precise meanings differ. A 'cad' is one who does harm to a woman's honor or sense of self-worth as, for example, by taking her for a garden walk when he has no intention of marrying her. A 'bounder' is a presumptious upstart, seemingly ignorant of, but perhaps merely indifferent to, fundamental norms of propriety.
