Brawl Hall
n. An increasingly well-known online hangout for some pretty fucked up forum whores, trolls, and degenerates of all shapes, sizes, and prejudices. One of the original websites solely dedicated to the 'art' of insulting people online, otherwise known as [flaming], as well as [trolling]. ; Formed around the turn of the century in an IRC-based chat room with a handful of loyal members, Brawl Hall now receives tens of thousands of hits per day and a not inconsiderable portion of said hits come from the BH forum's 20,000 + members. ; The rules are simple. Insult one another through whichever means possible, including borderline-private information, spamming other forums in the name of Brawl Hall until their servers explode and the 'enemy' is forced to post at the BH forums, troll members into posting at the BH forums, and otherwise act as an offensive, immature twat who barfs out such inanity as '[airclaim]' (meaning something that cannot be proven), '[PKB]' (short for Pot calling the Kettle Black), and the ever-annoying and idiotic '[backpedal]', (defined as when a user changes/attempts to change their story after the fact). ; There have been accusations that Brawl Hall hacks members, though nothing conclusive has been provided, only angry forum members that claim this is true. Overall, a popular but embarrassing hole in the internet full of human filth that get off on hurting others, that unfortunately, will not see a decrease in controversy anytime soon.
