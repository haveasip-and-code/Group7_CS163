crowd surfing
When you are at a rock concert in a tight audience and the people around you lift you up onto the heads of the crowd around you. Then either all the people holding you up slowly pass you around or they all at once throw you to another section of the crowd. Usually the ride ends with security pulling you down and then you have to go to the back of the crowd and work your way back up to where you started from. Or the people you are passed to do not know you are coming and end up dropping you. The feeling when you are crowd surfing is as if you are simply floating up there. Even though there are about 10 hands touching your legs, ass, back, and sometimes head.
