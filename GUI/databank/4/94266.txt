Nazareth Academy Preparatory School
A Prep School in Northeast Philly filled with the ghettoest fabulous of girls to the richest of girls. Sporting a sexy one piece-jumper, hot knee socks, and ridiculously good looking sattle shoes as their signature outfit, these girls come from all over Philadelphia, from the city to the suburbs. Commonly referred to as, 'NAZ,' with the badass mascot of a fighting panda, we top those Villa girls... I mean what kind of mascot is a GEM? Run by orthodox nuns, who do not have any ankles, Nazareth truly earns it spot as being a 'Northeast' school. E-A-G-L-E-S
