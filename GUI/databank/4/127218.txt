hobbitch
hobbitch /HAW - bich/ n. (pl. hobbitches) ; 1. a short, evil-mannered female who sustains her life by destroying the happiness of others and converting it into sexual pleasure. ; 2. a bitch that resembles a hobbit. ; 3. any short filipino woman who takes pleasure in emasculating men and collecting shiny objects, especially those that can be jammed into the drive of a PS2. ; 4. any short woman named Roxanne. ; NOTE: I created this word myself: it is the bastard child of the words [hobbit] (from the Lord of the Rings -- short, furry humanoids with big feet and a love of weed) and [bitch](a short, furry human with big feet and a trendy 'love' for weed to impress people) ; also see: [succubus]
