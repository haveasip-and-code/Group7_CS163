Microsoftize
A global or transnational corporation that desires/attempts to monopolize the global market, outsource valuable jobs to economically lesser developed regions/countries, and obliterate competitors within the same business sector. The prefix 'micro-' is misleading, as Microsoft is not by any means a small corporation.
