Model Minority
A myth that claims that Asian Americans are all smart, quite, assimilated and get by without any help. It ignores all the bad in Asian American communites and creates a false ideology. It was created in the 1960s to stop the civil rights movement by claiming that Asian Americans get by on their own.
