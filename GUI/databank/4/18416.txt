The Mond
People who refer to Richmond, Va as 'the mond' are destined to become either housewives or country club members, since the definition implies that the speaker is a spoiled rich kid who will have everything handed to them. People who enjoy 'the mond' do not frequently go into the REAL Richmond (a.k.a. not the west end) and thus don't realize what a hellhole of a place it really is. Richmond sucks and you should be happy to not live there.
