gynophobe
1) one who is afraid of women. (this may mutate into outright misogyny if left untreated. An excellent remedy is for a considerate, reasonably sexy, sexually enthusiastic woman to fuck the gynophobe's brains out.) ; 2) a repressed woman afraid of her own vulva and/or sexuality. ; 3) an otherwise straight man who is too much of a pussy to perform cunnilingus. ; See also: [nice guy], [prude], [double standard], [Republican], [gangsta].
