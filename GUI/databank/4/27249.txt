The Brownie Diet
A diet that encourages the person on it to bake and consume nothing but brownies. Morning, noon, and night. Apparently, some world renowned chef on The Food Network mentioned this was the diet that helped Oprah lose weight, and keep it off, and thus, launched this obscure and disgusting diet into unrelenting popularity amongst bitter, resentful, chocolate obsessed fat chicks, who are just too lazy to try and lose weight the old fashion way: with exercise, and a normal, healthy diet.
