gothic girls
12-18 year old girls who dress in black clothes from target and famous barr and studdes leather stuff from hot topic, write sucky suicidal poetry in their ringbooks and decorate this with turned around pentagrams, are totally into vampires, self-mutilation and death, plaster their walls with luis royo posters and think they are so deep and different from all the other pubescent, angsty teenagers. all just because they think ville valo from HIM is sooooo cute.
