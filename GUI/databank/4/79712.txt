nintendo
Kick ass videogame company. Saved the industry in the 1980s, went downhill since, yet still are more profitable than any other videogame company (Yes, they make more $ than Sony does, because they actually make their own games. Today many jerkoffs knock Nintendo citing that their games are 'kiddy' These are the same kinds of idiots that buy the Playboy videogame and think they're cool and mature because they only play games with blood and guts. A videogame is good if it is fun, and Nintendo doesn't need to rely on shock value, a la GTA, to make good games.
