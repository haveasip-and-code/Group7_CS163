run-and-hug
Occurs mostly with teenage girls who haven't seen eachother in about four days or more. They see eachother, and immediately approach eachother quickly yelling some sort of phrase that exhibits frantic glee, such as 'Oh my God!'. Te run and hug eachother, embracing sometimes as long as enough time to have an entire conversation.
