st. pierre bomb
This word is quite common in Boston, I have also heard it in South Eastern Ohio. ; The definition I would say is slightly different than what is listed. Normally the person denying the source of the St. Pierre Bomb is someone other than the one who took the dump. ; It is usually the bomber's good friend, spouse etc.
