Breaking Benjamin
a group of deliquints sent to a correctional facility for the senseless murder of a young african-american man, Fareek Benjamin. Some say that the method of murder used was so distressing, these men 'broke' benjamin. However, in order to remember such a legacy, we call them such in the present tense.
