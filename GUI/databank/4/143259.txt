Adolf Hitler (Herr Fuhrer)
The Leader of The German Worker's Party which later became the National Socialist, or Nazi, Party. Wrote an autobiography entitled 'Mein Kampf' (or My Struggle/Battle) describing his national extremist point of view and intense hatred of Jews and the 'Jewry', which they brought about. A man 'mit grosse Probleme und kleiner Mast,' as his close commrades Rommell, Hess, and Himmler often quipped in the midst of the second World War. In 1944, after losing ground in Sicily and the Italian mainland, he realized that his pointless war to prove that Deutschland truly was 'uber alles' would most likely falter. In 1945, he blew his fucking brains out because he finally realized that his mind was his own worst enemy.
