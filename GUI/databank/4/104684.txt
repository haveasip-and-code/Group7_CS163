It is characterized by the shuffling around one's house or dorm for many hours in search of meaningless activities with unnaturally short durations (e.g. getting a drink of water or eating chocolates every five minutes, watching the television, listening to music, or playing a game all for five minutes yet in ten minute intervals). Such behavior is caused by the ever-present threat of doing work and the fear that committment to any other activity might preclude one from performing the said assignment or studying. All actions are results of cognitive processes which derive from a mild form of schizophrenia.
