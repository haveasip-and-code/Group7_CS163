which's
A synonym to [of which] and likewise an inanimate alternative to [whose], the possessive of [who]. Whereas 'whose' is defined to be the possessive of both 'who' and 'which', there is a hesitation to use 'whose' with an inanimate antecedent, and so the word 'which's' is beginning to be used instead.
