Jersey Devil
The comical creature who looks in people's windows at night, and causes havic with piercing screams. Only the coolest paranormal being ever. He has wings, four legs, glowing red eyes and is said to look like a cross between a kanagroo, dog, bat and dragon. There have been many sightings, but the most recorded in a short time was during the week of January 16-23, 1909. Tracks leading to no where, bloody chickens and hellish screams are said to come from him. Many are scared of him but some accounts are quite humorous; one says that he 'did a little jig on the fence and flew off;' another says he sits by the water and waits for sinking ships to laugh at. It's said that he was the 13th child of Mrs. Leeds, who lived in the Pine Barrens forest. It was stormy outside that night and when she went into labor she screamed 'let this be a devil!' and the child transformed into a being with wings and a tail and flew out of the chimney. When something goes wrong, like a calf is missing or if there's a bad drought, some blame the little devil. He still haunts the woods to this very day...
