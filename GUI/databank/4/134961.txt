drunk catcher
An obstacle found in one's path that, while drunk, provides an incredible challenge to avoid. This includes cracks in the sidewalk, low-hanging tree branches, abnormal curbs, and members of the opposite sex who are of questionable attractiveness. Generally, these are ranked by class, or degree of difficulty: class 1 being the lowest and class 5 being the highest.
