Gee
A man-boy (usually male but not exclusively) who addresses his friends 'Alright Gee' as if he were stepping out of his Bentley onto a hot South Central sidewalk with his gang member entourage after signing a huge Hip-hop recording contract instead of actually getting off his older brother's hand-me-down bicycle to go into a very provisonal UK/European convenience store to buy some more cigarettes for his mum in the rain. Must have thick local accent which almost inevitably makes his 'Rap' sound even more ludikrus..
