cabbage squirrel
Those stupid little spider-like things in Halo2 that zombify everything after you kill them. Named for two reasons; 1] The sudden rush of adrenaline one gets as the these horrid things comes flying off the wall can only be compared with the adrenaline rush one gets from chasing a squirrel and, 2] You can only imagine that after killing them and stomping on them in your high-tech Spartan suit, the smell would be something kin to rotting cabbage.
