emo cuts
Small, inconsequential cuts, or the scars left from them, that the more dedicated emos adorn their arms with so as to encourage others to pity them and agree that their life is as bad as they say. Kids with these aren't suicidal, only attention-seeking, if not status-seeking. A pathetic 'hobby'/'accessory' and major insult to the people that really do feel they have no way out and need to end their own life.
