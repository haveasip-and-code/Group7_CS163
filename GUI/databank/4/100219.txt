roadkill
A honourary title given to the ugliest girl in school. In particular areas, there may only be one roadkill per two or even three schools. ; If any possible contenders rise up through the ranks from primary school, a fight to the death should be initiated. The winner gets to be continually mocked and jeered for mother nature's cruel joke vis-a-vis their face. ; When she leaves school, her real name (if it can be remembered) can be used again, and a new roadkill instated in her place, with possible capes and crowns - but, to be honest, most people [CBA] and just want to get down to the jeering.
