punkyfish
A punk style outward label clothing consisting as many zips, bittons, safety pins and rips/slits that they can get away with. Girls who beleive themselves rebellious or different don't tend to shop here, contrary to popular beleif. ; Usual customers are pre-teens trying to look tarty, middle aged women trying to look young, or small framed chinese/japenese girls in their 20's and 30's who can totally get away with wearing these clothes due to their petite figures. ; The tight jeans are really bum-hugging, so look good on anyone with a tight arse. i.e. slim girls, emo boys.
