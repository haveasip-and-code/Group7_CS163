samurai
A social class of people started in the latter 13th century who usually started training at dojos when they were eight or nine. After graduating from these dojos they usually joined the military ruled by the Shogunate or [Shogun]after the Sengoku war when the Shogun became the supreme power more samurai came to the scene and joined the Shougnate however these samurai became dogs of the Shogun thus leading to small rebel groups trying to oppose the Shogun, but none were sucessful until the bakumatsu war began. Some samurai rebuked their title and became [rurouni]. Samurai disappeared after the Meji era. Today many manga artists over-glorify the samurai as cool, good-hearted people but in actuallity most samurai were cold-blooded killers
