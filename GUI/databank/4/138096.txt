tomboy
A young girl who would rather be playing football in the rain than out shopping and boy hunting. Hangs out with boys. Does not care about what other people think of her, nor does she judge others for the way they are. Very sporty, and does not follow the latest fashion trends. Does not make fun of what most people would call ' nerds ' or ' geeks ', and in fact befriends them most of the time. I am a tomboy, and I love it.
