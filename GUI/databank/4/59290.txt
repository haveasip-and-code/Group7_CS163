prom date
When a 45 year old [mullet] wielding, fake-tan having, sunglass wearing, super dyke-type female calls your bat phone talking about going out together to get beers and then saying 'whatever happens, happens' which ultimately gives you free reign to the [merkin] covered beefy curtain. This isn't just a regular date, it is the most special of dates and that being a prom date.
