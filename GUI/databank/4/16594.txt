solid
Cannabis resin looks like a dung ball or comressed brown stuff. The 'Solid' can be heated and the smoke given off is directly breathed in this is now as 'Hot Rocking' (Rock another term for Solid). If it is lightly heated it can be crumbled and mixed with tobacco to make a joint. For the best effect use a cheese grater to grind the 'Solid' into a power and add to a joint with tobacco.
