Fermat's Last Theorum
A pretentious and nerdy way of describing a girl who will not succumb to the woos of potential mates (i.e., no one can [have sex] with her). This term references 'Fermat's Last Theorum,' a mathematical conjecture that remained unproven for centuries. Only math geeks use this term.
