Darko
the 7' center on the detroit pistons who was takin 2nd overall in the 2003 NBA draft. Serbian-Montonegran decent. Amazing at life, has many worshippers that know he has potential and will succeed. Usually sits his ass on a bench all game, usually only takes a bank hook shot whenever he gets in a game which is rarely, and the ball goes in 50 percent of the time. Larry Brown is the reason he doesnt play because larry brown is racist against foreign players.
