Jamestown
9 by 1.5 island community located at the mouth of the narragansett bay in Rhode Island. Home of the socially elite, the kids here have there choice of schools and drugs.Drugs drugs drugs and drugs. most likely a field somewhere in the middle of the island that no body knows about. Typical saturday nights include doing drugs and sketchy walks down narragansett ave...where all the drunk people from the bar roam back and forth from xtra mart to the water. With only like 3 choices in places to party, potters (poison ivy capital of the world), eldred ave (soccer moms blow it up) and hulls cove (but too close to romanos crib). Jamestown will be the first to go in a mass flooding of the world. Awesome!
