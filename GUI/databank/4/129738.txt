hiyo
An exclamative(exclamatory) expression with roots to the Indian 'hiyo hiyo' chant. Was used in the Lone Rangers comics and shows. And now decades later was used in music and movies as well. Although the interpretation remains much the same, large numbers of people somehow associate it with greetings(which is false). ; It is used unecessarily and unsincerely these days due to most people's ignorance and failure to understand its history and true meaning.
