Calvin and Hobbes
Truly one of the best comic strips ever done, sadly it has been discontinued by its artist, Bill Watterson. Not only does the comic bring something of an amazing vocabulary to a medium usually lacking in that division, but it is also hilariously funny, and often times cute. ; The protagonist is Calvin, a six year old that enjoys torturing his teen-aged babysitter, and romping in the woods with his best friend, Hobbes. They have fun by holding top-secret GROSS meetings in their treehouse, and throwing various assortments of things at Susie, the focus of Calvin's frustration at times. ; The side-kick of sorts is Calvin's stuffed tiger, which, at least in his imagination, is a real tiger that likes tuna fish sandwhiches, and steals his covers in bed. Also loves to have his belly rubbed ; Basically, if you haven't read anything of the C and H variety, your life is lacking... ; n/v (a calvin and hobbes/ calvin and hobbesed) something ridiculous, and potentially dangerous. (aka backing a car out of the driveway and into the ditch, riding a flimsy wagon off the edge of a cliff, throwing ice/snow balls at girls)
