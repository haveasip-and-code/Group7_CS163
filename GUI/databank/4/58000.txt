Ingestore
One who ingests their own organic waste. Often accompanied by one or more [Soiler]s. ; Legend has it, there was an ancient rivalry between the [Soiler]s and Ingestores. The old Grecian myth tells of a man named Soilicles. Soilicles, Athenian Proto-Soiler, was the first of his kind. It is said that a day came when he was busying himself in the habitual age-old activity, when he was approached by a gentleman by the name of Ingesticles. Ingesticles, staring in disbelief and horror at what was to become of the organic waste, stated that the excretions could easily be re-ingested, instead of being laid to waist. Soiliclese, taking umbrage at the thought, dismissed the idea and drove wedge forever between the two schools of thought. ; Ingesticles supposedly then aggregated his own philisophical school to forward his belief. To this day, subscribers to this doctrine are known as 'Ingestores.' Furthermore, the phrase 'organic waste' has it's second word come as a consequence of the contention of Ingesticles.
