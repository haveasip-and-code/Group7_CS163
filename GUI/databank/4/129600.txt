Pulling an Ortiz
Pulling an Ortiz is the act of skipping either a break or lunch in favor of getting more work done. This phrase is only used if you are sure not to request overtime or any compensation for this extra work time, you do it out of the kindness of your heart, or rather the sense of accomplishment you get out of having done more for the company and customers. ; The ultimate 'Pulling an Ortiz' is when you come in to work on your day off just to check on your coworkers.
