conservitive
some one who stays trapped in traditional values. a politician who beileves in the idea that goverment should stay out of peoples lives and let the 'invisble hand' control the market.Most conservitives arent true to their roots though these days they often want to make racial policys and try and stop civil right movements when they shouldve just listen to Adam smith the founder of their idealogy and stay out of those things unless they are trying to help the civil right movement. ironiclay although theyve been racsists since the 60,s they were founded on a anti-slavery platform.Psycologists have determed people who think conservitiely arent that smart.
