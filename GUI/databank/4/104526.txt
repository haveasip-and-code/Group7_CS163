rhapsody
An Italian Epic Power/Symphonic Metal Band. Debut album was released in 1997 and is very original and very enjoyable. Major classical and neoclassical influences. Songs are complex, some are predictable but they have an impressive discography. A similar band is Luca Turilli who is of course the guitarist of Rhapsody.
