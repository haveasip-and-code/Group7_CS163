pokemon
an insane phenomenon of the '90s, trading cards,games, and TV show about hunting for cute little creatures to put them in this tiny ball. occasionally, they take them out of their ball, and make them fight against other creatures. if the pocketmonster wins the fight the owner is closer to becoming a pokemaster.
