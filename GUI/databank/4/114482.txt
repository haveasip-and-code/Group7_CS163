virtual laughter
When someone laughs in a virtual media, say the Internet (IRC, Forums, MSN, AIM, etc...), they are using a virtual laughter. How can people laugh virtually? Using a series of acronyms. ; Probably, the first way of virtually laughing was [LOL] (Laughing Out Loud). Because saying LOL all the time was a bit stupid, someone made up [LMAO] and [ROFL]. These two have opened a whole new way for virtually laughing, since lots of combinations can be made from these two, from [ROFLMAO] to the incredible l33t [ROFLLMAONHAHAANDWSTC]. ; Note: Whoever says this isn't really doing the things they say, probably they aren't even laughing at all! ; See also [ROFFLMFAOOLTTFM], [ROFFMGRUTA], [ROFFGMBSAO], [ROFCMAO], and even more...
