windows hippy
A person who uses Windows but should really be a Mac or Linux user. They use open-source programs such as GAIM and Firefox. In addition to that, they heavily customize Windows with programs such as Litestep and custom 'hacks' that do random things to Windows such as changing the color of the Windows Start button. ; Note that they do not write these custom 'hacks' or customizing programs because they are incapable of coding/hacking themselves. ; Sometimes these hippies can be found prancing around a Mac singing and dancing about how pretty/amazing it is.
