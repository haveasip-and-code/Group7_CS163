A fake ass rapper who lives in the UK and used to be the admin of a forum called 24-Seven, now he supposedly has a record deal. His CD, titled 'Every Dog Has His Day' is due on or around June 13, 2005. I talked to him on MSN and he got mad at me for 'calling him a fake,' because he's a self-centered asshole.
