colins
A skinhead haircut that has been allowed to grow to a shabby length, to the level where the hair is poking over the ears. It is the same length all over [in most places], leading to a general look of untidiness. ; First came from a boy called 'Lee Colins', a boy from a poor family who always got his head shaved every couple of months to cure his headlice infestation. However, in between cuts it would grow to shabby proportions, and his foul attitude has led for this insult to be his legacy.
