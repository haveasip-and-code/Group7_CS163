gothserved
To be served by a goth. Served means being beaten (or owned.) It is a reference to the episode of South Park which mocked the movie 'You Got Served!' ; One of the goth kids says, 'I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform to the rest of you.' He joins the dance team. In response, another goth kid says, 'We just got gothserved.'
