theorycraft
Theorycraft refers to any game strategy that exists only in theory and never actually put into action. ; 'Theorycraft' originated from the PC game Starcraft. The term was coined after countless new players would argue with each other about how certain strategies were superior to other strategies without actually putting any of these concepts into practice. This later evolved into a game in itself, albeit sarcastically. From Starcraft to Theorycraft.
