cap guy
A type of person -- typically but not always in CAP -- who exagerates in order to boost self esteem. Cap guys suffer from too weed and alcohol in their lives. And attempt to compensate by being annoying, (see dip shit), they swear that they are really funny, but it turns out they're REALLY not, trust me. ; And although most Cap guys will occasionally make us laugh, they often cross the line of being funny to being racist and never seem to notice, but it doesn't actually matter because there are only like 10 minorities in Cap anyway. ; Most Cap guys own at least one item from American eagle outfitters and have been known to pop their collars. They don't date outside of Cap, and become all moody when the girl of their dreams sees them as 'just a friend'--and to that we say get over it. ; Although most Cap guys have some redeeming qualities, there are a few who we will see in 10 years, still living in their parent's basement, smoking copious amount of weed and still trying to decipher James Joyce.
