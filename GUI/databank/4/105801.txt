Conan the Barbarian
The hero of a series of short stories, novellas and one novel by pulp fiction author Robert E. Howard (1906-1936). Conan is a wandering swordsman whose travels take him into improbable adventures with scheming wizards and lusty wenches. The stories take place on Earth, in pre-Atlantean times. These stories pretty much gave birth to the term [sword and sorcery] for a certain kind of fantasy tale. Learn more about Howard at rehoward.com.
