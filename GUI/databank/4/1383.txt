macedonia
There is no such country as Macedonia, everybody, who has some knowldge of history, knows that it is an artificially created country and that all Macedonians are pure Bugarians, because Macedonia has always been Bulgarian land. By the way, Samuel IS a BULGARIAN tzar and has nothing to do with that invented country.
