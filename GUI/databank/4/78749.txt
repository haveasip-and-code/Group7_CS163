jeje
Question: What is, why is it called and how do you defind a 'jeje'? ; Answer: jeje is the derrogative term used for a certain categorised kind of people, mostly with the origin/roots from Spain or Venezuela. ; In their language the letter j isn't pronounced as we know. Their j sounds more like our h with a presound of a person that has got something stuck in his/her throuht, hence they type jejeje or jajaja when they want to express laughing in written words, which happen more than often. This is why we call them jejes. ; Another sign that it is a jeje you are dealing with is that he (they are most commonly masciulin) seems to have low intelligence. This is because 1. they can not express themselves in the English language as good as an average person 2. it seems that their kind is simply dumber. ; A jeje is also easy to recognice just by looking at it's name. Names written in caps, all letters big or all small, or even beginning with a small letter buy then continiues with big ones. Their names are also often begun with 'El' then followed with a random spanish or portuguese word. ; The jejes behaviour patterns are relativley easy to defind aswell. ; A jeje is mostly seen near the areas of Britain farmlands and along the mountain where the Ettin caves are. If one is seen alone the place is soon filled with others in order to get enough power to fight you. If you fight one near a guardline, expect the jeje to seek comfort within it if you are not able to follow. Other ways to escape a certain death is to houselog in one of the countless numbers of jeje-houses. ; As for most things there are exeptions, but in this case too few. ; Another fact is that Eltharion is not ajeje, but a nice English guy. If you have additions/corrections you whould like me to do, please post them in this topic.
