80's man
A man generally in his 30's with an inferiority complex. Can be found driving rusted, or freshly primered, bad running, IROCs or Cameros wearing ripped up stone washed jeans, a sleeveless shirt (most likely stained and/or sporting a butt rock logo), a grease stained NASCAR hat, sporting a 10/90, challenging you to races. If not found in the driver's seat, this specimen will have a IROC or Camero on blocks in his front lawn next to the pile of PBR cans.
