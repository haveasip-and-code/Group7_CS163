snakes on a plane
An idiom which states an increasing amount of danger or tension, similar to 'the shit's hitting the fan' only much more terrible and apocalyptic. The phrase is partly ironic, as if to exaggerate the rather mild (though hilarious) premise of the 'Snakes on a Plane' movie starring Samuel L Jackson, which has snakes on a plane.
