linoob
Linoob was first conceived as a word in [#bit-tech] (quakenet) by one of the local nutties while talking about a person who is constantly asking questions about Linux while he could find the answers easily through a searchmachine. ; Linoob is actually a concatenation of '[Linux]' and '[noob]'. It means a person who is a beginner in Linux.
