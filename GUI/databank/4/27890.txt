bush bashing
The just and reasonable critisism of the unelected 'president' for reasons which are also relevant. Included are a number of equally true allegations such as: ; 1.) that he resembeles a chimp ; 2.) that he is a retard ; 3.) That he should keep church and state separate and stop fucking around ; 4.) That he choked on a pretzel (I mean, he choked on a fucking pretzel, dear God!) ; 5.)That he is a mindless thrall of corporate interests. ; 6.)and let us not forget, that he got out of vietnam, was given a college education, and was given a firm footing in politics due entirely to his fathers influence, as well as his own pathetic maleability.
