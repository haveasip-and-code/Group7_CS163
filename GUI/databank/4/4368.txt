Blind Guardian
Cool Power Metal band. Probably one of the most talented in musicianship and songwriting, up there with Helloween. Not so great but still excellent power metal bands are Iced Earth, Manowar, Rhapsody. Power Metal bands usually write songs which are Fantasy,Folk Lore, and Historic Based songs.
