Energy Dome
A hat that captures escaping brainwaves and recirculates them for maximum mental efficiency. It's very important that you buy a cheap plastic hardhat liner, adjust it to your head size and affix it with duct tape or Super Glue to the inside of the Dome. This allows the Dome to 'float' just above the cranium and thus do its job. Unfortunately, sans hard hat liner, the recirculation of energy WILL NOT occur. ; Also known as the 'flowerpots' worn by [Devo].
