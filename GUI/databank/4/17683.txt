mount vernon
Really not more ghetto than Yonkers at all, a somewhat misunderstood place. It would be hard to argue that Mount Vernon is 'so bad' when in fact the part of the Bronx it borders is really not that bad at all. Someone try to tell me that 233rd St & Baychester Ave is the hardcore Bronx. It could probably pass for suburbia! Together the two areas pretty much look like a clone of the North Shore of Staten Island - a distant, jungle-like ghetto.
