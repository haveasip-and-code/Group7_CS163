trendsbian
A girl who, to gain attention of peers and males, pretends to be bisexual or homosexual. They usually express this acquired 'alternative' lifestyle loudly and publicly, so EVERYONE knows and can gawk at just how punk rawk they are. Trendbians will announce in large groups that they kissed a girl, only to bask in the attention. A trendsbian will only hold hands with or sexually express themselves with another girl in public, preferrably around young males.
