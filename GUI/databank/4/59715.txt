drums
An loud sounding instrument, that I play. Oh, and no, you don't have to be a guy looking for chicks to play. ; Thought it looks easy to play, it much harder than it looks. In order to play, you must move your hands, and feet to different speeds. ; You right foot(normally) hits a petal that hits the biggest drum, called the 'bass drum'. This drum is mainly the beat drum, very steady. ; Your left foot hits the cymbals whenever needed. Your hands then hit the other remaining drums. ; A drum wonderful, if somewhat expensive to buy thing. Meaning, a lot of the time, drummers are needed. ; They can also get you kicked out of apartments, so be careful.
