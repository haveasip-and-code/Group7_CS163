C'est la guerre
Usually said with a shrug of the shoulders, upturned palms, and a slight shake of the head 'C'est la guerre' is a nicely ironic phrase used as an excuse for anything which goes wrong, often due to incompetence (sometimes one's own) or cirmumstances beyond ones control. A less elegant phrase would be 'Hey, what can you do?'
