camels game
In this game you have to guess how many camels there are. ; It is very simple once you know how to work it out. But the whole point of it is to distract the other person from realising how. ; It consists of clicking and clapping, this is how you distract the person, the clicks and claps have NOTHING to do with how many camels there are. ; If I decided I wanted to have 5 camels, I would have a series of claps and clicks (the sequence can be of any length, it doens't matter) and then I would say: How many camels are there? ; 5 words, 5 camels. Simple huh? ; The number of camels you have, is the number of words you say after you've finished clicking and clapping.
