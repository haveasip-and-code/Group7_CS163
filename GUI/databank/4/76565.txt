Mighty the Armadillo
A character from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. Mighty is a hot-head and cocky young dillo, but has the power to back himself up. Be able to run nearly as fast as Sonic and being even stronger than Knuckles, Mighty is one tough customer who don't wanna piss off. However he is sometimes over-confident and rushes into things without thinking. ; My first debuted in the Sega Sonic Arcade game, where he, Sonic, and a little-known character named Ray the Squirrell conquered the evil Dr. Eggman's plans to build his robot empire(if you can find this rare arcade game anywhere in the world, consider yourself lucky, and play it dammit!). Mighty then later appeared in the game Knuckle's Chaotix for the Sega 32x. In this game he teamed up with Knuckles, Vector the Croc, Charmy Bee, and Espio the Chameleon and formed Team Chaotix. They then thwarted Eggman and his evil Metal Sonic with style. ; Afterward, Knuckles and Mighty went they're separate ways, while Vector, Espio, and Charmy stayed together as a team of crime-fighting detectives, and later appeared in Sonic Heroes without the good dillo. Mighty's current whereabouts in the series are unknown, but hopefuly that will changed. ; Many people consider Mighty to be no more than a 'Sonic re-color', mainly because his sprites in KC were actually editted Sonic sprites from the never-released game, Sonic Crackers. This is not the case, Mighty is more than a recolor, and definately has much potential to be a great character, and should be brought back into the series. Anyone who thinks otherwise shall be mauled. ; By ME.
