yarmite
Portmanteau term consiting of 'Yarm' and 'Socialite' - basically a wannabe who hangs out in the town of Yarm, near Middlesbrough, North East England ensuring everybody can see his or her latest pair of retro nike's and customised jeans. Also known to wear copious amounts of charity bands ('It's for charity! Me Nana died of cancer you know!'), and will obviously be wearing them in 6 months time when they aren't in fashion. Chyeeeeah right. ; Females are always covered in make-up and fake-tan, males have whatever haircut David Cunting Beckham has this week.
