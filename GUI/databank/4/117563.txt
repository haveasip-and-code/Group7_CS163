Space: Above and Beyond
A science-fiction/drama series created by James Wong and Glen Morgan, that lasted one season, and aired from 1995 to 1996. Follows a group of marine cadets as they form a military squadron called the 'Wildcards' and take on extremely dangerous. The 'main' character is Lt. Nathan West, who signed up because he wasn't allowed to go on a colonizing mission with his girlfriend Kylen Selina. Unfortunately, the craft Kylen was on was attacked by a race of unknown beings, who then come to be named 'Chigs'. In the final episode of the series, the Chigs struck a tentative peace treaty with the Earth government, but used a captured Chig to assassinate a group of high-ranking Earth delegates. The Wildcards managed to find the transport ship Kylen was being carried on, due to a trade agreement between the aliens and the Earth government, but the squadron were attacked by Chigs. In the end, two of the recruits were facing possible death as their escape pod drifted towards the surface of a planet, one recruit sacrificed himself to save the lives of everyone, and Nathan West finally found Kylen. In short, one of the greatest science-fiction shows ever.
