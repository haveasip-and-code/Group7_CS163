aformist
One who doesn't restrict themselves to known forms or patterns. Similar to a [nonconformist], an 'aformist' is defined by random behavior, stemming from a variety of perspectives and experiences. Aformists aren't typically anarchist by nature, but have from time to time shared the occasional similarity.
