An awesome place to go. Especially the Upper Main Line YMCA in Berwyn. They have an amazing swimming program. Lifelong friends are made. Has many different things to do. You could be going to swim practice while your mom goes to work out upstairs. They have summer camps you can go to and they also have daycare. it is a very sensible place to belong to.
