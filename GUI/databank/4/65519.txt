snooze off
A trend pioneered by Preston uni students (Dean Boyle and Luke Thomas) in the early 21st century that describes a time dedicated for catching up with sleep during the day. Snooze offs will often involve a small group of like-minded people confined to a dedicated snooze off room which is baking hot with drawn curtains.
