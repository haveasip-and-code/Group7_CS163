PussCake
A total Pussy, in every way possible. ; I did not coin this term, and for privacy's sake, I cannot name the guy who did. Well, at least the first person I heard say it, who, incidentally, is not the type to copy. Therefore I assume he coined the term. Anyway to the dude who said it first (initials ST): You rock!
