New Paltz
Located in the Hudson Valley of New York. Colorful, mountainous utopia of [hippies], D1 [ruggers], and an exceptionally good-looking university soccer team. The town that inspired Bob Dylan to pen 'All Along the Watchtower' and Paul Simon's ' Killer goes to College'. People play bongos at 4 am and the geese have phallus-shaped heads. There are an array of quaint boutiques and ethnic eateries in the downtown area.
