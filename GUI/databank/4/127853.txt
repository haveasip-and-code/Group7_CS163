Care Bears
Someone raised by the Noids, a cult dedicated to raising children with adult bears. Inspired by the insipid 1980's cartoon, 'The Care Bears', the cult thrives on the concept of returning man to nature with kindness and good will towards all. Children are taught to speak, but must learn to either survive or die at the hands of their Bear brethren. Few children survive, but those who do are often pillars in their community, combining their natural sense of survival with an animal like zeal for adventure, food and sex.
