Battle Rifle
A rifle that a soldier takes into battle. It is not officially called a battle rifle, however, as that is actually the name of one of the human weapons in the popular X-box game [Halo 2]. That is a very awesome game, by the way. ; Rifles have been used in military battles since the 1770s, but they were few in number, and only performed half as well as rifles in the mid-1800s. Battle rifles truly gained widespread use and acceptance during the [Civil War], when whole brigades and army divisions were armed with famous guns known as Springfields, Enfields, Sharps', Colts, Spencers, and Henry's. The last two mentioned were the first repeating-fire weapons, and led to further technological developments in the future.
