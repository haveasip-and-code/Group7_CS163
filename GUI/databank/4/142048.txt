starbum
A homeless individual that pays for a single Starbuck beverage or other item in order to loiter within the store, stay warm and use the bathroom facilities. Given the Seattle origins of Starbucks, local managers are discouraged from showing these individuals the exit. Unfortunately, the other patrons are often greeted with a foul stench when forced to sit next to one of these individuals in a crowded store. More prevalent in Boston and Portland than New York or Pittsburgh.
