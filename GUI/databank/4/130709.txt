moo-lay
A really cool and sophisticated way to say '[mullet],' since anything sounds more cool and sophisticated if you pronounce it as if it were French. It also allows you to encode your comment, in case you're overheard. ; It has nothing to do with fucking a cow, although there may be some correlation between having a mullet and having a desire to pork the beef. ; See also [low-zay]
