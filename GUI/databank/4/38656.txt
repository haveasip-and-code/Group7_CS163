Francisco Franco
n. Militaristic Fascist Spanish dictator from 1939 to 1975. ; He led the Nationalist side for most of the Spanish Civil war, against the Republican side, which comprised of [Communists] and [Anarchists]. Aided by forces sent by [Hitler] and [Mussolini], and by the backstabbing Communists, The [Nationalists] won the war in April of 1975. ; Franco's reign of terror was marked by oppression and routine disappearances. Political opponents were often executed, and the brutal [Guardia Civil] was omnipresent. ; To this day, Franco is remembered as the destroyer of inherant proof that an Anarchist society is possible. (The [Anarchists] managed to organize most of North Eastern Spain into efficient worker-controlled [collectives]. With the end of the Civil war, authoritanarianism was established.)
