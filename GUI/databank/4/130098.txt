sorority
House next to campus where usually cute rich chicks, mostly blond gals, live together (30 or more). They're not that much concerned about their academics...IQ often said to be low,...anyway, does this really matter? They are certain they'll find an even richer potential husband. Life's so easy...Their favorite expression is 'Oh my God !' (something like 80 times a day...)
