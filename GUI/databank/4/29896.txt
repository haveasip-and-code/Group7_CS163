wot r annotate
Used when someone says something (real life or internet) that does not make sense or is unintentionally silly. Similar to '[wtf]', but more specific. ; *Must* be 'wot r annotate' with NO capital letters, question marks or the like. Just 'wot r annotate'. That's it. Exclaimation marks may be used to emphasise the point one is trying to make. ; Originated by a girl who asked this very 'question' in response to a description of a school work task, including the need for annotation.
