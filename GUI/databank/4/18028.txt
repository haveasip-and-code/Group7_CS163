nigling
Nigling is a variation of the the word [Nigger]. The word Nigling, descibes the interactions of two Afro-carribean or similar males. Where the word [Nigger] that is used in conversation between two Afro-carribean or such like individuals (for example 'Yes my nigger'), Nigling is used in place of [Nigger], to allow for individuals under the age of 18 to participate in the conversation ritual, however the recipient of the word Nigling, has to be of 18 years or less, in order for this transaction to take effect, whereas reguardless of whether the provider of the word is either above or below the age of 18 they should use this word to a minor. (Do not use the word Nigling to any person over 18 years of age, this would cause extreme offence)
