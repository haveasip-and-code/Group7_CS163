Nick Valensi
A'ight, well, I'm not going to say he's sexy, because that's overplayed. He's extremely handsome. Anyway, he's got incredible talent at the guitar. Absolutely incredible. He's in a band called the Strokes who are, all put together, the number one best band in the history of music and the best band ever in the universe, to quote what somebody said already although not in quotes. In an interview for LAUNCH, he said that music is the Strokes's top priority, and it seems to be definitely his. I love Nick Valensi and need guitar lessons, as well.
