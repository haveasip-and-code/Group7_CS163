York University
York University is despised upon by other Toronto universities, such as the [University of Toronto] and [Ryerson]. It was once ranked #2 on Maxim's 'Sexiest Schools in North America' list. A lot of uptight, yet hot, girls attend this fine institution. Home of the rich and posh whose mommy and daddy buy their education. Known for programs such as the Schulich Business School and Osgoode Hall Law School (which I might add is the largest law school in Canada). It's Political Science program has received accolades and is considered one of the best in the country. Notoriously known for it's left-wing students and professors, and brawls between the Jews and Palestinians. ; All hail York!
