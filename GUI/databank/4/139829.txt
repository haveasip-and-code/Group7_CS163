Ramraid
British term. It all starts with the theft of a large vehicle, likely a truck (lorry in Brit parlance) or perhaps a van. Stolen vehicle is then driven through the plate glass window of a shop, perhaps a Best Buy (Dixon's). Selected shop is then raided for goodies by occupants of the vehicle, at which point thieves make off with the loot. Steal a truck, crash it into the shop and piss off with a bunch of junk in your arms and pockets. Ideal way to pass an evening or early morning. Popular activity with chavs when they run out of ciggies.
