bullis hockey
When I read that first definition, I couldnt help but laugh my ass off. Who won the IAC before u did? Landon did. The term 'All Iac kids wish they went to bullis' Bullis gets tooled by Landon and Prep in almost every sport, and yet, still want to talk trash. Anyone from another IAC school wouldnt lower themselves to go to Bullis. Bullis is and will always be the public school u pay for.
