level 60
The pinnacle of achievement, the absolute greatest accomplishment that one can recieve. Derived from World of Warcraft, where the level cap is level 60, and once you hit it it usually means you're pretty much done, the only other option being PvP, equip optimization, epic mounts, and high-level instances. Believe me, those AREN'T a lot of options. Play WoW, and you'll know what i'm talking about,
