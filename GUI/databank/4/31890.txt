polaroid
A brand name of cameras. Can print out pictures the moment you take the picture. Though it's been around for a long time, it wasn't popularized until 2 dudes named Big Boi and Andre (aka Outkast) used the name in their hit song 'Hey Ya'. Now, it's part of pop culture, and people will refer to shaking their things like a Polaroid picture.
