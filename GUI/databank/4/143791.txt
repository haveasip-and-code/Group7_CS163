Closer
Usually a Baseball team's best relief pitcher. He comes in for the last inning to 'shut the door' on the other team and preserve a tight game when his team is on top. As opposed to breaking balls and offspeed junk, he usually comes in and throws his outstanding fastball and, typically, slider.
