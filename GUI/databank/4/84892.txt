chouli
A dirty, stinking, neo-hippie, usually [vegan] and often sporting a [sluglock]. Named after their other signature smell, [patchouli]. Coined because 'hippie' only accurately refers to ancient ones, you know, from back in the days of free love and protests that actually affected something. Plural: a Stench of Choulies.
