Larry the Cable Guy
Here are some jokes from Larry the Cable Guy ; 'I was sniffing around at Victoria's Secret the other day. I was like a retard at a chucky cheese. Guess what they have. Underbritches with holes in the crotches. These things sell for 15 bucks. I'm sitting on a dwarful of those worth 250 bucks at home' ; 'They now have something called eatin' britches. I bought five pairs for my girlfriend and ate a couple on the way to her house. If they made biscuits and gravy flavored, I'd get fat just off that' ; 'I beleive if I was paid a dollar for every time my dad said he loved me...Well, money isn't important now' ; 'They say cellphones put microwaves in your body. This guy used one and pooped out a hot pocket' ; 'If you don't think that's funny, get the hell out of here' ; 'I have a deaf brother. He also has teret syndrome, so he's all like *makes nasty hand gestures*' ; 'My girlfriend read a hog hunter magazine and said 'Why don't you trim you're private areas, that'll look sexy.' Oh no, I said. An hour later I have razor bumps and toilet paper squares all over my balls' ; 'My grandma was in a farting contest...' ; 'GitRdone'
