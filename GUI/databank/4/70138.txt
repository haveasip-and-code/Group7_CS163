Queens English
Gramatically correct English. Plain, to the point, free of euphamisms, jargon, slang, inuendo, etc. ; There are some who deride the Queen's English as too exacting, too demanding, and accuse it of being a tool to discredit those who may have a valid point, but lack formal education, and are inarticulate, and use slang and incorrect grammar. The answer, of course, would be to give everyone a formal education, not to reject the proper pronounciation of words.
