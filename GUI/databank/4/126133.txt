herps
Another word for reptiles or amphibians, so you don't have to say that large phrase. Listen, which is easier? ; 'Man, let's go to florida, there's a ton of reptiles and amphibians down there.' ; 'Man, let's go to florida, there's a ton of herps down there.' ; MUCH easier. Although some illiterates and dyslexics think that 'herps' is another word for 'herpes', it isn't. Singularly, herp. Derived from the greek word that means 'things that crawl.'
