Commonwealth Team
Basically the greatest team to roam the on-line world of Halo. Were once challenged to a war by the [Blue team] and the [Red team], and completely made bitch meat of them bolth. Rumours are abound about a new challenge, which is widely regarded as a joke by the [Commonwealth team], but they love to humour other retarded teams so have obliged.
