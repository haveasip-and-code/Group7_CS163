Battle Royale
Amazing film, even thought the book is actually better. Bunch of kids trapped on an island and have to kill each other until there is only one left - great entertainment! ; Watch the film before you read the book. Probably the best film ever made and i swear if the USA try and rip it off into some trashy shit like they always do (think The Ring, Grudge, etc)i will seriously get pissed off.
