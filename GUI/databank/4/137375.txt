Interstate 10
The most rural Interstate (except maybe I-8). Between San Antonio and Los Angeles, I-10 is either in a large town or in absolute nothingness. It has an intersection with I-20 in the middle of nowhere in Texas, 130 miles from El Paso and 450 miles from San Antonio. ; Of somewhat interest is 'The Thing'. I myself do not know what that is but it is located near Texas Canyon, Arizona, on I-10. ; I-10 passes through these major cities: ; Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso (even though nobody would put it on this list), San Antonio, Houston, New Orleans, and Jacksonville.
