GRD
'Get 'r done'. A contraction of 'get her done'. The phrase generally means something close to 'let's get started' or 'let's go!' in regards to starting or accomplishing some task. The phrase has some underlying sexual innuendo, but in most uses of 'GRD' the term 'her' could easily be replaced with 'it' -- 'get it done'.
