prepzilla
The pinnacle of prep. The kind of kid who cries when when he gets 98% on his math test. These preps are thinking obout which University they want to attend at the age of 3. The prepzilla does not believe in fun. They go through their lives trying to get a 'good' job, but whats the point of getting an awesome job if your not going to enjoy it. Jobs are for money. Money is for fun and food.
