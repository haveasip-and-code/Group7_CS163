blyat
This russian word is one of the universe's greatest mysterious, including: ; What happend to the unknown wonders of the worlds? ; What is the true nature of god? ; Why god created animals out of meat if he did not want us to feast of them? ; etc. so does blyat comes along. The formal known version of this particular word is translated to simply- 'whore' 'slut' and other words that explain the oldest proffesion in this world. Yet, russians (and latley, Israelis as one, even without a slavic roots in blood) are using this term as a link-word, as a curse, almost anything you can imagine.
