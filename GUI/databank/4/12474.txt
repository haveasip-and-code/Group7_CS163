cranberry hangover
1. its when u give freshman cranberry juice and tell them theres alcohol in it while ur also drinking cranberry juice but with alcohol. the next morning when ur all together again everyone talks about how hungover they are and the freshman who pretened to be drunk now also has a cranberry hangover ; 2. when u sneek out for the whole night and spend all ur energy being wild that the next morning u fell tired as all hell
