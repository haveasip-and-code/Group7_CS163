wind waker
A pretty good game in the Zelda series, kept from being great by the fact that near the end you have to spend hours looking for thousands of rupees you need to buy stuff from that stupid Tingle. ; The most common reason this game is hated, though, is that nintendo took a big risk with the graphics in this game, making them cell shaded.
