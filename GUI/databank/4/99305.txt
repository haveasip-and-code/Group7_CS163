GTO
ahhh, the muscle car. Standing for gran turismo omologato, or nick-name GAS-TIRES-OIL., on account of your gonna need alot of all 3 when you drive it. Whatever you wanna call it, it was named after the ferrari 250 of the same badge. Appearing in 1964 as a high-end package on the tempest, it was the first muscle car, not mustang. If you look at [mustang] , those people try to say that it was the first. Anyway, in late '63, John DeLorean got to work, he dropped a 389 in a tempest to give it 325 hp, dual exhausts,AFB 4-barrel carb, 3.23 final drive and tons of GTO badges. Yes it got bigger, to 400 CI, but after '72, more fuel effecient cars were gaining popularity. In '74, it was discontinued. But in 04, america got to see the new GTO, true to its roots, 400 hp and rear wheel drive.
