constitutional option
Another name for the so-called 'nuclear' option which would prevent filibusters in the United States Senate, thus giving a large amount of power to simple majority of senators. The constitutional option would call for 51 votes to invoke cloture and end debate instead of the long established rule requiring two-thirds or 60 votes to invoke cloture.
