an amazing band from Mesa, Arizona, who despite coming into the public's eye with their hit The Middle, had already made to awesome records beforehand. Still, the LP that featured The Middle, Bleed American (self-titled after 9/11) is probably their best work. Their newest album, which came out in October of 2004, was also amazing, and the song Pain got heavy radio play. They're often called 'emo' but they hate that word.
