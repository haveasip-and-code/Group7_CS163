Poncho
A noob-ish Battlefield Vietnam player with delusions of granduer. A self congradulatory pip-squeak who perceives himself as knowing all but in fact knows very little. 'Poncho' is derived from ancient Aztec and literally translates to: Dickhead with bigmouth. This term is usually used in a derogitory sense when refering to someone of little worth.
