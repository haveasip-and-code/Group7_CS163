pittsburgh
A vast, lively city that is never the same twice. It looks like your typical mild-mannered, politically correct city, but the area's residents know that it is far more. Truly uplifting people, amazing turnouts for sporting events, lots of beer, Pennsylvania's largest concentration of Gothic Lolitas, a wonderful indie music scene, and some great colleges. ; Also, there is so much water. Three rivers meet at an area Pittsburghers have come to call The Point, and there's a cool fountain and picnic area there. Pittsburgh is also notorious for flooding. ; Finally, Pittsburgh's weather is off-the-wall. It's May as I'm writing this, and we had snow two weeks ago, warm-ish rain last week, and this week we're expecting it to be cold. Still.
