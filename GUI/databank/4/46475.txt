Urbandicks
Sick bastards who come to Urban Dictionary for the soul purpose of posting inappropriate terms and using other words in horrid context to make them nasty words. ; I don't often use their slang of saying body parts and actions as insults and curses, but in this case, I thought the title was quite fitting for the situation.
