lounce
A filler word pioneered and frequently utilized by entertainer Ross Hickey. Its primary purpose seems to be to flesh out a sentence, either when you are too tired of talking to finish a word or are so busy thinking about/doing other things that you forget what you are saying but don't want to just abruptly stop talking. Its secondary (and perhaps true) purpose remains unknown. Perhaps it just sounds cool. Perhaps it summons the demons. ; Special usage instructions are relatively nonexistant. Simply completely or partially replace any part of any word in your sentence. Or use it alone. Bonus points if you suddenly wake up from a nap and say it.
