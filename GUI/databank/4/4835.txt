the distillers
Great punk band, fronted by Australian born Brody Dalle, used to be married to Tim Armstrong of The Transplants, Rancid, and ex-Operation Ivy. Divorced after brody cheated with QOTSA singer. Who gives! she's only doing what everyone else does. whoever you are, you shouldn't hate Brody because of one stupid thing because you know she's beautiful, a mad guitar player, writes better songs than you ever will, and somehow makes screaming the most beautiful sound on earth.
