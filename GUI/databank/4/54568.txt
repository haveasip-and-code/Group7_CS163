Tiberian Sun
The Sequel to Command & Conquer and Command & Conquer: Renegade, The game is set in the 2030 (or 2031 I forgot). On Tiberian sun, Nod recovered itself when a man named Anton Slavik escapes Execution and then later on Executed his would be executor Hassan and when doing so Kane makes a surprise revival. On the GDI's side of the story: General James Soloman (played by James Earl Jones from Star Wars) realized that Kane is back in power and he plans to do Something about it, so he gets one of his best men, Commander Mike McNeil (Played by Michael Biehn from Termanator 1) Mike was also assigned to capture Nod General Vega who has been dealing a possible Tiberium based poison. Also there have been many new things with Tiberium in Tiberian Sun, Tiberium has grown rapidly causing Civilian evacuation from Temperate and tropical climates of the earth (those are ecosystems that Tiberium grow the fastest on) and caused almost all non-mutated Human Civilians to evacuated to the Colder Northern Regions of the Earth (eg, Scandinavia, North Russia and Siberia, North Canada, Greenland ext). Some humans who were infected by Tiberium gradually mutated into Tiberium mutants known as the Forgotten who were also known as Shiners as a racist slang by most non-infected Civilians and GDI personnel. The Forgotten (Shiners as we would call em) are major victims of Nod Tiberium research. Tiberium research was a key component for the Brotherhood of Nod's cyborg program and discover advanced Tiberium mutations such as Viceroids (which also appeared on Tiberian Dawn and renegade)fiends, Tiberium Floaters, and Tiberium Veinhole monsters (New mutant creatures on Tiberian sun). Command and Conquer: Tiberian I would say, Although a old and dated game (it was released back in the Summer of 1999) it has a intresting Plot and Story and James Earl Jones (aka: Darth Vader) is in it!
