real world
Lame ass MTV show, where they stick a couple of just out of college kids in a house, so that we, the viewers can listen to their converstaions, which usually go something like this: ; P1: 'Hey.' ; P2: 'Hey' ; P1:'What do you think about Joe?' ; P2:'I don't want to move our relationship to the next level' ; P1: '...' ; P2: 'Lets go to a club' ; P1: 'OK.' ; ... And this sort of thing continues. Unfortunately, it is the preference of some friends of mine, and is constantly on TV.
