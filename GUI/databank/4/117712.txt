Samurai Deeper Kyo
1: a manga written by akimine kamijyo. ; fictional story based around the thousand-man slayer 'demon eyes kyo' mixed with hatred, revenge, power, and lots and lots of blood. many battles and comic moments, however nothing like [rurouni kenshin] as some may say. ; 2: an extremely choppy and unworthy to the original story anime.
