dad rock
Dad rock is defined as the genre of music that is listened to uniquely by fathers, not grandfathers or children or mothers (though mothers may have adapted survival strategies to tolerate or ignore dad rock music). To be a dad rocker, you must own albums by all of the following three defining bands of the dad rock genre: Tom Petty and the Heart Breakers, Phill Collins, and Sting. Dad rock is most commonly heard blasting out of cameros, el caminos, vans, and large trucks on cassette or from the home on vinyl or, occassionaly, compact disc.
