PAKEP
Right, PAKEP is a protest...well it's now more like a cult...and it's for all of the instrumental players really! it actually means, protest against all kinds of examinary playing...so no scales basically!!!! nooo, die scales die!!!!!!! it has to go with the absolutely nessecary fist action, to show maximum respect...i'm serious! (lol) ; so, as Jesus once said, spread the word my fine friends!! (ok he didn't say that bit i don't think!)
