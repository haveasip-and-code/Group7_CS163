Mormonism
In 1832, Joseph Smith found golden plates on Hill Cumorah; a small, steep hill located in Palmyra, NY. So, Mormanism began. Every summer, Palmyra is infested with religion-spreading Mormons, merely hoping to pass their goodness unto the world through missionary work and abstinence. Here, they enjoy the festivities of the Hill Cumorah Pagent, the very site at which the religion was founded.
