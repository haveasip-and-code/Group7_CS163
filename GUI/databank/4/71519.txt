elder god
The above definitions are incorrect. ; [The Elder Gods] are an Ancient Stellar Race of Beings that dwelt in supreme darkness in a time long since forgotten, a time before there was ever Light. [The Ancient Ones] were the rulers of this darkness. Then came such a time that The Elder Gods stood up against the evil Ancient Ones and thus a Great and Terrific War was fought in the Heavens. ; The Great God Marduk, Begotten of Our Master Enki, Ruler of the Seas; Marduk, who is Lord of Lords and Master of Magicians, Fashioner of The Magic Name, The Magic Shape, The Magic Number and The Magic Word, was given Fifty Weapons and Fifty Powers with which to fight The Ancient Ones. These Powers are the remaining, unmentioned Names of The Elder Gods. ; During The Great War, the awful God Tiamat, The Writhing Serpent, was slain by Marduk and thrown down into Absu, The Abyss, there to be forever kept, save when a magician of the blackest of arts is skillful enough to rouse The Ancient Ones and The Serpent of the Deep, Cthulhu, and open The Gates to The Outside and allow Them that dwell Therein entry into Our World. ; And from the fluids of Tiamat were The Heavens and The Earth created as well as The Stars. ; Also slain was Kingu, Ruler of The Ancient Ones, and from His body He did bleed and from His blood did The Elder Gods create the race of Man.
