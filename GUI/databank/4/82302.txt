L.E.
Means Lowered Expectations. ; When the Women (or men) in the room are all ugly and makes the least ugly look hott. Normally when you would see the \'hott\' person on the street you wouldn\'t think twice but because you are surrounded by ugly people it makes then someone to lust after. Never settle for L.E.
