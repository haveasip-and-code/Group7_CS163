stamford  ct
A half urban, half suburban city in Connecticut. The school systems suck, there's nothing to do, and downtown is a joke. The ghetto kids think they're hardcore and the rich North Stamford kids are uptight kids who wear highwaters. The beaches are infested with dead babies and syringes, and there are no good restaurants. Doesn't compare with Greenwich or New Canaan.
