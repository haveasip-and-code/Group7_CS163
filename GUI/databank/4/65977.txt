Loungecore
A proposed genre of music which would be changed little from the original lounge singers of the 1950's and onwards. Largely Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, focusing largely on the values of the traditional 'gangster' and teaching a lesson to 'those damn kids'. There is also a focus on 'class', dressing well (suits, etc...).
