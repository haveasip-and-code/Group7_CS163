Crossing it up  Catholic Style
A handshake in the motion of the Catholic cross. It starts out as a normal handshake, then the hand position is changed so just the fingers are connected. From that point, the movement is up, down, then left to right and vice versa. The left to right movements should be done to the direction of the coolest person taking part in the shake. After the shake is done, it is optional for one to say 'Cross it up,' and the other to finish it by adding on 'Catholic Style'
