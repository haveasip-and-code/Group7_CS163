Weaverville
A wonderful tiny town where the kids do things like hiking, water sports at trinity lake, and go to the local movie theater and bowling alley. Just like other small towns, there is your underage drinking, but not to a crazy extent becuase there are things to do....AND IT SNOWS IN THE WINTER!!!! REAL SNOW!!! There is stuff to do every season. Stupid people complain about this perfect town when they live there and when they move away, all they want to do is move back. I LOVE WEAVERVILLE!!!!
