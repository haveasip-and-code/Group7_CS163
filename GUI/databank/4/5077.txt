the monkey
The monkey is a primate, which means that it is like a person except smaller, dumber, louder, hairier, and it (in most cases) lives in trees and has a tail. Monkeys are sometimes food for the [chimp], a superior animal which enjoys war, fornication, the use of primitive tools, and hooting. ; 'Monkey' can also be used more broadly in the sense of 'ape-like creature' or to refer to a person who resembles such a creature, such as a [troglodyte]. This is generally an insult (rarely, referring to a silly clownish person, it is not as harsh). In any case, the monkey generally enjoys the following: ; -stealing things, especially food ; -hurling excrement at people (see also [politician]) ; -comic [mischief] in general ; -[cocaine] ; -hooting
