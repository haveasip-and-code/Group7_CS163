Novo
A word used to describe the actions, attitudes, beliefs, and dispositions (among other things) of a lazy, apathetic, and above all worthless individual. ; Due to its unusual etymology (which will not be introduced in the interest of brevity), the word can assume a polysemous form -- that is, it can mean everything, yet simultaneously mean nothing. In addition, it is extremely versatile in terms of its usability (i.e., it can take the form of a noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
