good charlotte
a poser-punk band that tries to be emo but in reality, just sucks. they dress punk but then their music sounds like a darker version of the backstreet boys. if you would like to hear more about this band, head over to hot topic and ask all the preppy chicks, im sure they have a lot to say.
