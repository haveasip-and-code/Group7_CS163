Arbitrarism
n. Similar to agnosticism, a religion/philosophy that says that there is no omnipotentent god, but a force that controls true chance, not simply the roll of a die, since there are physical factors on that, but true randomness that no physical force could control. This pure randomness is very hard to find and may stretch farther than the creation of the universe.
