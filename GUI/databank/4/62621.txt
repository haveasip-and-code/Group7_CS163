bello
A nickname given to a man with impecable looks, witty comebacks, guido style, HUGE muscles and who is commonly from an Italian decent. A short nickname that is given by one's paesans to he who is needed in such settings: a crowded nightclub, the line outside of that crowded nightclub, in a bar when ordering numerous drinks for rowdy Americans, on a guestlist where a catchy name is needed for those to remember when they are half in the bag and want to have a good time, in the bedroom with some whure, and in the gym when you casually see him flex.
