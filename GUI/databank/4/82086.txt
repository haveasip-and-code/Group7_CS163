prague
A beautiful city in Central Europe. Home to 1.2 million Czechs and countless ex-patriates; cheap beer, second only to the Belgians and arguably neck-and-neck with the Germans; a beautiful Old Town Square, framed by an Astronomical Clock and the Tyn Church, unfortunately clogged with tourists in the summer; and a number of production teams who help American film producers too poor to shoot in the United States. A charming metropolis soon to be overrun by a double-bladed sword of post-communist economic growth and tourism.
