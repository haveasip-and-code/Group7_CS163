Arnold Schwarzenegger
The current governor of California. Republican; yet more liberal than average, making him more popular with the people than the average republican in left-wing California. ; He's relentlessly criticized and attacked by the messed-up teacher's unions for 'taking money away from the schools,' when in fact he did not anything away at all. He simply did not pay them as much as what they are used to getting, which may be a good thing. ; The commercials and attack ads against him are claiming to be in favor of helping with the students' needs, but in reality it just a way for the teachers to get people to help them satisfy their greed. It's not about the students... it's the money. ; The teacher unions are also against Schwarzenegger's plan for paying the teachers based on performance. Don't you think bad teachers should be paid less than good ones? ; Please people, you all claim that Schwarzenegger isn't helping with the budget crisis, but do you know why he doesn't seem to be helping? BECAUSE OF THE WORKERS AND TEACHERS UNIONS! The special-interest groups are in fact an obstacle in the way of solving the budget problem. By supporting them, you are just screwing California even more! ; Trust me, if Gray Davis was still the governor, we would be a lot worse off.
