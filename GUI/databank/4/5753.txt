about one of the coolest girls at Unionville. Always blares some form of music. Great artist, great friend, maybe too much time on her hands, but always a smile on her face...maybe she just did something funny..maybe she just farted and thought it was funny...maybe she put ketchup on your seat just as you sat down on....hehehe
