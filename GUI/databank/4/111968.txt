little barrie
A three-piece UK group heavily influenced by old-school blues and rock. Their music is hailed as bare and raw, and this is true after one listens to their debut album, 'We Are Little Barrie'. There are no special effects or digitally added/enhanced sections. Their music is in touch with roots and blues, it is light and as a result very 'funky', to borrow a word from clueless critics in national newspapers (for instance, those who call them 'Little Barry', say they are a two-piece, call them the next big thing for 'indie kids'). ; Barrie Cardogan, the vocalist & guitarist, has been hailed as some as the best guitarist of his generation and as a prodigy. His nasal, carefree voice is a perfect match to Little Barrie's light and soulful music. ; Little Barrie can be recognised by amazing basslines and simple drums, and a steadily progressing guitar that at first sounds simplistic and amateuristic, but after careful listening shows remarkable talent. ; Their first full length album, 'We Are Little Barrie' (13 tracks) was released in around January of 2005.
