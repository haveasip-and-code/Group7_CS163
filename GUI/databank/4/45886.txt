shaming
(v.) the act of bringing embarassment to a drunk individual. The individual is usually sober, but if drunk enough, shaming can occur while the subject is awake. All shamings should be recorded in some form, either through pictures or movies. Shamings usually occur because the individual passed out first or passed out with their shoes on. ; Shaming can be a number of things: piling random objects on a person [jenga]-style, writing on them with permanent ink, shaving or cutting the individual's hair into embarassing styles (ex: a [mullet]), or any other creative way to bring embarassment upon the intoxicated party without their knowledge. ; Sometimes referred to as the individual being '[owned]'.
