Bambied
When one get's so ludacrisly wasted that thier legs cannot support the weight of their body. They often fall down and have to be carried to bed becuase their legs have the working capacity of a little newborn baby deer (Bambi). This term was first coined in the CBC house to describe this reoccuring and extremely troubling yet hilarious level of drunken crazyness.
