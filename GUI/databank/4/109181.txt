rust belt
1. Declining industrial area of the Midwest including but not limited to Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania that declined dramatically in the 1960's and 1970's after factories were closed and the im-migration of Southern blacks caused widespread [white flight], resulting in severe population loss. Examples of large Rust Belt cities include Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh. Cleveland, St. Louis, Detroit, and Pittsburgh were hit especially hard, although, ironically, these cities are making a comeback and revitalizing their downtown areas with attractions.
