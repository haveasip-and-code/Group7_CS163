haste the day
One of the best band to appear on solid state records. they are a combination of metal, hardcore, and screamo. They pack solid and catchy guitar riffs (though sometimes monotonuos) with a steady beats and disorted vocals. They have their unique brand of screaming, a more deep, brooding scream that fits well with the fast-paced bass and guitars (though the screaming is the worst aspect of the band...). The chorus of the songs if the real charm though since they take part in singing them (the better half of the songs). In all, the inovative, heavy sounding band is sure to attract followers of metalcore/screamo/emo bands.
