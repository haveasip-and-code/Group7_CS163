RCT
The RollerCoaster Tycoon series (Also referred to now as RCT1, RCT2, or RCT3) ; This game allows players to build the theme park of their dreams through a simple point-and-click system. RCT1 and RCT2 were both two-dimensional 45 degree-view engines while RCT3 became the first 3D RCT game, which was famous for the 'Ride the Rides' feature which allows players to get down at ground level with the park guests and ride the rides in their parks. Other cool features in RCT3 include the new Fireworks Mixmaster, which allows players to design custom fireworks shows to music.
