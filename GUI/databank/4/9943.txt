Pants Bunny
1. When you use an iron to dry your underwear, the iron turns excess water into steam and lifts it away into the air, leaving the underwear warm and fluffy. Like a bunny, but in your pants. A pants bunny. ; (taken from a story by [Jay Barnes]) ; 2. One who likes being in someone's pants. My boyfriend's nickname for me.
