People- can we please grow up by now? I think this Urban Dictionary thing is going too far. At first it was a cat fight, now every one in school is getting hit with this. Why can't everyone just back off of peoples biz. And when you hear something about someone, keep it to yourself, you don't look any cooler when you are gossiping.
