Dribble Feet
When a dangerous case of diarrea catches you short without a nearby toilet. Unable to hold in 'the shits' the person must soil themselves. Normally a solid shit would leave them with cement pants however with the runs the stale faeces drips down their legs and socks into their feet, leaving them with scwelching shit feet.
