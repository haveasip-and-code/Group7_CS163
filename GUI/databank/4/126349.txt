BMG
1.) big mother-fucking gun ; 2.) a 1/2 inch wide (.50-cal) bullet full of whup-ass, dubbed 'Browning Machine Gun' after the heavy machine gun it is used in (the M2HB). Barrett also has a full line of Sniper and hunting rifles that use the .50 BMG round. It has the capability to penetrate light armor and an entire engine block of a truck, completely immobilizing it from a fair amount of distance. Not to mention the fact that it would take off the limb of a human if shot placement is correct.
