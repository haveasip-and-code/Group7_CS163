Mad Cat
BattleTech Universe only. ; The Mad Cat was the first Clan 'Mech to be seen in the Inner Sphere, and is likely the trademark 'Mech of all of the Clans because of its incredible versatility, speed, and staying power. Massing at 75 tons and moving as fast as most Inner Sphere medium 'Mechs, the Mad Cat supposedly gets its name from the boxy missile pods of a Catapult (Cat) and the dual-laser arms of a Marauder (the designation of the Marauder was MAD, i.e. MAD-5T). ; Unless you're in a Clan 'Mech of your own or in something larger, steer clear as just one in any configuration will ruin your day.
