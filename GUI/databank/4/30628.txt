ax
The way which some people say 'ask' but mix up the sk - ks (just as many anglo-Americans say asterix instead of asterisk). Ax is very old however. The verb to ask comes from an Old English word which was written either as ascian or as acsian. Ax remained an accepted form of ask until the 16th century.
