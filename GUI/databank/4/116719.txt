One of the most underappreciated members of Pink Floyd, like the other members other than Roger Waters. One of the most amazing guitarists around with a very distinctive style and underrated solo stuff. He also was the voice and influence that made Pink Floyd a much more publicly successful band that joined up when Syd destroyed himself on drugs. Also not an asshole, because he didnt go on a power trip and kick out a member of his band and threaten to take away all the stuff he'd written if that member didnt leave. Listen to a few off his 1978 self-titled solo record, especially if you're a guitarist, and you will understand. Just imagine 'Wish You Were Here' sung by Waters, and you get the picture.
