The Jaimie
'The Jaimie' is a common expression used amongst teenagers. It involves a person telling a joke, thinking it's the funniest thing in the world, and their listener giving them a weird look which creates awkwardness. Consequently, the speaker usually nervously looks around the room to avoid eye contact with the listener. You are expecting someone to break out in laughter, however the moment sort of fizzles away leaving an awkward silence. The creator of this popular expression, Jaimie B., obliviously used it constantly and the emotion was soon adopted by her friends, Hannah, Tori, and Colleen.
