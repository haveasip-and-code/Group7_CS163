Kingdom Hearts
An RPG produced in 2002 by Square-Enix and Disney. Featuring character designs by Tetsuya Nomura, well known for Final Fantasy VII, VIII and X, as well as Parasite Eve 1 & 2, the game follows Sora, a 14-year-old boy on a quest to reunite with his friends Kairi and Riku. Along the way, he teams up with various Disney characters including Donald Duck, Goofy, Tarzan, Aladdin, Ariel, Jack Skellington and others as he battles the Heartless that threaten to destroy all worlds. ; While the gameplay was above-average and the re-playability good, many 'hardcore' fans don't consider this game up to Square's standards. Tougher-than-thou fans point out the child-like simplicity of a boy defeating the darkness in people's hearts as being too kiddish, as well as making fun of the inclusion of Disney characters, because as we all know, Disney = TEH EVAL!!!1 ; If people took the time to play the game without inhibitions and enjoy it for what it is -- Not Final Fantasy -- they might find that they would enjoy the game far more than they think. ; The game features various Square cameos as well as Disney, including Cloud (FFVII), Aerith (FFVII), Yuffie (FFVII), Sephiroth (FFVII), Squall/Leon (FFVIII), Selphie (FFVIII), Tidus (FFX), and Wakka (FFX). ; The original PS2 Kingdom Hearts spawned an array of related media, including a PS2 sequel (due the fall of 2005), a sequel for the GBA entitled Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, and a manga series. Who knows what the future will hold for this extremely popular franchise?
