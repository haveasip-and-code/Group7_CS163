The Big Nasty
The actual act of sexual intercourse, man-to-woman; woman-to-man. When I was young (many eons ago) they had the 'base' system: ; 1st base: kissing and maybe some 'under the sweater' action ; 2nd base: french kissing and fondling ; 3rd base: naked bodies rubbing together, but NO penetration ; 4th base or home run: sexual intercourse ; It got stupid to say 4th base and saying home run during baseball season could be confusing. So the act bacame The Big Nasty.
