cubbie
An early manifestation of cougars (see UD definition). Usually applies to very late twenties and early thirties women who are desperate for a mate since all their girlfriends have just gotten married. They often appear like fun party girls, at first, but then reveal their true desperate, land-a-man motives. Be wary.
