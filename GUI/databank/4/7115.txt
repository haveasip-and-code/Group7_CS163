rocker
Before i get started, Rocker is not a label, its a just... a way of life! ; The term Rocker applies to any person who genuinely likes listening to any type of rock music over other types of music, but not ruling out other music styles. There are many types of of Rockers such as [Goths], [Emos], [Indies], [Moshers], [Punks], [Metalheads] and [Hippies] to name a few, it is not uncommon for the different types to argue amongst each other yet there can be also great friendships between different types. A person who has no affiliation must not be confused and take in that a certian group of rockers are infact [posers] or [wanabees] for this is an insult or term to call one fake or shallow and not being themselvs. Most Rockers are generally at odds with groups such as [Chavs], [Jocks] and [scallies] because those groups are generally [dickheads], [wankers] and/or [scumbags]!!!
