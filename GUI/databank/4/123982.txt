Aflac
An American Life Insurance company that has a line of commercials featuring a duck that mysteriously acquires the abnormally-loud voice of Gilbert Godfried. The unnamed duck can only say the name of the Life Insurance company he, for some unexplained reason, endorses: 'Aflac.' The duck has the ability to appear anywhere in the world where a Life Insurance-related conversation is taking place. However, no human can actually hear his 'advice.'
