Confederate Flag
Piece of archaic southern history sometimes refered to as 'heritage'. In common practice, those proudly displaying the confederate flag are extreme nationalists, showing immense hypocrisy in the fact that the flag was seperatist and used in the fight AGAINST national unity, or rednecks who believed that the American Civil War was a fight for freedom from oppression and not just the desire to continue slavery, print different money for each individual state without clear exchange rates, form alliances between states, and throw the nation into unending divisive war.
