black pride
a mindset spawned by society due to modern civilizations fixation on the hatred of people of color. as we continue to emerge from the mentality of the dark ages and into enlightenment, hatred continues to diminish, togetherness profounds itself, and the need for race based esteem issues fly away, as we will all be of one color and community.
