batchload
A person who is a real piece of work. Someone either really complex or really screwed up or someone almost unbearably hard to handle. ; The genesis of the term can be traced from a person being a real piece of 'work' or a real 'load' and multiple jobs and tasks are often done in 'batches.' Thus.. a person who is extremely screwed up can be called a 'batchload'
