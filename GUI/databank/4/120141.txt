The Ice Cube Line
The line that is tragically crossed when a naive child suggests seeing a movie starring Ice Cube. Once this line is crossed, it is imperative that you stay away from the movie theater, for the sake of the growing minds of our innocent American children. If you foolishly choose to step across this line and you go to see an Ice Cube matinee, you will have lost an oh-so-precious two hours of your life that you will never be able to get back.
