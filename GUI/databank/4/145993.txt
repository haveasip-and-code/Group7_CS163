Licken Cheg
Slang for the 'Chicken Leg' health power up that first came to prominence in the [Castlevania] series of [videoames] by Japanese developer [Konami]. A low level health increase that for some strange reason Dracula decided to hide within the breakable walls of his castle. Although well worth collecting it pales into insignificance when compared the rejuvinational properties of the mighty [Turnkey Dinner].
