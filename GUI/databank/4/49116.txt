rap
Simply another music genre. Started sometime in the 1970's by the 'Sugar Hill Gang' with the song, 'Rappers Delight', which was spawned by Disco. 'Funk' beats were originally behind the vocals. In the 1980's, groups like 'N.W.A.' and 'Ice-T' felt the need to get the message across that African-Americans were not being treated with equal rights, so they turned to music. Heavy beats and 'hard-core' lyrics were introduced to the music and this was the birth of 'Gangster(a)' rap. Then rappers had idea's to release tension from their hard lives or growing up in poverty which led to rappers like 'Tupac' and 'Biggie'. Now days, it is hard to find a rapper who is actually trying to send a message across, most people are just trying to make money or show their verbal skill. ; Rap is bashed a lot by narrow minded people. These people like what they want to like and anything different is not worth their time and should not be to any other people. Usually people who like Rock or 'Punk'. These people can often be found saying things like 'Wanna disco with me?' ; 'Disco is the sex'. And what do you know; Disco spawned Rap.
