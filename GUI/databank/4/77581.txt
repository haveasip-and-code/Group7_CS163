Suncoast
They are sometimes refered to by their entire name, Suncoast Motion Picture Company. This store is quite possibly the worst place to work - ever. Since being purchased by Best Buy in 2000, things have only continued to decline in the work place and in sales. Steer clear of this horrible job and of their over priced DVDs.
