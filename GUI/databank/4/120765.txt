clontu
Etymology: Clontu -> clonto -> clont -> phont -> pwnt -> [pwnd] -> [ownd] -> [own]. Originally coined by a prominent [ownerer] by the name of Mr. Fortin, a certain zebra in the recent Disney movie 'Racing Stripes,' elicited to be [christ]ened this name when, in laughing his proverbial arse off with his good [ownerer] friend Mr. Gutter, made the wild query 'Is this Clontu?' This name was, at the time, in Mr. Gutter's MSN username, and thus, the name Clontu was put to the retardedness of the 'Racing Stripes' poster shown in the movie theatre on that fateful day.
