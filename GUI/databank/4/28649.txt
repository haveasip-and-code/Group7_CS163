The OC
A show that is horrifically innacurate and contains mind-numbingly bad acting, yet is shockingly entertaining every week. All the people who hate on the OC are wannabe non-conformists who rebel against anything 'mainstream' and go slit their wrists at night. Stop trying to be cool. We all know you secretly watch it.
