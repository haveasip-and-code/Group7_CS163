fox hunting
Fox hunting is a much misunderstood thing. Hounds will not be sent down after a fox because lets face it, they're just slightly too big! ; The hunt generally kills off the older or weaker foxes, as a healthy fox can easily outrun them. These older and weaker foxes are the ones more likely to kill chickens and the such as they cannot find food any other way. ; With the ban of hunting, the culling of foxes will not stop. Since the population is not controlled by the hunt, more people will start shooting them, which can lead to injuries as a moving target is quite hard to kill cleanly. Also, it will be the healthier foxes that are culled aswell. People might even start snaring again, which a particularly cruel way of dealing with vermin and dangerous to other animals, but what other choices are there? ; I am not an upperclass 'toff'. ; I have seen the way anti-hunt protesters have behaved towards hunters, for example a small girl on horseback was surrounded by jeering antis and terrified. People have had their tyres deflated or cars scratched for supporting a rural service which few of the antis understand. ; Get your facts right, give a worthwhile arguement, and then we might take you seriously.
