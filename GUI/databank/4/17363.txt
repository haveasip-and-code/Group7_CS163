Lax
Lax is the sub-culture associated with lacrosse. Laxers usually dress in flip-flops, lacrosse t-shirts w/ a hawaiian shirt overtop,shorts (usually khaki) and a hat or visor. A lacrosse stick can always be found near a laxer most of the time. Laxers also don't get all hateful with players from another team ( cuz we're not jerks)
