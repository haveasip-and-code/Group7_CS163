buick
Formerly a revered marque that has been continuously ruined by General Motors for over 90 years, mostly through badge engineering, marketing neglect, and a complete lack of imagination. Will never escape the stigma of being an old fart's transportation around a stagnating Florida retirement community. Its decline escalated during the 80s as the General tried to make it look like a European brand (?!?) through hare-brained marketing exercises that ultimately served to remove any remaining shred of credibility the brand possessed. Now shares platforms with virtually every mid-size and large vehicle in the GM lineup, and has been reduced to swapping badges with desirable premium SUVs like the Pontiac Asstek. ; Tiger Woods sponsorship a bizarre way to attract young(er) buyers who were not even aware of Buick's continued existance.
