Serbia
A region of southeast Europe, comprising most of the former country of Yugoslavia. Serbs settled in the area in the 6th through 7th century, were Christianized in the 9th century, and formed an independent kingdom in the 13th century. Defeated at Kosovo Field (1389), the Serbs fell under Turkish domination, which ended when Serbia was granted full independence in 1878. The new kingdom of Serbia gained territory and power during the Balkan wars (1912-1913). After the assassination (1914) of Archduke Francis Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, sparking World War I. In 1918 Serbia became a major constituent of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which was later (1929) renamed Yugoslavia. Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, leading to war with Serbia. In 1992 Serbia and Montenegro formed a new republic.
