Pi
1. A really awesome black and white movie made in 1998. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, director of Requiem for a Dream (which I didn't know till I looked it up just now). It's about a crazy math guy that is trying to predict the stock market, when his machine dies and spits out a number (which isn't pi). He believes the number is the key to understanding the universe and God. I don't want to give away what happens after that though. ; 2. Approximately 3.14. Used in math and such.
