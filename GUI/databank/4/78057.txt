lithuania
A beautiful, strong-willed country that has miraculously survived the grip of soviet communists, corrupt invaders, and war-monging outsiders for centuries. Has approximately the same population as Toronto and is roughly the size of Ireland. Also the last country in Europe to accept Christianity.
