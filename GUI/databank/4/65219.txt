The Field School
A school in Northwest DC. It used to be in a town house downtown, but then it moved to a big mansion, and changed like crazy. ; This school is so uptight, and you get in trouble for the stupidest things. ; Most of the kids are stoned all the time, as well as some of the teachers. ; Almost every single kid that attends this school has ADD, ADHD or some other learning disability. ; They are starting to let in really weird kids, and the middle schoolers are so fucking annoying and think they rule the school.
