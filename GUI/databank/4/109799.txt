modder
A person who changes their car from the standard, factory condition they bought it, to something different. There are many examples of modders; Nova boys (see [nova boys]) drive shitter sheds with 30hp, 90% rust and cost less than a bag of chips. Rude boys, with their 1.2 corsa, clio, saxo, 106, fiesta, escort etc, that has double the amount the car is worth, spent on it in the form of bodykits, blinging alloys and sound systems. A real modder, someone who drives a sports performance car, such as a nissan skyline, and has tuned it up from 350hp to 990hp. Credit goes to them
