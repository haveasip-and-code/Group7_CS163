hippo-cheese
A dairy product which is used to attract and capture wild hippos. After a hippo sized hole is dug in the ground it is covered by leaves over a straw mat. The cheese is placed in the centre. Nocturnal feeding hippos are lured by the scent of the cheese and fall into the hole below. They can then be domesticated and trained to be house-hippos. ; Also used to describe something that appears better than it seems or lures somebody into danger.
