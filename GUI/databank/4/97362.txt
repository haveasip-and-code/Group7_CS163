watergate
Any incredibly long, boring and mystifying process; something bad, tedious and of interest only to fools. A show put on for the public to convince them that the government is accountable and journalists have teeth. A settling of scores between rival corrupt elements of the elite. Also now used for any case of corruption, eg, Zipper-Gate, Monica-Gate, etc. Surely there should be a Gates-Gate involving Bill Gates - we just have to hope for that.
