GENETICAL
synonymous with hereditary. While 'genetical' is NOT an actual word according to Webster, many, many people from different regions, nationalities, and social levels use 'genetical' in their life. ; Those that do not use this word understand that it is simply 'not a word', however, 'genetical' is completely understandable and needs no defintion. ; *My goal is to perpetuate the advancement of the 'word' genetical. If you have used this word, please spread the word on UB.dom and maybe Webster will add this WORD into the dictionary.* WHO just DECIDED it shouldn't be a word anyways?!?!?!
