Yuppie Bike
Motorcycles that have come on the scene due to the shows 'American Chopper' & Biker Build off, etc... Big Dog, is a primary supplier of yuppie bikes, or go to any number of 'Custom Bike Shop' that have sprung up in the past 2 years. Wonder where they will be 2 years from now. Don't forget the vest & chaps, You won't look cool without them........
