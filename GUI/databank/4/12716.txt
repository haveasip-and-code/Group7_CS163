stuyvesant
A school for the criminally insane. Althought it is rumoured to be one of the 'great' schools of New York, it isn't. The only thing great about Stuyvesant is its building, which was made quite recently. This building, of course, was originally designed for Brooklyn Technical High School but they turned it down. The reason you need a high score on the entrance exam is to ensure that you're insane enough to study for a test that makes little difference in your life.
