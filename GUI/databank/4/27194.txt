You're Pregnant, So I Kicked You In The Stomach ; I THOUGHT YOU WERE A FAT CHICK ; THEN I REALIZED YOU WERE PREGNANT ; I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF YOUR BABY DIED ; SO I KICKED YOU IN THE STOMACH ; I KICKED YOU, YOUR BABY'S DEAD ; I KICKED YOU, YOUR BABY'S DEAD ; I KICKED YOU, YOUR BABY'S DEAD ; HA HA HA YOUR BABY'S DEAD ; THERE WERE NO STAIRS TO THROW YOU DOWN ; THERE WAS NO ROOF TO THROW YOU OFF ; THERE WERE NO COAT HANGERS AROUND ; SO I KICKED YOU IN THE STOMACH ; I KICKED YOU, YOUR BABY'S DEAD ; I KICKED YOU, YOUR BABY'S DEAD ; I KICKED YOU, YOUR BABY'S DEAD ; HA HA HA YOUR BABY'S DEAD
