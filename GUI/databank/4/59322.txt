vaa
Acronym for Volunteer Association of America (VAA). One of many fraudulent volunteer associations designed to lure would-be good souls into a mythological world of non-activities and servitude. ; Origins of the fallacious group can be traced back to a one-time good soul who volunteered his time and efforts to help out a worthy cause in rural southwest Virginia. Later the good-soul-turned-bad decided that the real reason he was volunteering was to collect mileage reimbursement. The greedy being then made false accusations of failure to pay and began the VAA in hopes of tricking naive do-gooders into signing up with the VAA and an eternity of lies, falsified documents and embezzlement. ; The VAA founder continues to this day, to make false allegations, and post derogatory comments about other volunteer groups in hopes of obtaining world domination.
