hige
According to one source on the internet hige refers to the creases across the top of the legs of vintage Levi jeans - usually the so called 'big E' variety. It's like where the jeans bunch up when you sit down. However, I think it can also be used to refer to any person, place or thing that has a distressed, rather lived in look.
