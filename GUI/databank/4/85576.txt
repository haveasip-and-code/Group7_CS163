happy hardcore
A genre of music that emerged from the old skool hardcore rave scene circa 1990-1992. ; After 3 years of continuous drug abuse the rave scene and music shifted to whats known as Dark/The Darkside/Darkcore around 1993. ; The scene then split into Jungle/Drum and Bass and Happy Hardcore (the original hardcore/rave sound combined all the elements of both genres) during 1994/1995 and both evolved to become what they are today.
