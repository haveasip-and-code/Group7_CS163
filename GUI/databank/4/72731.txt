pet the pony
an expression used to euphemistically describe sexual activity-- of any sort ; when a guy says it to a girl, it's meant to sound cute, sweet and boyishly charming--and when he uses the term in front of his guy friends it means he really likes the gal he's discussing and won't even use crass talk about sex with her ; girls don't use the term with each other except jokingly, as if were so stuuupid to say that, but whatever, it's cute, and they know if a guy's using it he's at least trying to be suave
