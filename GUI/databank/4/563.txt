breakdancing
the term 'breakdancing' or 'breakdancer' was coined by the media in the late 80's as the dance became highly commercialised from more people getting involved in the hip-hop scene. ; b-boys were getting alot of exposure in movies, commercials and were often seen dancing on the streets. People were amazed by the breath-taking maneuvers that a breaker would preform eg. flips, headspins, backspins, windmills, flares etc... ; Very soon the public wanted to do 'them cool tricks that spin and stuff' to please the crowd. Therefor only learning the 'power' moves that a b-boy preforms and not learning the fundamentals of b-boying such as toprock, footwork and freezes. ; breakdancers are usually looked down apon on the b-boying community as true b-boys break because they love dancing not to gain attention from a crowd.
