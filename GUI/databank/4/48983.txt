Linux
A non-operating system that still hasn't lived up to its excessive [hype], because the geeks in the community are; ; (a) too busy arguing with each other over which [distro] is the best, ; (b) blaming [Microsoft] even for ridiculous things such as huricanes, tsunamis, and last year's boom of aphids, and ; (c) producing variants of Linux that are completely incompatible with each other. ; While distros of Linux such as [Mepis] and [Ubuntu] are showing some promise, it would be logic-defying if the Linux community FINALLY produces something that actually is worth using on the desktop without any program installation hassles by 2010.
