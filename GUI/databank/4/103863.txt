black pass
A fictional possession meaning that you are black in the sense of style, attitude, pride in the black race, etc. ; Basically to [keep it real] when you are black. ; But it can be considered revoked if you do otherwise. For example be black, but a [Goth] or [Punk] (musical sense) ; It's a common joke that then it is revoked, to turn it in at the nearest [liquor sto] on Martin Luther King blvd, and turn it in. Also you can do so at Roscoes Chicken & Waffles...
