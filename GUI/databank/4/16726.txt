Wendy's
The biggest fast food cesspool to work at, second to [McDonald's]. The managers are fat white trash and treat all their subordinates like shit. Stoners love to come through the pick-up window at 2 AM and order 45 Jr. Bacon cheeseburgers. The only good thing there is the chili, Big Bacon's, and fries with cheese on them. Frosty's aren't half bad either.
