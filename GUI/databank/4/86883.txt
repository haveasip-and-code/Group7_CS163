FPF
Simply, Fat Person Friendly. Refers to places and objects that can support the needs of the morbidly obese such as but not limited to chairs, hallways, and all-you-can-eat buffets. In recent years, FPF logic has really come into play because our population is exploding. Engineers now have to design hospitals to accomodate the gravitationally-challenged.
