IOU
truly stands for I Owe Unto. ; as in i owe unto you this amount. ; it is really just an expresion nowadays not really used because people as a whole cannot be trusted to pay debts ot just plain trusted. this is not urban but i saw someone else post this 'word' and obviously hadnt a freakin clue what the true meaning is.
