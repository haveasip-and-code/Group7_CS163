deathmatch
A game mode featured in nearly every shooter (simulator or FPS) that allows you to blow the living crap out of your opponents. It was popularized by Doom and pretty much made it a requirement for every shooter in the market after. These days multiple modes of deathmatches (like Capture the Flag and Team games) exist.
