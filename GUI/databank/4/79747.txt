Researching Treacher-Collins syndrome at the National Craniofacial Associaton's website, I found out that the syndrome, also called mandibulofacial dysostosis, causes facial anomolies and sometimes speech and hearing problems. It does not cause a tendency to 'act retarded', 'moo and stuff' or 'take dumps everywhere'. ben, I would diagnose your condition as the results of INBREEDING, rather than a case of Treacher Collins syndrome.
