time of your life
Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) is so un-Green Day yet so wonderfully-Green Day at the same time. It is my favourite song and is played often at graduations, funerals etc. ; Many people won't accept that this is the same people who did American Idiot. It is Green Day does MOR and it's just so appealing to everyone. ; There are various theories about what Billie Joe Armstrong was meaning when he wrote this: ; 1 After a break up ; 2 Looking back on your life on your death-bed ; 3 Getting totally drunk ; 4 Green Day's way of saying 'ha ha ha, we don't need you' to the people who hated them after they became popular.
