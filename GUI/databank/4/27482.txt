PT
Port Tampa ; This is one of the oldest ghettos in Tampa Bay, but it's also a dying cause. Once home to an ecclectic group of evil-doers such as gangs, drug-dealers, and Hulk Hogan, this 'hood is now turning into a high-scale yuppie area. One area of the 'hood that Hogan once described as the place he would 'get high with truckers and then kick their asses' is now the Westshore Yach Club. Still, however, young white people in PT believe that they are in the roughest part of Tampa, but they aren't.
