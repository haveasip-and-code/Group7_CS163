SPARTAN
An inconsistent and underachieving football team from East Lansing, Michigan. They are marked by a mascot with a giant head and an inferiority complex expressed through their hatred for the University of Michigan. A typical spartan will jeer and trash-talk before the Michigan-MSU game and, win or lose, burn a couch or two; riot; and trash-talk after the game. ; The females of the species can be identified by a pleasing-to-the-eye countenance, but a very limited vocabulary and understanding of basic social skills. The males are unkempt, wearing either school colors (white and green) or t-shirts bearing cartoon images of large-breasted women and drunk men peeing. They generally smell of alcohol and have difficulty forming complete sentences.
