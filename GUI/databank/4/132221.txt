A radio show host who isn't afraid to tell it like it is. Unfortunately, his version of 'telling it like it is' involves constructing his opinions with the most obvious statements in sports. ; For example: 'Yeah, right, Barry. You're not on steroids. Your head has just tripled in size over the last four years naturally.' Is that really something that listeners have never heard before?
