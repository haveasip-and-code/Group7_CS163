gazebo
A wooden haven where bold drug addicted kids go to smoke pot in public. No matter if it is day or night at Manhattan College, kids can be found smoking pot and sometimes even worse (ex: peddling 30 tabs of acid in one day whille tripping balls). Nowadays the gazebo is under extreme surveillance and the days of blatant drug use are over.
