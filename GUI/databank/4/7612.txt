Glam Rock Panda
The Glam Rock Panda is a rare breed of the Chinese marsupial, dwelling in the alleyways of China's harems and bar streets. They are normally six feet tall, covered from head to toe in neon green dyed fur, and wear what drunken onlookers have described as 'shitloads of makeup'. They are, without a doubt, the ninth wonder of the world, and should be given utmost respect and appreciation. The mating call sounds very similar to that of Cyndi Lauper's 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun'
