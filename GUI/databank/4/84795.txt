cincinnasty
To describe a southwest Ohio city called Cincinnati which is heavily polluted and has tons of run down neighborhoods. Kids on the corner selling crack. A very conservative town that would rather crack down on people owning a playboy than the Chicago like crime scene. A place many escape to find that the world is not such a bad and ugly place.
