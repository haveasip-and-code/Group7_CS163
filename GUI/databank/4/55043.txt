Jellyrolls
The best dueling pianos bar in Florida. Includes such classic acts as: Ray singing 'Baby Got Back', Scotty acting like Kermit, Drew playing Eminem, Chris playing the girl in 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light', Jason rocking to Aerosmith, and Tommy hitting every note perfectly on 'American Pie'. An essential stop on every Orlando visit.
