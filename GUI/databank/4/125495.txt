rummage
A sale of secondhand items, held in a driveway, garage, or front yard. They usually take place on Saturday mornings in summer. ; From [rummage sale], so called because it is a sale where you can freely 'rummage' (or sort) through things in piles or boxes. ; They typically include used clothes, old records, ancient appliances, [Happy Meal] toys, potholders, small brass deer, broken watches, coffee cups, and 'crafty' Christmas decorations. Each sale is different, and finding something good is not a guarantee. (One might argue that it is actually unlikely, as you are sorting through someone else's cast-offs.) ; It's main appeal is the [thrill of the hunt] and the chance at finding a real [bargain].
