Carlos Barat
Singer/Songwriter of British band [The Libertines]. He is a fabulous musician, and his interviews are usually quite insightful. He is intelligent. And fucking hott. Is said by many LJ-Junkies to be a raging homosexual with his former bandmate [Pete Doherty] whom he has had an intense love-hate relationship with, but nonetheless, Carl is a sex god who had decided to move on in his career.
