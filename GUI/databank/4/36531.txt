afghani
This is not what you call people from Afghanistan. This is the currency that they use. In Europe they use Euros, in Turkey they use Liras, well in Afghanistan they use Afghani's. People from Afghanistan are called 'AFGHANS' NOT 'AFGHANI'S' ; And also- ; Afghanistan is a central asian country not a south asian country, because we're not the same as the Indian Sub Continent.
