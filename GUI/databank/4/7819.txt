suffocation
An underrated band that combines elements of death and grind, yielding a genre called 'brutal death metal.' You may be able to tell by the genre name, but if you listen to their shit, it's pretty fucking heavy. Another example of why Relapse is one of the best damn labels the metal genre has ever seen. (See also [Nile], [Mastodon], [Nasum] and [Pig Destroyer])
