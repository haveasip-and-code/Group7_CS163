middle age
The period of a person's life that falls between youth and wishing you would fucking die. For some the line between middle age and old age is very thin. ; Richard Nixon was born middle aged; [Madonna] achieved middle age when she became irrelevant; [Dick Cheney] bypassed middle age and went straight to old age as fast as he could get there.
