horse lips
A reference to a females labia (as in the lips of her vagina) which after years of abuse and over indulgence have developed their own motor skills and as such have become profoundly large. In many cases as can be witnessed in the terminal bar whore variety the horse lips can be visible dangling pursed below the hem of many a mini-skirt slavering,rictused waiting for a meal. Some accounts mention an event where an extremely distended set of horse lips actually snatched a smothered burrito from a passing serving tray on it's way to a dismayed customer. Still other accounts warn of horse lips for they may hide horse teeth. A keen eye can spot horse lips on a pant clad woman...the horse lips will appear as two one pound slabs of liver jammed into the front pockets.
