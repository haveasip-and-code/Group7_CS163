starspeak
A new and unique language used by Hollywood film stars who often barely finished High School, and are now used to living in a mega-rich unreal world and being surrounded by sycophants and yes-men. Commonly used in answer to a personal or difficult question, it often features a mangling of metaphors in a weak attempt to sound deeper and more thoughtful (and less ego-centric) than the film star actually is - and rarely actually answers the question in a comprehensible way. Also known as celebspeak.
