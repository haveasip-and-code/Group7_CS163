videogamed
Verb: to be completely screwed by a videogame. Usually happens when the computer pulls some bullshit on you so they can win, or when your teammate who is a computer A.I. screws you over so that your friend who is on the other team wins. See also [steamy lincoln]. ; Also in games like HALO 2 when you melee an opponent 3 times on the head and they don't die and you lost rockets. ; Then the guy on the other team takes the rockets and kills the last three guys on your team for a Killtacular, that should never had happened in the first place, to win the game. F'in Bungie....oh yeah, EA GAMES sucks too.
