myv-kei
Myv-kei, also Miyavi-kei, is the style in which all [visual kei] artists attempt to look like [Miyavi] by styling themselves after him either by getting a lipring or just plain remodeling their faces so they can be a clone of him. ; Word is inspired by the fact that when flipping through an issue of [Cure] Magazine, you see so many people that look like Miyavi.
