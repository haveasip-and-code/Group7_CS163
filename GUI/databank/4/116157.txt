Sega Master System
First worldwide system released by SEGA in the states in 1986, also known as the Mark III in japan. It was graphically superior to the NES, and had way cooler peripherals, such as the fragile but still awesome 3D glasses. Instead of that crappy robot thing that shipped with the nes. But it was a doomed system in the states, due to nintendo's bully style marketing tactics. Though it did enjoy success in New Zeland, and especially Brazil, where they were still making games for it until 1997/8. And even made a girl's version of the SMS.
