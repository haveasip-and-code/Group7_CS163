Thai Stick
High quality marijuana bud that is wraped around a thick stem from a canabis plant with hemp rope. This is done to compress then buds and dry it at a slower pace then is done otherwise. This slow drying process allows for a greater potency of the marijuana. However, contrary to popular belief, it is NOT dipped in opium or some other drug.
