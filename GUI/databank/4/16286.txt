Valentine's Day
A commercialized holiday that is designed to make you and your 'significant other' fall in love even more. Or, gives you the opportunity to tell your 'crush' that you love them and what not. But really just ends up making 90% of the population depressed and lonely. Also causing a lot of girls to get typical gifts with no originality whatsoever because they advertise every girl wanting a rose and a box of chocolates.
