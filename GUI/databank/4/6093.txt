Twisted Heart
An occurence most commonly experienced by the feeling of unrequited love, with the exception of it not being returned. ; Generally speaking, it is a situation involving two friends, who spend an inexorbitant amount of time with each other, and over the years, one grows to love the other, while the opposites feeling stay plutonic. No pain compares, physical nor mental. ; A relationship easily broken off is not truly that of a twisted heart. Twisted heart involves never being able to make a clean cut, whether that might involve the other person feeling just as strongly as you but without the same passion. Refer to [just a friend]
