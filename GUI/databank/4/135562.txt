campbell river
A small city in the middle of vancouver island on its Eastern coast in British Columbia Canada. It used to be once known as 'the salmon capital of the world' until the salmon mysterioulsy dissapeared. the city, (known for partying because thats all there is to do here) contains a large healthy population of donkeys and skanks which seem to be doing better than the salmon because they are becoming predominatly more common. these skanks seem to have a lot of campbell river pride. when asked where they are from they answer 'campbell river, wanna giver?', campbell river may further been known as 'the donkey capital of the world' yet this still remains to be seen. Tim hourtons, local drug dealers, the Voodoo, bootlegger, and the real canadian superstore are its hot spots.
