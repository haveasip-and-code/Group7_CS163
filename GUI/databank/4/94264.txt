Landover Baptist
A fantastic parody site that pokes fun at ultra-conservative [fundamentalist] Christians. ; Recent articles include 'The Pope's Message From Hell' and 'Inside the Sick Mind of [George Lucas].' ; Hilarious, but also disturbing due to the fact that there are people out there who would probably wholeheartedly agree with the majority of the material on this site. ; http://www.landoverbaptist.org/
