stage combat
Theatrical choreography or improvisation that creates the illusion of physical combat without hurting the actors. Sometimes actors make no real physical contact when engaging in stage combat. When actual contact is made, care is taken to ensure punches and kicks land on sturdy muscle groups, while appearing to cause pain. One of the most dangerous contact moves is the face slap, which puts the ears, eyes, nose, and jaw at very high risk.
