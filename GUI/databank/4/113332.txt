Common typo among people who like to insert many exclamation points to the end of a sentence, caused by accidentally releasing the Shift key before the 1 key, and sending the message without previewing it to realize the typo had been made. ; Often used on purpose to make fun of such accidents and the people who make them, or as part of leetspeak. ; A similar but less-joked-about occurrence is the tendency to insert backslashes after a string of question marks.
