jane fonda
an incredibly talented actress and great person. daughter of henry fonda and sister of peter fonda. you may have seen her in klute, 9 to 5, barbarella, the china syndrome, fun with dick and jane, barefoot in the park, on golden pond or coming home, as well as many others. in addition to films, she's quite the liberal activist who isn't afraid to stand up for what she believes in. jane rocks!
