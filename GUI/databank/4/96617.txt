Electrobix
A song by [Scissor Sisters], (the greatest modern disco-rockers ever!), which talks about peer-pressure induced homophobia, and promotes the whole 'gay workout' routine. It is one of the [Scissor Sisters]' older songs, though a fan-favourite. It is not found on the band's self-titled debut album, although it can be found on the unofficial Scissor Sisters 'Remixed!' album. (You can also download it on P2P file-sharing programs such as [KaZaA])
