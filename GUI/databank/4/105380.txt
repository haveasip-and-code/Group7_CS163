Mets
A New York baseball team. Often reffered to using acronyms such as 'My Entire Team Sucks', or 'Most Exciting Teaim in Sports'. A decent team that plays at Shea Stadium, and get off their backs Yankee fans, theese guys bust their asses to play; at least they have fans who know what the hell they're talking about.
