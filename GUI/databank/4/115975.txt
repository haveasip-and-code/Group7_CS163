run (it)
(verb phrase) to become inebriated, i.e. drunk; similarly, the phrase can be used to describe an intended action ('i'm gonna run that'; 'i wanted to flirt with her, but then i decided that i didn't want to run that'); the second example shows a possible connection with the known phrase [run game]
