yuppie
A term which might have a lot of negative connotations attached to it, but really only means what it stands for - Young Urban Professional. In other words, it's anyone who is over twenty and under forty, lives in an urban environment and has a good career. This does most likely mean that they are fairly affluent, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're self-centered, obsessed with showing off, pissy if they don't start off every single day of their lives with a latte from Starbucks, or anything else like that.
