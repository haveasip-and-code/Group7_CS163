hopeship
A friendship between a male and female based only on the hope of getting with the other person. This type of relationship may include a series of break-ups and hook-ups. Usually only one of the friends is single. The hope must be mutal between both parties and neither friend acts on their feelings in a productive way. It is virtually the oppisite of friends with benefits and the comment 'we're just friends' must be made by both parties almost daily.
