skin bridge
A skin-bridge is formed when the raw remnant where the foreskin was cut attaches to the raw surface of the glans and heals that way. This happens after the doctor has lost interest in the case and the mother, who has been told her son's circumcised penis is now 'low maintenance' and has no idea what it is 'supposed' to look like, does not notice that anything is the matter
