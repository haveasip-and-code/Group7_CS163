intelligence
Intelligence is correlated to the ability to adapt to different environments and circumstances. The higher the intelligence, the easier it is to deal with ambiguity, incomplete information, and to make intuitive leaps in logic that turn out to be productive and right. The lower the intelligence, the less likely it is to adapt to change and the less likely it is for that organism to be successful in the new and changing environment.
