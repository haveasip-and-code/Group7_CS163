harajuku girl
originates from japan. Harajuku girls have a very original style. They often mix and match a lot of different styles using things they bought from charity shops and very high priced designer clothes lines. It's extreme, surreal and super cute. Gwen Stefani is a huge fan- She's made songs about Harajuku and is even bringing out a Harajuku clothes line called L.A.M.B. (love angel music baby)
