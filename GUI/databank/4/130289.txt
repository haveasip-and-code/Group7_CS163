Gutterbugs
The few thugs who can back up the trash they throw around. Annoying, rude, like cockroaches with the way they multiply and persistantly show up, even after being beaten to a pulp time and again. ; Usually carry butterfly knives, but some 'evolve' to such a point where they walk around with a handgun tucked into the back of their pants, which they cannot fire with any accuracy, but still dangerous nonetheless.
