Bad Beat
Losing a hand in poker that you from the beginning are very probable to win. Often (or so it will seem) to a worse player, who called you bet when the odds were clearly against him/her. ; Novices often confuse a bad call with a call that will probably lose, but still has the [pot odds] on its side. They will then moan and moan about getting bad beaten when in fact they were only slightly unlucky. A bad beat is in fact when someone makes an incorrect move against you, and gets extremely lucky.
