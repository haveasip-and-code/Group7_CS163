liberal christian
A follower of the Christian church (any of them, since there are about 30 different denominations) that supports liberal ideology including but not limited to pro-abortion, sex whenever between any 2 legal adults, stem cell research, pro-legalization, anti-war movements, and, most importantly, the two things that set them apart from the Christian Right: FREEDOM OF RELIGION and SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE, which if you'll remember is written and implied in the Constitution. Needless to say, there aren't too many out there, and most of them are really just moderates in the political spectrum.
