BCA
A magnet school in NJ that fucks you over when you realize you work your ass off for four years, but still aren't going to get into an IVY bc the kid right next to you is on the U.S. Team for the 36th International Chemistry Olympiad. But thats just ONE example... I could just ramble on and on........competition is cut-throat, resulting in a serious case of Senioritis and burn out.
