Poona!
An expression of or vulgar form of greeting referring to the genitalia. Invented by Jason Moore and Matt Denn. Often associated with the similar but less insulting [Woodgie Woodgie Wee!] and [Oumpa] which is derived from the noises that my brother made whilst placing parts of our pet dachshunds in his mouth such as their ears and pulling back and forth.
