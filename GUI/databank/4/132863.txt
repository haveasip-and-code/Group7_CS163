whooshka
the word would be described as: a word yelled spontaneously in reaction to an over-enjoyment of a simple action. this word is derived from three random friends living deep in baton rouge, louisiana. one day, they were walking down the street and as one of them got the urge to jump off of the curb, she yelled a completely random word 'whooshka'
