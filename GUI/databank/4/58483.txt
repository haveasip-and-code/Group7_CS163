Council Bluffs
The entire size of this town could fit into North Omaha. The perfect, 'Once you cross the Railroad tracks' town where most people dont understand there is some nice areas to it, but no one typically drives past the gridlock west end of town. Our crime is a hell of a lot lower than omaha, but everyone goes to the Big O on the weekends because there is nothing here to do that you cant do that plus some more, besides strip clubs.
