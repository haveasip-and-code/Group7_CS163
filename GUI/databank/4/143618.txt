pop-punk
Pop: fads that are popular or mainstream, including music. ; Punk: an movement of people and fads that go against what is popular and mainstream. ; Pop-punk: stupid not-tallented bands like good charlotte and blink. they sound punky, but are corprate sell outs and therefore CANNOT by definition be punk at all. The entire point of punk is to be reafreshingly defferent from the mainstream of pop. So you can't mix them.
