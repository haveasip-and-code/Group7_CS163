tommy hilfiger
An American designer that started out unknown and unsure as to how big he would become. As it turns, out, most everyone has heard of Hilfiger. Unfortunately, he charges rediculous prices for his products, which are of poor quality. Unlike other designers whom have the highest of quality and one-of-a-kind designs, Hilfiger is nothing more than poor quality, urban clothes, that are annoyingly-plastered with 'Tommy' or 'Tommy Hilfiger' all over it. His lack of design variation (he seems to think red, white, and blue is utterly original) has made his products extremely boring. After the first two years or so, everything he's produced since is the same as the last, making fashion critics skeptical as to what his fans find so amazing about his designs (or lack thereof), and why people choose to wear his tasteless urban trash.
