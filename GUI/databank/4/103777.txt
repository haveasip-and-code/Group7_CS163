libertarian communist
[by negation]1. One who does not strive to create situations or at least institutions that encourage the practice of maiming, imprisoning or dispossessing others. ; 2. One who rests in the belief that an 'organic' and 'natural', though multi-national, community is suppressed by any number of incomprehensibly abstract laws and economic strictures. Such a community generally is not a community by contract, but is yet comprised of voluntarists.
