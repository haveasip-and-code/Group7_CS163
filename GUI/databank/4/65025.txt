cal poly
usually where most of the [UC-Berkeley] engineering rejects go - don't deny the fact that Cal is still years ahead of you in engineering and science ; Cal's [EECS] program >>>>>>>>>>>> any other school's similar program, except for maybe MIT ; Cal's Haas School of Business >>>>>>>> * ; Average GPA and SAT score of admitted EECS applicants: 4.45 and 1460, 4.0+ and 1400+ for engineering applicants overall, whereas cow poly's at 3.87 and 1280. ; that, and the area near cow poly's kennedy library smells like shit - at least we don't have to worry about having an ag department
