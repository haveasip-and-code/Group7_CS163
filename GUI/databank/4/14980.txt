Hewlett Packard
Crappiest Computer Company ever. after a few years, the computer will have hardware problems. Your Laptop won't charge due to broken power socket or your CD Burner on your desktop starts to make funny noises. They are also hard to upgrade because wires are everywhere so it's hard to upgrade your memory, harddrive, etc.
