Illinois Wesleyan University
Illinois Wesleyan University, or IWU (pronounced eye-woo), is a small liberal arts university in Bloomington, Illinois that consists of about 2500 students. ; IWU is in close proximity to Illinois State University, so often there is a sense of rivalry between students at each institution. The high cost of attending IWU makes some students at ISU believe that everyone at IWU is obscenely rich. However, contrary to this popular belief nobody at IWU pays for college in cash and almost all students at IWU get some kind of scholarship/financial aid package that makes the cost much more managable.
