T.U.F.T.
The Ugly Friend Theory. girls travel in groups. there is almost always (90% of the time) an ugly girl in a group of 3 girls or more. it is unusual to find that all 3 (or however many) are hott, or even attractive. as the number of girls increases so does the possibility that there will be an ugly girl or ugly girls.
