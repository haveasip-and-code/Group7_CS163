Durban poison
Probably the strongest weed you will ever have heard of, smoked, eaten, or whatever, you can't go wrong with that sh!t! ; the good strain has a red tinge to the leaves, and the slightly cr@ppier version has a brown tinge. they are both insanely strong, and are grown in South Africa, the best country in the world
