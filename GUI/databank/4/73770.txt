Bryn Mawr
The ultimate in all female education in Baltimore, MD. A school where you may be paying for a single sex education but actually spend all of your time at Gilman's boys school across the street. Your teachers will test you harder than most college professors and you will pay more every year for the torture. A school built on a tradition of excellence through academics, athletics, and friendship. [Notre Dame Prep] thinks that they have the market on spring school wide gym event gatherings but one stop at Bryn Mawr on the 1st Saturday in May will tell you that our tradition is a century old and getting stronger as it ages. With their well connected and prosperous alumnae (who don't need to attach themselves to husbands because they are smart enough to make their own money), gorgeous hotties enrolled at the school and amazing achievments recognized nationwide one thing is for certain; Many will imitate but NONE can duplicate the best. ; PS: Did we mention that we are eloquent too?
