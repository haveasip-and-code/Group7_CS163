UCS
Acronym for 'United Civilized States'. One of the three playable factions in the games 'Earth 2140' and 'Earth 2150'. The futuristic version of today's United States of America. The UCS army consists of unmanned mech units all controlled by a massive super computer that eventually gets hacked into during the campaign in 'Earth 2150'. Fortunately, a backup program was installed to ensure their victory against the [ED]. The UCS's arsenal is somewhat advanced in that they use plasma cannons and a mess of rockets instead of cannons and lasers.
