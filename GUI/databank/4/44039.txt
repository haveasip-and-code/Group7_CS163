trinity collegiate school
When people hear the name Trinity Collegiate School, many things come to mind. Children of doctors, drugs, alcoholics, 15 year olds who drive mercedes, bmw's, and land rovers. Not only that, these kids are beyond spoiled. They never wear the same thing twice. To them, paying 150 bucks for a pair of jeans named after the number 7 is a 'great deal!' Daddy can do this and daddy can do that, its ridiculous.
