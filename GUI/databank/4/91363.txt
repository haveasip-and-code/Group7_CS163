mahu
Male crossdresser common to Hawaii, particularly the Chinatown district of Oahu. Mahu are on the streets to perform skin flute renditions for a price. Most mahu are pretty rough looking and could probably kick the shit out of you if provoked. ; Mahu are disliked by large local women because they buy up all the large size stylish shoes leaving only funky kine shoes that nobody like wear.
