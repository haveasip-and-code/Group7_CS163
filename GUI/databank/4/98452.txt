sl0wn
deriving from the popular phrase 'pwn', sl0wn translates as the exact same, but to a lesser degree. sl0wning occures when one dominates the other team, but it is not as spectacular as a perfect victory. (say, 1 to 100 would be pwn, 45-100 would be sl0wn). ; the litteral translation is 'slightly pwned'
