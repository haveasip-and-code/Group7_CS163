baisse
meaning 'drop' or 'fall', or also used as baisser, meaning 'to lean down or lean over.' It does not mean 'fuck,' as seen in [baise], which is also mispelled. Used with 'toi,' the word creates a command to someone to bend over to later engage in sex that has the connection of a sexual refrence, to which the word 'fuck' must have been incorrectly interpreted by others.
