Popular Sports Channel. Acronym that stands for Eastern Sports Promotion Network. Will usually see things like the latest Terell Owens coverage, drooling over Tom Brandy, the latest routene Derek Jeter play, the latest Manny Ramirez bitch fit, or why the ACC is better than all other conferences. Also has lame stories that try to prove sports worth when in all aspects it's just a game. Also made watching cards on T.V. popular. Also never stops covering the Chicago Cubs, Barry Bonds, LeBron James, Kobe Bryan/Phil Jackson, and Lance Armstrong (a.k.a. national fraud).
