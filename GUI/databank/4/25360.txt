jenny mccarthy
blonde 'celebrity' known for frequently posing naked in [playboy] magazine. She was extensively marketed as the 'next big thing' (read- shoved down people's throats by that entertainment industry), much as [paris hilton]is today, with some entertainment/ celebrity news magazines devoting a whole page to a 'Jenny-O-Meter' indicating just how popular she was that month. ; Fortunately that faded fast, aided somewhat by her lack of acting talent, and now all she can do is occasionally take her clothes off. ; An appropriate treatment for those addicted to reading celebrity news magazines, however, is [shotgun suicide].
