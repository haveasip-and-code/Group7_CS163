conversational puma
A Conversational Puma is a loud and opportunistic member of a conversation. The 'puma' part comes from the person's tendency to 'pounce' on you when you are trying to tell a story with loud interjections like 'NO WAY' or 'I KNOW'. Though its debateable whether the conversational puma is truely interested in what you are saying or if he/she is just patronizing you, the story usually ends up being truncated for no other reason than to avoid being loudly interrupted. ; This word was recently pioneered on the radio program [Loveline] by [Adam Carolla].
