Moss Rartin
The Fuhrer of all those who have been made fun of over the years. HE is their leader and will one day rally them to come back and destroy us. However, he still enjoys the pleasures of such fun games as Pokemon, Pick-up Sticks, jacks, marbles and a plethora of adult toys. His main occupation is taking care of his grandmother. She can be found at any time wandering around the arcade and mumbling to herself about moss' shortcomings. Nonetheless, we still, um, hate him.
