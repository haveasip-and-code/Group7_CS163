netosterone
Netosterone, derived from the compound of 'Net Testosterone.' Anything that you can relate to male adolesence, including sexual arousal and the need to 'prove oneself' only put on the internet. You can act like a hardass all you want online, but odds are if you said shit like that to that person in real life you'd get your ass laid out.
