EFDIS
'Every Fucking Day, I swear.' ; Origin.... ; EFDIS is a term invented by the late 'Firestar46' of the 1up EGM forums. It was coined amidst a backdrop of multiple threads making claims that the gaming company, [Nintendo], was going bankrupt, going the way of the dreamcast, and possibly going third party. The threads were extremely common and Firestar46 would often say 'Every fucking day, I swear [ that these threads on Nintendo going bankrupt are here ]' Eventually he shortened this to the acronym of EFDIS. Nooblets, or rookies to the message board, often think it is a way of saying 'Eff this' as if to imply [fuck] this.
