Velar Nasal
The sound made in the English words with the ''-ing'' suffix. In most accents this sound is also used in ''sing'', ''ring'', ''morning'', ; ''bring'', ''bang'', ''song'', ''rung'',''sting'', ''string'', ; ''greeting'' etc. But in my Scots dialect they are pronounced with a uvular nasal distinct from the velar nasal.
