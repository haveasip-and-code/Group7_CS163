Mrs. G'd
To get Mrs. G'd- verb. When you are tying to get laid by one female in a group of chicks, but one of the women, usually the sober or ugly one, acts as the voice of reason, and puts the kibosh on the whole deal. Just as Mrs. Garrett would do on the Facts of Life to most likely the slutty ones.... Jo or maybe Blair. Probably would not be a factor in the life of the fat one, Natalie!
