haha claws
Play on the words 'baja claws', a brand of off road tire. These are the tires mounted on a [brodozer], the chosen ride of the desert [bro]. These tires are massive in size, and prestine in appearance, due to the fact that they never see off road conditions. They are often jet black, glazed in tire gloss, and unevenly worn due to bad toe in from cheap lift kit installations.
