Jelqing
The correct medical slang for exercising one's penis for both enlargement in size and girth. Requires a man to basically jack off for 20 minutes, 3 times a week, while maintaing a non erect penis, and no money shot. Surprisingly it does work, but sadly like all exercise of any muscle it requires hard work, repetition, and daily showers (*wink*).
