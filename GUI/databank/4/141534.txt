Medfield  MA
A town in Mass. with a crappy high school with way way too many bad teachers and too many druggies/drunks. There are too many pizza places and banks in town. That's about all. The center of town is called 'uptown' no matter what. Even though there actually is a concept for using uptown/downtown but this town is in a bubble. I Wish I never moved here and everybody thinks it is great and wants to move here because they only see the big happy outside picture. ; Everyone in town is too focused on money, so you are kind of screwed if you are middle class or under. You will make it if you are rich and just about every prick here is. ; Everyone here is in a bubble. They think the world is perfect. They don't even pay any attention to the news at all. There parents are all conservative stuck up a-holes. Medfield is about the only republican town in Massachusetts. ; These are my honest feelings of this hell hole of a town. ; 'I am George Bush and I approve this Mess'
