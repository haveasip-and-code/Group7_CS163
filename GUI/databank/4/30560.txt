cuddlecore
Originally used to jokingly describe the sound of Vancouver, BC punk band cub (sic) and coined by friend Nicolas Bragg. It was meant to be an antithesis to the crotch-rock/clit-rock/riot grrrl/foxcore bands of the early-mid 1990's such as L7, Hole, Bratmobile, The Muffs, et al. Incorrectly used to describe the sound and fashions of other bands.
