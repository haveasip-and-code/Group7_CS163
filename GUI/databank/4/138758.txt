Sob stopper
A small present of little value which is acquired on the way home by a thoughtful man who has drunk too much and stayed out too late, in the hope of stopping his missus turning the fucking waterworks on. Examples include cheap chocolates bought from all night garages and bunches of flowers stolen from cemeteries.
