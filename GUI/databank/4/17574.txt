Aka. [Shitestar]. ; A mediocre [Emo] band, consisting of [Charlie Simpson] (Ex-[Busted]) and some of his mates. ; Vaguely talented, but completely blighted by Simpson's pretentious attitude. ; Since leaving [Busted], Simpson has allegedly been heard to frequently utter (from beneath his over-straightened mop) 'It's all about the music'. Whatever.
