jockspeak
A series of grunts and other ape-like noises that only jocks seem to understand. On first encounter, the 'conversation' may sound perfectly normal. However, on closer inspection, you realize that these 'words' only have meaning to the speakers, and aren't really even worthy of being called 'words'. ; Translation of jockspeak can be very difficult without an interpreter (preferably a former jock).
