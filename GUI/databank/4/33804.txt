abercrombie & fitch
abercrombie & fitch = amazingly cool clothes .. you DON'T have to be an airhead or rich to wear them either .. abercrombie & fitch shirts are totally adorable/funny & they AREN'T that expensive.. jesus quit complaining!!! i live with my single mother & younger brother & she manages to keep us both dressed in A&F threads. they're clothes are in style, cute, & quality.. plus wearing A&F is like a symbol - if you see a dope kid in the mall wearing 'JOE BOXER' you won't even care about him but if you see a decent kid wearing A&F you'll be all over that - BE LOOKED OVER ; NOT OVERLOOKED! - so save your nickels or whatever you got to do.. & BUY SOME AMAZING CLOTHES FROM ABERCROMBIE!!!! ; p.s. - i just bought some wicked cute jeans there for only $120 & an awesome sweatshirt for $70.. cute outfit = $190?? DUDE THAT'S A DEAL!! ; && that whole bit about having to be anorexic to wear there clothes? uhh nooo not true!! i'm a C cup & i'm not what you would consider anorexic..but they're clothes still fit & look great!
