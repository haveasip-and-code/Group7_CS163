the 'friends' talk
I have to give this talk to a guy about every week when I am single. It goes like this: 'I really like you, but I have so much going on in my life right now... can we hang? Be friends? Or is it the sort of thing where you don't want anything to do with me if you can't make sweet love to me?' What I mean by it is: You are nice. but you are kind of creepy and I don't think you are physically attractive. Which usually has to do with hygene or lack thereof.
