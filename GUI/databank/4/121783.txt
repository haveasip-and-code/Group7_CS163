V-Town
The former reference to the City of Vallejo. Pioneered by North Bay underground Rapper 40 water aka Fonzerelli Bellafonte aka Earl Stevens aka E 40. Now dubbed 'The Block'(for its numerous city blocks of clicks), V-Town is seldom used by Vallejo citizens, but will remain a retired classic that will always hold the weight of the home of The Crest (Cuddiville), The Ville, The South, Rancho, Hillcrest, T.T. West (Tree Town), Sea Side, Lofas, The Hills, Simmerons (Good Crest), College Park, Terrace Park and Beverly Hills.
