Noob Combo
A powerful weapon combo in the hit Xbox game, Halo 2. To perform it, a player finds a [Plasma Pistol] and [Battle Rifle], takes them, charges the Plasma Pistol and fires off a shot at the opponent, instantly making the target lose their shield. Then the player needs only to switch to the Battle Rifle and fire off one shot to the head (or two shots to the body) to get an instant kill on the target. ; It is widely used in maps like Colossus and Beaver Creek. Do not judge the combo by its widely-used name, however. It takes skill to some extent to aim the Battle Rifle in the right spot.
