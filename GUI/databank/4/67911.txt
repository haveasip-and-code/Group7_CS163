Pringles Theory
Named after the Pringles slogan, 'Once you pop, you can't stop,' this theory says that the longer someone waits to lose their virginity, the more they actively seek sexual activity once they do lose their virginity. The term 'Pringles Theory' was first used by Michael LaFerney in a paper to describe this phenomenon commonly occuring in undergraduate students.
