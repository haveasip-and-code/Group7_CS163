Ninjutsu
Developed in the 16th century during the Feudal era of the Japanese, it was created to combat the ever rising threat of the samurai. The art was specifically created to target weak joints within armour with a concentration of a high powered blow. ; Now practically useless, it is used by morons who think that being a ninja is cool, when in reality, Chinese wushu owns everyone.
