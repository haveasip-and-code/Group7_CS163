zanpakutou
A sword weilded by a Shinigami(or Death God), to defeat and judge Hollows. Also used in combat against many other things, such as 'Kwin-Shi'(or perhaps, Quincy)s, and other Shinigami. A Zanpakutou(or Soul Slayer) can awaken to it's true form once the Shinigami has ventured inside themselves to find their sword's, and perhaps their own soul's, true identity and name.
