new hyde park
short for Not Happy Place. ; a town in the middle of long island, new york. probably one of the most boring towns in America. there's absolutely nothing to do hear-the epitome of suburbia. its just a few strip malls, a golf course, schools, pizzeria's, a park or two, etc. not that exciting. i'd say 85% of the people are either indian or italian. there's no middle school, just 4 elementary schools and one 'high' school. everyone's extremely rascist and judgmental. this place sucks and as soon as i turn 18 i'm getting the fuck outta here...
