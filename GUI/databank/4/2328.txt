Jeremy Clarkson
A great man who has the best opinions and an amazing way of saying things with a huge amount of metaphors, is firmly against going slower than 120mph and speed cameras, once had his own chat show called Clarkson but was recieved too much hate mail for the sheer amount of abuse he spewed.
