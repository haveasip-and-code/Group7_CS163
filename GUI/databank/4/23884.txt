Cheetahmen 2
An unlicensed NES game made by Active Enterprises, which was a sequel to [Action 52]'s 52nd game, known as Cheetahmen. It's just as buggy and glitch-ridden as its predecessor. Cheetahmen was Active Enterprises' attempt to cash in on the fame of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and turn people away from the green heroes, but it failed.
