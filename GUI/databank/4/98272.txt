archaeology
1. (What archaeology should be) You've started your archaeology course. It's the first day, you have your hat, whip and [designer stuble] and are ready to go and kick ass. Everything is exciting, there are always [nazi] scum to shoot, imprisoned children to free and [artefact] s to 'rescue'. If you are an archaeologist you can also get [laid] easily. ; 2. What archaeology is :( . You're there, on your uni course, let's say in Exeter for example. Pen in hand. Peering around the [lecture] theatre at various other [odd] looking characters that look like they should never have been allowed to leave [wales] , [sommerset] or whatever random back country they escaped from. There's hours of looking at dendrochronology, pollen diagrams, and geophysical [bull shit]. (That's not the good kind of [pollen] either :( ) Archaeology causes insanity, a strong accent and excitement over broken [ceramics] . ; Avoid at all costs. Unless you are already displaying archaeology symptoms, then you may well enjoy.
