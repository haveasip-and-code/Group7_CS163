cardboard crack
Magic cards. ; No, really. Cards from the Magic: The Gathering game. So called because, like crack, they are cheap but highly addictive and you never ever stop buying more, even when it's harming your job, your social life, and your health. ; The term can be expanded to refer to any collectible card game, but Magic remains both the first and the best of these.
