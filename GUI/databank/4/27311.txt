Was once Hicksville until all the little townspeople fucked and made babies, and now its a mix between wannabe novi preps and poser punks, along with a whole load of old people who complain all damn day because of all the changes due to their own kids, and then write letters to the newspaper- thinking people actually read that shit. Hey if you dont like it here, MOVE DUMBASS!!!!!!
