nadolig llawen
[Welsh] translation of 'Merry Christmas'. Lit. 'Christmas Merry', since the Welsh language, like many others, places most [adjective]s after the [noun]. ; The 'LL' in Llawen is intranscribable in [English], but is produced by pressing the front and sides of the tongue to the top of the mouth and simply exhaling, so a sound similar to the 'ttl' in [settle], but without the harsh 'T' sound, is produced.
