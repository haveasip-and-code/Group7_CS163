'77 kids
People that listen to classic punk aka 1977 punk, which in England punk became an explosion at the time. Bands include Neon Hearts, Dead Boys(US), Eater, Vibrators, Johnny Thunders ect. These kids listen to '77, and most of the time glam and powerpop. ; The type of style they go for is usually choppy hair cuts (sometimes might resemble a mullet), and random bleached spots in their hair. They usually stand out from any other ordinary punk.
