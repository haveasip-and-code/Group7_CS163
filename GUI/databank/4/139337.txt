Ramizzle
Ramen Noodles - Ghetto style ; If you're too lazy to cook them in water.. or if you don't have running water, a pot to cook them in and your gas or electricity was shut off... YOU CAN STILL ENJOY THEM. ; Take a bag of ramen noodles (Top Ramen is the best known). Crunch them up in the bag, shake it, smash it, pulverize it if you like... just don't break the bag. ; Then take the flavor packet.. pour it over the broken bits, close up the bag and shake it again... you end up with something akin to potato chips, only it's delicious raw ramen!
