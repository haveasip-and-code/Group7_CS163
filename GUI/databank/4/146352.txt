Diving for Dollars
When you are traveling globally, abroad, internationally, etc... and realize that your debit or credit card doesn't work due to 'network problems', or you lost your wallet the night before and have to wait a week to have new cards sent out. You have to raid all of your pockets, wallets, dirty laundry, purses and man bags to dig up enough to have a big night out. This is high end dumpster diving.
