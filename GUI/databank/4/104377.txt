Winston Churchill
In my opinion, he was the greatest Prime Minister [England] ever had. He was responsible for the deaths at [Gallipoli] but he helped England through some its toughest times, I beleive he won [World War II]for england. He forged bonds which help today with many countries such as the USA. He also got a Nobel Peace Prize for literature and many other Prestigous Awards.
