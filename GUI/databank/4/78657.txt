red deer
Red Deer is a small city situated in the heartland of Alberta. Don't let this fool you; Red Deer is not a place where you are anyone else should take pride in living in or visiting. Often people are sent to work in this waste land for countless days on end, making difficult for there family and friends. What kind of company name is BJ Serves Inc. anyways? Red Deer's population mainly consists of dirty Red Necks opposed to harder working, cleaner, smarter and much richer Rough Necks living in the northern parts of Alberta. Red Deer is a horrible slum of a community.
