Cortlandt Manor  NY
A reasonably large town that manages to hold some of the wealthiest people in Westchester county but contributes nothing to society other then a small resteraunt that recently went out of business and a Town Center that's actually located in Mohegan Lake. The Town Center itself is nothing to be proud of because it mearly harbors the towns social and scholarly rejects who cannot find a better way to entertain themselves on any night of the week then hang out in front of Barnes and Noble and get messed up on whatever drugs they can find. Rich socialites who can't afford to live in Bronxville or Chappaqua move here thinking it will be a good place to raise their children. Obviously they are greatly mislead. This town is better defined as the Boondocks of upper westchester.
