As I Lay Dying
Prior to this, a novel by William Faulkner chronically the Bundren family after the passing of Addie Bundren, as they try to bring her body back to her hometown and into the dirt she desired. The story is told piecemeal through short bits of alternating first-person narration. While it's no Sound and the Fury, its a bit more urban, since at some point they do arrive in a city...or town maybe.
