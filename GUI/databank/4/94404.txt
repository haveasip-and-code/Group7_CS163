mise
a. (verb) To obtain something good, especially in a manner that is fortunate and/or timely. ; b. (noun) Something obtained in this manner. ; Coined by players of the popular TCG (Trading Card Game) Magic: The Gathering, the term is derived from the phrase 'might as well' and originally applied only to cards [topdeck]ed exactly when most needed. It has since expanded in meaning to include pretty much anything lucky, unexpected, though the primary meaning remains the same. ; Usually used only by TCG players, especially Magic players.
