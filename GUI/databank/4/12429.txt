neo-fascist
Neo-fascism replaces the centralized authority of a dictator with a government voted into power by means of fraudulent elections. Neo-fascism follows in the goosesteps of Mussolini but legislates economic controls to enable corporate domination of the world market. Suppression of the opposition through intimidation and censorship, and a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism are achieved through [hegemonic] control of popular entertainment and mass media. These persuade citizens that wars and the suppression of individual rights paradoxically corroborate the ideology of individualism.
