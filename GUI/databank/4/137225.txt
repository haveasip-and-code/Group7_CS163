Long Hill
A combination of four towns located in Central-Northern New Jersey. Long Hill is filled with the worst police force on the planet. They sit around and play computer games and eat cookies all the livelong day. Be careful if you're black and driving through Long Hill, you're bound to be pulled over. This township is composed of close minded white people. Half are rich..half aren't so rich. Our schools are poor. Our teachers park in our parking spaces. Everyone here is fake, so don't trust them. Oh, and watch out for those soccer moms in their huge SUVs. If you're a mom and you don't have one, you're so not 'in' around here. People around here are sheltered. Some don't know what the word gay means. And it's republican central. You'll know you're in Long Hill if you notice everyone has the same taste in music and clothing. Talk about trend central. ; See [close minded white communities].
