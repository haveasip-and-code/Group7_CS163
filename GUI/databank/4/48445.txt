destiny
Life is not merely a series of meaningless accidents or coincidences. But rather it's a tapestry of events that culminate in an exquisite sublime plan. If we are to live life in harmony with the universe, we must all possess a powerful faith in what the ancients used to call fatum, what we currently refer to as destiny.
