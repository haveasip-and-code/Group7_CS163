diplomabam!
A word used to describe failed [diplomacy]. Derived from the combination of 'diplomacy' and 'bam!' Before diplomacy is completed successfully, it is halted and discontinuted as the result of a violent act, thus the 'bam!' sound which is reminiscent of the sound that a fist punch made in old comics.
