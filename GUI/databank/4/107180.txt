gfw
An acronym for Gun Fearing Wussies. Usually a political Liberal, hippy (former or current) or [treehugger] who believes that the cause of all violence is firearms (as opposed to the belief that violence is caused by violent people). ; GFW's are usually the loudest in trying to outlaw ownership of personal weapons, as they believe that there is no reason to own a firearm.
