Liskeard
Small town in South East Cornwall, abandoned some time in the late 90's and now completely under the control of chavs. Notable only for the absence of any decent pubs or indeed anything you would want to see. Cornishmen be warned: visiting Liskeard may put you at risk of seeing a Plymouthian, or even a lost emmet looking for 'The Pipe Well' (poor deluded fools).
