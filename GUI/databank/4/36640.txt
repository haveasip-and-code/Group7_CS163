Damn Nazi
Originating from Miami Springs Senior High describing the current school administration and the principal Mr. Rodriquez (also refurred as Rodritler). This dictator raped and tore the once famed Miami Springs Senior to a hellish school where students are emberassed and ashamed to admit they go there. Rodriquez is known for taking students out of class for wearing the wrong color shirt. ; So, because of this man, the word 'Damn Nazi!' was created and its other forms include the plural 'Damn Nazis!' After this it sprung out and soon pictures emerged with his head put on hitlers body and even an online store came out with Anti-Rodriquez Products.
