nascar knuckledragger
Any fan of the Non Athletic Sport Centered Around Rednecks. Can easily be spotted by their hilariously gaudy NASCAR themed clothing, the NASCAR stickers with which they emblazon their overpowered vehicles, their overly aggressive driving, their mustaches (on both men and women) and their eyes, which are unnaturally close together due to inbreeding. They tend to parrot right wing views but can rarely be bothered to actually vote.
