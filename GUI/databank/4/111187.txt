cute as a bug's ear
cute in a family way; the way Homer Simpson describes Lisa Simpson to her in 'Lisa the Beauty Queen' in season 4 of the Simpsons, one of the [sweet]est shows ever. for a female to say about an unrelated male would be to call that guy completely [queer]. for a guy to say about an unrelated girl would be for the boy to call himself completely [gay]. for a male to call a related male cute as a bug's ear would be messed up.
