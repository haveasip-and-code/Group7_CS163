Unionville High School
The opposite of [Kennett] aka smart, rich, white kids who have their own cars and plan on going to expensive colleges in VA and the Northeast. You can count the # of minority kids on one hand, and you'd need about 67 hands to count the # of expensive-ass cars in the parking lot. But the girls are pretty, the student body actually is intelligent, and the rivalry between Kennett and Unionville is probably the strongest of any two high schools.
