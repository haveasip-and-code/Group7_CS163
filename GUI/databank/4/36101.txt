Bleach
The first album realeased by Nirvana. It was recorded for around $600 for the relatively new record label Sub Pop. All in all, it only ended up selling 35,000 copies, and those mostly around their native Seattle. Some diehard nirvana fans claim it is their best abum, others say that it shows promise but is not that great. Also, it is their only album before Dave Grohl became the bands drummer. ; It has a much more raw sound than Nevermind, and overall is more true to the spirit of grunge.
