Toonces
The greatest cat of all-time. Toonces, the cat who could drive a car (just not very well), premiered on Saturday Night Live on May 20th, 1989, and was a series semi-regular up until 1993. Known for his appalling driving record, Toonces, in a written document, claims his abominable driving skills are due to a brain injury sustained while working as a stunt man on the Dukes of Hazzard. Accidents include driving cars, trucks, tractors, etcetera off God knows how many cliffs, veering off the Grand Canyon, some catastrophic event involving a mechanical bull, crashing a UFO into the Washington Monument, and who knows what else. Likely in NASCAR today, probably having caused ten times the original season record number of crashes in one race by now.
