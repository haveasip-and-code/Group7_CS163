rolex
The infamous luxury watch known for it's extremely high price, constant replication, and continuous second hand. Rolex's are often considered to be the mark of a nouveu-riche, or new money. These people often like to overspend and show off their money by buying flashy clothes and jewelry. People who have had money for a long time tend to buy watches that are much more expensive but look like ordinary watches.
