T Dot
A uneducated persons way of saying Toronto, often used by young white suburban middle class homosapians who mix ebonics into the everyday vocabulary because they want to (a)act like they are from the ghetto.... ; (b)act like they are black ; (c)think they are real gangsters because they commit petty crimes and think they can intimedate people by talking like that but often get beaten down by the real gangsters when found using such vocabulary.......
