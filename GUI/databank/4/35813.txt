Gonorrhea Lectim
This disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior. The disease is called Gonorrhea Lectim. Many victims have contracted it after having been screwed for the past 4 years, in ; spite of having taken measures to protect themselves from this especially troublesome disease. Congitive sequelae of individuals infected with Gonorrhea Lectim include, but are not limited to: ; Anti-social personality disorder traits; delusions of grandeur with a distinct messianic flavor; chronic mangling of the English language; ; extreme cognitive dissonance; inability to incorporate new information (pronounced xenophobia); inability to accept responsibility of actions; ; exceptional cowardice masked by acts of misplaced bravado; uncontrolled facial smirking; ignorance of geography and history; tendencies toward creating evangelical theocracies; and a strong propensity for categorical, all or nothing behavior. The disease is sweeping Washgton. Naturalists and epidemiologists are amazed and baffled with this malignant disease originated only a few years ago in a Texas Bush.
