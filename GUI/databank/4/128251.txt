pentecostal
A 'Christian' religious sect that meets all neccessary criteria for a cult (though that applies to a number of christian sects). This particular sect of mental patients beleive that females will burn in hell for a cutting their hair, wearing makeup, piercing their ears, or any other destructive, vain activities. All pentecostals are raised to beleive that any non-pentecostal will burn in hell for eternity, as will any pentecostal who has ever drank, smoked, said 'gosh', or missed church. This high level of logical thinking goes a long way in explaining why most pentecostals live in trailer parks and eat fried Spam for dinner (after, of course, they pray).
