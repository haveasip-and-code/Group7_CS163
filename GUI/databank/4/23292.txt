wikki
i posted the first 'wikki wikki wikki' thread on TF. ; the thread tital was going to be 'wack wack wack' but i knew that would not go over at all, so i used the Newcleus simulated turntable scratch word instead... ; the first post was going to be 'spin spin sugar' but for some reason i thought that was too harsh, even though the whole convesation went down in my own head... so i opted for: ; 'You spin me right round, baby ; Right round like a record, baby ; Right round, round, round' ; you see i was talking about the way a certain silly record executive (the one who gives us our fill of music with no soul, but i affectionately will call flipper) was spinning information in post he was making on the TF message board, or at least in his lablels e-mail updates that were finding themseves reposted on TF, i don't remember. ; needless to say i think its funny you kids still post 'wikki wikki' all over the place. even if very few people will ever know the subversive or therapeutic nature of the phrase.
