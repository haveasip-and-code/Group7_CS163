Cleveland Cavaliers
n. An NBA team in Cleveland, OH that has had their share of ups and downs in it's 35 years of existance. The likes of Michael Jordan usually dicking them over in the playoffs is mainly responsable for their bad luck in the playoffs in the 90s. Don't think we will ever win a championship but eventually will become contenders soon enough. Usually in a 'rebuilding year' if having a crappy season... as with all Cleveland sports.
