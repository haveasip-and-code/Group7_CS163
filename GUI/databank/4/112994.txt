parties
An excuse for kids to gather sketchily in someones basement, backyard, or parents living room drinking hard alcohol out of clear water bottles (as if people can't figure out that they aren't sipping Evian). There ofcourse are the regulars at every party. Theres always atleast 3 girls crying, the really high kid, the drunk girl everyones trying to control, the cracked out kids who sit on the couch in a daze, and the nerds who try really hard to blend in. Theres only like 5 really good parties a year becuase in [Fairfield County] kids prefer to either sit at the party talking about how gay it is or sit at home imagining how gay it would have been. Becuase they're too cool to take the risk of being at a 'gay party'.
