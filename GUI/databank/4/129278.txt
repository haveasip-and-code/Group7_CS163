Mud Sausage
In continuation of the slang term [mud], which means to do something in an uncoordinated matter (usu. in regards to athletics), the 'sausage' addendum designates the utmost degree (i.e. the nth degree) of uncoordination, ineptitude, 'sorriness', and any and all such definitive synonyms.
