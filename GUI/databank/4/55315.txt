American Muscle
A type of car that complete idiots that have no taste in cars drive. A car with a gas-guzzling engine, a really shitty suspension setup, a poorly designed chassis, and that is truly obsolete. People that drive these cars think that theyre fast because they beat stock honda civics, then they think that all imports cars are slow just cause they beat one stock honda civic.
