Final Fight
A video game that was very popular when first released in the arcades in 1989. Home versions were not as good as the arcade but some came close, such as the X680000 and Mega/SEGA CD versions. Numeruous seuqels appeared on the Super Nintendo and other consoles but all were inferior to the original. Some of the characters from the Final Fight series later made it into some of the Street Fighter games. ; One thing the first game is remembered for is that the upset two of the enemies caused to Nintendo. The characters Poison and Roxy were replaced in the Super Nintendo versions with Billy and Sid because Nintendo USA thought Posion and Roxy were transvestites. These characters were left in the Japanese version though. ; The game is in the scrolling beat 'em up genre, with your character walking around fighting anyone that dares to attack you. You have a few different moves in the original version (later games had many more moves) and special attacks. The enemies can get real tough later on, and there are often loads of them on screen as well. ; Despite being a very popular game back in the day, only 1 good fan site on the series now exists, located at www.classicgaming.com/finalfight
