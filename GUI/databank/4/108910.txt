Gordon's Vodka
Deliciously cheap vodka in a plastic bottle. The bottle even has a handle! Tastes like death but after the first two or three shots, well, you don't really care, do you. Interestingly enough, this is also when you stop caring about the 2005 election and start singing awesome '80s hair metal songs. Smells like nailpolish remover, probably tastes like it too, but for $12 a bottle how could you go wrong?
