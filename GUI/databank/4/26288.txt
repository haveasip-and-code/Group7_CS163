ebola
A disease in which the Zaire strain could totally own the entire fucking world. 90% casualty rate. it liquifies your collagen, so you skin basically will fall apart or become bruised very easily. It replicates and acts so quickly that you are dead within three weeks of contraction. You spew virus particles, and your blood runs black with the infection.
