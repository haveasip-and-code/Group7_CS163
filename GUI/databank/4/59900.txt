The South
1. A place where everyone wears a Larry the Cable Guy t-shirt and a Dixie Outfitter hat with one of those dumbass gold fish hooks on it. ; 2. A place where nobody finished high school because they were all too busy 'throwing in a fat one' and dreaming of that deer they killed from hundreds of yards away while hiding in a tree stand wishing slavery was still legal and listening to Garth Brooks drone on about how great beef jerky is. ; 3. A place where nobody ever learns to read.
