happinology
A belief system whereby The Good Samaritan's deed has its everlasting rippling effect, but the story is never written down, never spoken of, never mentioned. Developed in 2001 as a way to speak of good deeds done without going into the details of its doneness so as to avoid elevating the doer and thus minimizing the deed.
