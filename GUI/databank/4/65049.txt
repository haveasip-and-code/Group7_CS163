The act of being overly complicated bordering on smartassedness. Suggesting an improvement on a simple product such as an apple. 'dude this apple would be way better if they found a way to replace the seeds with naturally occuring caramel' ; these sorts of suggestions border on the strange and occasionally annoying and tend to benefit only that person, and no one else.
