Star Sonata
An awesome [MMORPG], set in space. It works nice on slow connections, and you don't have to pay if you don't want to. ; You get a ship. You can kill enemy ships for money, buy new parts or new ships, join a team, conquer galaxies, PvP, and some other very cool things. The goal of the game is to, literally, become emporer of the universe; when this happens, the universe implodes, and a new one is formed with all new places to explore (but you keep your ship and your level, so you don't have to start -completely- over).
