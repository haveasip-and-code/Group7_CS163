label
A word most teenagers don't know what it means. The real definition is 'a descriptive term; an epithet.' ; An epithet, for those of you who don't know, is 'A term used to characterize a person or thing, such as rosy-fingered in rosy-fingered dawn or the Great in Catherine the Great. ; A term used as a descriptive substitute for the name or title of a person, such as The Great Emancipator for Abraham Lincoln. ; An abusive or contemptuous word or phrase.' ; Now look closely at the sentence, 'An abusive or contemptuous word or phrase.' Isn't that what labels really are? ; Labels characterize people. Most people today think labels are basically cliques of people, but it's not. You can hang out with whoever you want, and still be considered a certain label. I dunno about you, but if you would just be yourself, a descriptive term would come up; (otherwise known as a label) INDIVIDUAL! You can't get away from labels. They're a part of life. Deal with it. ; -Constance
