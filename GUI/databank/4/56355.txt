JSRF
An acronym for the game Jet Set Radio Future, the latest installment in the Jet Set Radio games from Sega and what some consider to tbe the worst. It now comes bundled with Sega GT 2002 in every [X-box] you buy. You play as any of the characters from your rollerblade gang as you collect spray paint cans, design [tags], and battle the other gangs and the police. You spray [tags] and collect characters throughout the game.(this is vaguley similar to the 80's movie 'The Warriors')
