impeach
Just to clear things up for all those idiots out there who know shit about impeachment, TO IMPEACH A PRESIDENT IS NOT THE SAME AS PUTTING THEM OUT OF OFFICE. ; To impeach the President or another federal official is to bring a formal charge of wrongdoing against the. The accused then goes to trial with the Senate acting as a court. ; ACCORDING TO SECTION 4 OF ARTICLE II, NO PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES HAS EVER BEEN IMPEACHED. It is a common misconception and a very ignorant one at that. Both Clinton and Johnson were NOT impeached. It was not met to the full extent and by all rules on ANY accused president. ; I honestly hope some of you learned something out there. It's scary to think about how clueless some people are about the National Government.
