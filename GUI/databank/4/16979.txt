craccum
Craccum is the Latin transation for 'shit', or so I'm told (don't hold it against me if that's incorrect, I've got dodgy sources...). It's also the magazine put out weekly by Auckland University. If you can ever get your hands on it, read it. Certain conservative people with too many convictions (and fundamentalist right-wing christians) will probably find it highly offensive, but that's no reason for you not to read it. You can write outraged letters to the editor which will provide other readers with even more entertainment. The magazine is compiled of some very humourous and witty articles. The major reason I'm such a Craccum addict is because of the style and attitude that comes through from the writers. I would attempt to describe it but I'm sure I would just do it an injustice. The only way you you can see what I'm talking about is read it.
