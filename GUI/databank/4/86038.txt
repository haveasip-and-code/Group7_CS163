Kick the Pillow
1: to warn a person about something after it is far too late for them to do anything about it ; 2: to attempt (generally poorly and without success) to cover up something (often done at the time of the commission of the act which is to be covered up or immediately after) ; Etymology: 'Kick the Pillow' is derived from a practice of Feudal Japan. It was considered dishonorable to kill a sleeping enemy, so a warrior would kick his enemy's pillow in order to wake him just before chopping off his head. This allowed the warrior to maintain his honor (at least by the literal letter of the rules) while preserving the advantage of taking an enemy completely unawares.
