pumpkin bowling
about a week before Halloween, you go around and jack a bunch of un-carved pumpkins from in front of a bunch of houses...the bigger the better. Then, as the passenger of the car, you have the driver floor it and lean out of your window, your outer arm cradling the pumpkin and your other hand gripping the 'oh-shit' handle inside the car so you don't fall out. Once the car reaches a good speed (at least 40 mph) you roll the pumpkin in a bowling-type of fashion towards any target of your choice...preferably something expensive. Then just sit back and watch the show!
