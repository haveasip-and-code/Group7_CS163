God hates ...
The beginning of a phrase commonly used by Evangelical/Fundamentalist demonstrators outside of places where more socially progressive/non-Biblically sanctioned events take place, i.e. Planned Parenthood clinics and gay/lesbian pride parades. ; The term is seen by some as ironic, since some statement commonly made in Christianity is 'God is love.' or 'For God so loved the world...' or 'God loves all his children.' It would seem that although God may take opposition to certain acts, It (I think it's probably to big of a concept to really assign gender to) wouldn't really have the capacity for hate.
