artsy fartsy
Trying too hard to be artistic; an overly strong interest in appearing to be aesthetically aware. ; From a lyrical marriage of the words 'art' (creative or imaginative activity such as painting or poetry) and 'fart' (expelling gas). The implication is that the art (or person) in question is no more than a glorified fart.
