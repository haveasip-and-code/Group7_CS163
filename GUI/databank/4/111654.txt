peace sign
1)'The 70s' peace symbol ; A combination of the semaphore signals for the letters 'N' and 'D', standing for Nuclear Disarmament. In semaphore the letter 'N' is formed by a person holding two flags in an upside-down 'V', and the letter 'D' is formed by holding one flag pointed straight up and the other pointed straight down. These two signals imposed over each other form the shape of the peace symbol (coincidentally, considering the organization for which it was created, resembling a stylized, skeletal missile). In the original design the lines widened at the edge of the circle. ; 2)see [V Sign]
