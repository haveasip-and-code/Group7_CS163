indian
In Canada, it is a derogatory term for [First Nations] people, a people who lied before the whites came, took their land, brainwashed them into Christianity, made them second-class citizens, and forced them onto reserves. ; Although the word used to be quite polite, it has gone the way of the word '[negro]' and has become a highly offensive term. A much less offensive term is [native], and is the term of preference if you talk to someone of that culture without offending them.
