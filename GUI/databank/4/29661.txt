commitment
Commitment is what ; Transforms the promise into reality. ; It is the words that speak ; Boldly of your intentions. ; And the actions which speak ; Louder than the words. ; It is making the time ; When there is none. ; Coming through time ; After time after time, ; Year after year after year. ; Commitment is the stuff ; Character is made of; ; The power to change ; The face of things. ; It is the daily triumph ; Of integrity over skepticism.
