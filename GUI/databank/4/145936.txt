MUSHROOMS
Magic Mushrooms, or Shrooms, are a potent drug whose active chemicals are Psilocybin and Psilocin. Sensitive to heat and light. Common effects are dilated pupils, odd expression, and the distinct feeling of super thick chunks of broken light from the milky way intersecting the last thought of every cell in your body as the chair and ground and pizza and table slowly split open and melt.
