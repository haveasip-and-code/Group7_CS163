the stooges
After seeing the Doors in concert, James Osterberg A.K.A. Iggy Stooge (before he became Iggy Pop) was mesmerized by Jim Morrison and started his own band, the Stooges, which inspired alot of punk bands. The Stooges were a truly groundbreaking band and the godfathers of punk. They were fronted by Iggy Pop, a legend of punk and one of the greatest frontmen around.
