yeadon
Yeadon is small borough outside of Southwest Philadelphia. It is technically a suburb but the influx of city denizens has made this once small borough a growing urban spot. SEPTA, the major public transit authority in and around Philadelphia has a number 13 trolley entitles 'Yeadon,' named because the borough is the end of the line that travels from Center City throughout University City and West Philadelphia, through Southwest Philadelphia, into Yeadon, stopping on the Darby/Yeadon borderline.
