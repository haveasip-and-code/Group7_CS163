scotch
Most definitely does not mean 'Scottish' when describing people. It is often used to describe liquor, eggs and beef among other things. ; Those who call Scottish people 'Scotch' are often corrected with a polite saying-so, or a 'Fuck off, you stupid American bastard!', depending on how much Scotch the Scottish person has recently imbibed.
