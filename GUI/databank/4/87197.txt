indie pop
A sub genre of Indie Rock that includes music that is lighter and less depressing than most indie rock. Typically music you can jump or bob your head to, it is the opposite side of [indie] than [emo]. Because of its first-listen appeal, this is the music that your commercial radio listening friends end up buying after they have heard it in your car a couple of times.
