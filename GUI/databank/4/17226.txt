SLR
A type of camera, usually expensive, meaning Single Lens Reflex. It usually has a pentaprism for a mirror setup, and reflects exactly what you will see in the picture to the eyepiece, unlike cheaper cameras that do not do this. cheaper cameras usally havea little hole that goes through the camera across from the eyepiece that you look though.
