Wall of Death
Some time During the late 90s and early 2000s the famous metal band Lamb of Gods fans would traditionally form 2 walls facing each other, lower thier heads and charge straight into each other, carnage ensuing...they only did this during a certain song...which i cant recall at this moment the name of it at this moment.Long story short 8 people died, and the wall of death was forever banned in the USA
