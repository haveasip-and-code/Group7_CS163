Carlito Caribbean Cool
The coolest guy in wrestling. Cooler than the [Mexicools], cooler than Michelle McCool, and even cooler than Frankie Kazarian. Carlito is the only person on this God given green Earth that's allowed to judge another person's coolness. Why? Because he defines cool. ; Carlito is also the first man in [WWE] history to win each show's secondary titles in his debut matches. He defeated John Cena on his first night on [Smackdown!] to capture the United States championship, then on his first night on RAW eight months later, he pinned Shelton Benjamin to claim the Intercontinental championship. Now that's cool.
