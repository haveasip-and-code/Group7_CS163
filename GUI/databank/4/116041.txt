Muj
A slang term, popular amongst US troops like myself, referring to Iraqi or Afghani insurgents. Derived from the overused Arabic word, mujahideen, which means 'one or a group of holy fighter(s).' Insurgents refer to themselves as a mujahideen, when really they are just a bunch of fucking terrorists.
