wacker
This is not the Australian slang version of the English 'wanker'. Wanker literally means 'masturbator' but all the same is used as a general insult to state that someone is not liked nor likeable. 'He is a wanker' or 'Don't be a wanker', 'I'm not going to that bar again, they are all wankers in there' ; 'Wacker' is related in meaning to the word 'Wacky' and also 'wacked' - and means a bit crazy, a fool, an idiot. Although it is not a favourable term, it is more descriptive than an insult.
