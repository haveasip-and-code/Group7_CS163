Dut
An exclamation meaning 'Oh, that fucking sucks!' Originally derived from 'that suuuuuuuucks' - a term used at Edina High School in 2002. But later it morphed into the elusive dut. Often, the dut is complete with a hand motion that includes pointing one arm outward while hitting the inner elbow of said arm with the other hand. A dut can be used on yourself (self-dut), others (dut), or a large group of people (duts all around).
