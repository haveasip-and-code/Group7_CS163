Toonzone
The largest database of animation past and present on the 'Net on paper, but is really a biased website dedicated to ramming the asses of W.B's D.C animated cartoons, Disney, and anime, they don't pay any attention to the flagship shows such as Transformers and Thundercats that set the standard for what came afterwards. ; The deluded twats are also under the assumption they can write and draw good looking 'virtual comics' when they suck balls at it.
