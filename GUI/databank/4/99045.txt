Red Cap
Red Cap, a distinctly Canadian beer, is sold in a stubby bottle and has been compared to mule piss as well as the discarge from an elephant's anus. ; This product, if offered to good friends who help you move, should not be consumed and the purveyors of the Red Cap should be ridiculed for months thereafter. Also, any situation which has a negative outcome or shamelessly cheap origins can be referred to as a 'Red Cap' situation. ; Red Cap can be used as a verb, interchangable with 'Pwned.'
