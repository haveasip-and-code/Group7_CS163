upanatem
A foreshortening of 'up and at them'. An english colliquial (possibly London-based) phrase. Origins probaly extracted from comic or cartoon strip: 'Up an at them Atom Ant' (1960's). Now used to rally lovers and friends to face the day and the 'enemy' of repetitive city life, corporate slavery, hang-over mornings, and intended to strike optimism and place energy and intent (with emphasism) into one's colleague.
