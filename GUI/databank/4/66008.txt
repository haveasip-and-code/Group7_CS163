icp
ICP is one of the greatest bands in the world. Most people think that Violent J and Shaggy are satanists, racists, homophobic, ect. But ICP has nothing to do with that. They are not satanists even though they might act like they are. They believe in god and want to go to Shangri La or Heaven. They are not racist or homophobic. They rap about all of the juggalos and runnin with lunatics. I am a juggalette and i listen to ICP, Twiztid, ABK, ect. But i also listen to Usher, 50 Cent, Chingy, ect. So you dont only hae to listen to ICP to be a juggalo either.
