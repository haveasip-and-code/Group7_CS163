hootch
A variation of the term, 'hootchie', meaning a female that dresses or acts like a [ho]. If you are questioning weather or not your [homegirl] is a hootch, ask yourself these simple questions: ; 1) Every time this [beeyotch] comes around your [crib] or near your husband, is she wearing low cut shirts so her [tig ol bitties] are bouncin everywhere and/or jeans so tight she straight has a [camel toe]? ; 2) Is this [bitch] always surrounded by a group of [niggas], even though she is married? ; If you said 'yes' to either of these questions, you might want to reconsider who you [kick it] with, and never let that [stank] ass [gutta butt] [triflin] [whore] around your husband/fiancee/boyfriend anymore.
