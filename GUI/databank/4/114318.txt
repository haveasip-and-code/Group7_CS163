jer'k
A person who takes great joy in being a royal pain in your ass for a reason of any sort. ; More at: hilarious, schadenfreude ; Notes: ; Capitalize and add exclamation point (multiple accepted) for emphasis. ; The apostrophe should be mandatory but will be optional and used for special scenarios when the magnitude is too great for a simple capitalization. ; Qualifying phrases ('You're such a...' or 'You big...') are absolutely unnecessary for this one-word retort. Spacing is also key. Jer'k ALWAYS needs its own line. It's a loner.
