lip balm
When someone says something to another person (or group of persons) that, for one reason or another, does not illicit a response. (This phrase was created amongst a group of friends attending Lewis College, Illinois, in the early 1970's, when one of them picked up a tube of ointment labeled LIP BALM, and said to the group, 'Whose lip balm is this?' When no one acknowledged that he had even spoken, the person repeated the phrase, 'Lip balm... lip balm...')
