Entertainment Tonight
An entertainment show with no morals in regards to who they report about. They treat others' misery as if people want to know about it ('What is Martha Stewart doing now in jail? We've got the EXCLUSIVE details!!'). A sad show that needs to be taken off the air, and is a prime example of the stoicism in media today.
