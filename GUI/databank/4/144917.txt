Santa Monica
Small city of roughly 100,000 people that borders Los Angeles on the western side. People seem to think that Santa Monica is this bohemian paradise of a town, but, in fact, it's loaded with yuppies who take all the fun out of it. Many commonly traversed areas smell of urine, and there are homeless people everywhere. Parking is atrocious, the place is crowded as hell, and there isn't much to do except spend money, and go to the beach. Santa Monica is very overrated.
