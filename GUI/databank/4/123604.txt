zl-1
ZL-1 was an option code on the Chevy Corvette and Camaro in 1969. It was a Regular-Production Order (RPO) for the 'Vette, but for the Camaro it was a Central Office Production order (COPO). ; It consisted of an L88 427c.i. engine but replaced the normal cast-iron block with an aluminum one, and saved 100lbs. in the process. This lead to 50/50 weight distrubtion for both models. To make up for the fact that aluminum is weaker than iron, the block was beefed up substantially. A dry-sump oil system was used, and the stock camshaft was replaced with a longer duration one. The ZL-1 weighed just over 500lbs. total and could produce 585hp @ 7000rpm at the crank. Fuel shutoff occured at 7100rpm. Torque output was officially rated at 460ft-lbs, but it is/was actually over 500ft-lbs. ; A complete ZL-1 'Vette, of which only 2 were produced, had a dry weight of just under 3,000lbs. In addition to the 2 Corvettes produced with the ZL-1, 69 Camaro's also recieved the engine. All ZL-1-equipped cars featured the M22 'Rock-Crusher' close-ratio 4-speed transmission, although one ZL-1 test car had a 'beefed-up' 3-speed automatic. ; A grand total of 500 ZL-1 engines were produced in order to homologate it for racing.
