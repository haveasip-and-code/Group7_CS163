internets
A term used by George W. Bush when he actually had meant to say 'Internet': ; While it's true that there exists an Internet2, there is no plausible reason to believe that Bush was referring to it, because I have no reason to believe that he is sufficiently technologically literate to be aware of its accidents and (more importantly), Internet2 is used solely as a network with which academic institutions transfer files at extremely high speeds and would therefore not have information about Bush's alleged millitary service foul play.
