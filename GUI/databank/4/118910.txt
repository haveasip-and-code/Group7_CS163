Inner Thug
An adaptation of John Bradshaws theory of 'Inner Child'. Basically it means everyone has an Inner Thug that wants to get out. It sometimes expresses itself through a fascination with Hip Hop and Grand Theft Auto. Simply another term to describe the uncivilized part of our natures and the desire to be lawless.
