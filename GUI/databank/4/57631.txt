Dragon
An actual reptile that existed in the creataceous period as the largest reptile of all. It evolved to swim in water and thus they didn't get entirely wiped out in the mass extinction by the meteor. Most of the remaining fish-like dragons moved to rivers and lakes in china. They moved ontowards land Thus giving the Ancient chinese' their long scaly like dragon symbol.). They were now long scaly dragons, with small useless fins. Evolution gave them back their wings and in medieval times, they flew around and actually did breath fire. (They had hydrogen chambers near the lungs and they ate a substance from mountainsides that causes a reaction to cause fire when mixed with the hydrogen.). Dragons died out near the end of the medieval time due to local kings getting angry at them for killing local livestock and whatnot. 2 dragon remains were found in the Carpathean mountains along with burnt dead and decayed warrior bodies. If you think i'm wrong, think about it. How did so many old civilizations have a dragon symbol? Was it just a coincidence? No. Did they ALL form their own mythological creature that was almost exactly alike in every civilization? Old artic people had a dragon symbol, and so did chinese people. They had no relationship or methods of contact. Coincidence? Very unlikely. My source Dragons : A fantasy made real, aired on Animal Planet in apri (I think).
