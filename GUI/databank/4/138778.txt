beer spears
A drinking game originating in Gloucester Ontario. The premise is to tape a can of beer to one's hand and consume. Then tape another atop it and consume that one. This continues until a huge spear like weapon is fashioned out of cans and the participants fight eachother. ; Optional: make shields out of boxes!
