hooptie
Any car that the owner has spent more money on trying to spice it up than it is worth. If you come to Fresno, California, you will see an '83 Corolla with $2,000 rims or...or...HAHAHA! You will see a '94 Geo Metro with a $4,000 paint job and $3,000 rims I recently procured in a race because he thought it was fast.
