Totally Rad to the Max
1. The coolest anything can be. This short, simple phrase perfectly conveys the Platonic ideal of Awesomeness. No matter how many other positive adjectives are strung together to describe something, they cannot amount to more than this. ; 2. The highest appellation bestowed by The King of Rad. Very few have received this honor throughout the ages, though many have tried. It is usually given without prior knowledge or expectation of the recipient, as the truly cool know what they are and really don't care all that much about other people's opinions.
