jihad
A word that apparently used to mean something peaceful in Arabic according to the erudite advocates of the peaceful version of Islam. The correlation between exploding buildings and the word jihad today suggests that it has become something different. Much like a holy war. Or a path towards tranquility... in the form of jihadis (not to be confused with jedis) treading over the dead bodies of those who never wished evil upon them. Most importantly, it's a word we should use playfully to piss off the political correctness pundits and the assholes who believe it will benefit them in the afterlife to kill innocent people.
