mushmom
1. (verb) To charge recklessly towards almost certain defeat. Very rarely does one 'mushmom' and win. ; also ; 2. (noun) Monster in the game [Maple Story]. ; Comes from the online game [Maple Story]. During a week in August of 2005, some events were unleashed where monsters attacked the town within the game. During one particular part of the event, a bunch of [n00b]s were wandering around a town when a monster called Mushmom attack. (Sidenote: Mushmom is one of the stronger monsters in the game that only very elite people can kill.) The [n00b]s, believing they had [skillz], decided to bond together for one moment and attack Mushmom all at once. Someone shouted 'CHARGE HER!' and all the [n00b]s rushed forward...and died moments later, not even harming the giant mushroom in the process.
