gamers
An all-inclusive term to describe the maligned, often-misunderstood group of people that regularly engage in video, computer, or tabletop games. ; Though the percentage of people who participate in such activities has increased in recent years, a certain stigma still surrounds those elite few who can call themselves 'true gamers'. These are the people you see getting together for a rousing session of Dungeons & Dragons once a week, or who you will regularly see planted in front of a TV or computer monitor, immersed in the bliss of gamedom. ; This is not to say gamers are the bespectacled hermits that the stereotype has long been. We are everywhere, in many shapes and forms. We live and breathe the likes of Halo, Warcraft, Unreal Tournament, Mage: The Ascension, and more. And the gamer is here to stay.
