on my way to church
1. To be on the path to righteousness, usually you are comming from an unrighteous path. ; 2. When a gangsta who aint made amends for all the shit that he has done, but intends to before he dies..... ; 3. Title of Jim Jones' Album released in 2004. Supossedly he claims that when he was a child, one day he ran away from home on a sunday, and since then never went to church.
