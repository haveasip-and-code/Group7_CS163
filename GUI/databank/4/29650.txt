Rock
Just about the most general term for music there ever will be. ; In terms of music, it is used by kids who are talking to kids with no taste in music/parents, and will not know of any of the bands you're talking about, for example: ; Lamer Or Parent: What kind of music do you listen to? ; Cool Kid: *sigh*...rock. We'll leave it at that. ; Also used in the popular game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors', the game that can be used to decide anything, at anytime. (Rock beats scissors, just so you know.) ; Also used as a supstitute for 'cool' sometimes, but not really.
