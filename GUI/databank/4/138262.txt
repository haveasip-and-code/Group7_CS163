Y-Aye-man
Correct spelling would be Yi-Ei-Man ; The term is directly related to the terms [Aye] and [Aye Aye] ; It was a phrase that the people of the north of the Britians, developed as a sort of war cry when Vikings were attacking their coastlines. ; The Britians used to yell the words 'Yi-Ei-Man' to the attacking Vikings, which mean literally 'No, Always, Man' ; The phrase was intending to imply that the Britains would never join the Vikings crews and would fight to the death down to the last man. ; In modern times the words have completely lost all meaning and the phrase is just a sort of slang way of agreeing to something - ironically exactly the opposite of what it should be.
