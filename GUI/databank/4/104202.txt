Brazil
The largest country of South America and one of the most beautiful of the world. Also known in the world for its peaceful and kind people. The famous Rain Forest is placed in the north of the country, and is rich in mineral water, minerals (gold, quartz, bauxite, etc...) and the most important: bio-diversity. For this reason it needs to be protected and not explored by foreign people with the excuse to protect the nature.
