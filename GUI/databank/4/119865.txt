The Gilbert School
Located in Winsted, CT, The Gilbert School was founded by William L. Gilbert. Was at one point a private school, as Mr. Gilbert left a will that contained a clause stating that people who attended St. Joseph's School would not be accepted to his high school. This prompted the local church to rename the school to St. Anthony's School (aka, St. Tony's Prison). ; While the Gilbert website says that they provide 'outstanding educational opportunities' for students, the alumni of the school would beg to differ. Gilbert has become a very poorly managed school, with a focus leaning more towards sports than education. Students are rarely encouraged to work to their fullest potential, and some of the faculty could care less of them.
