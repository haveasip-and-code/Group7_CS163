big pokey
A H-Town rapper and a giant of a man. Big Po' has been featured on tracks with rappers such as Paul Wall, Lil Keke, Mike Jones, etc. His lyrics are gangsta and reflect the laid back style we've come to know from Texas. When Big Pokey spits lyrics, his voice sounds Deep, Fat, and Out of Breath. He brings a real sense of the streets to any song he's on.
