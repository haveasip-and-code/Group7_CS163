Trump Tower
One of [Donald Trump]'s buildings in [New York City]. It is filled with luxurious appartments in the middle/upper floors, and a Starbucks Coffee in the lobby (which is open to the public). The Apprentice, Trump's hit TV show, is also filmed here, on one of the higher floors. I think there might be offices in it too...
