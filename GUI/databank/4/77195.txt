beer thirty
a hypothetical time of day uttered in response to the question of 'what time is it.' when consumption of said malted beverage becomes an event that is either inevitable or required to proceed with life as we know it in modern society. No other time expression exists with beer in it, ie. there is no beer fifteen, or quarter to beer, there is also not a half past a beer or beer forty five. If it is not exactly beer thirty when someone asks you just say its getting close to beer thirty.
