Robin Quivers
A founding member and Newswoman of [The Howard Stern Show], Quivers is often recognized as the force that keeps the show from completely derailing. ; While being the target of the more feeble-minded members of the audience, Quivers provides a unique perspective to the male-dominated topics and guests of the show. She has become a more open and valuable part of the on-air team since the departures of [Jackie Martling] and [Stuttering John]. She is currently developing a Povich-esque talk show with Sony Entertainment.
