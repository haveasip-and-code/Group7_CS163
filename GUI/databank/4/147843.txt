shitpit
A reoccurring red and blotchy rash surrounding the armpit. The cause and the cure for this symptom are both unknown. Some experts believe that it is due to continual usage of a certain arm deodorant and/or antiperspirant in which the person is somewhat allergic. A sufferer of 'shitpit' usually decides not to switch the infecting product just for the heck of it, rather than logically trying a different product. It is a very complex disease affecting the person both mentally (insanity) and physically (red pits).
