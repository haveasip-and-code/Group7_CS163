Ministry
Highly influential Industrial Metal act, with the core members being Al Jourgenson and Paul Barker. During the early 80's, it was just Al, and he was ripping off bands like [Depeche Mode]. Around 1986, though, he decided to go for a darker synth style. Then Barker joined and the rest as they say is history. Very active during the '80s and early '90s, but then they took a break. Recently Barker has left the band, but Jourgenson backed by a new band, is making music more frequently again. Their lyrics often attack politicians and religious fanatics.
