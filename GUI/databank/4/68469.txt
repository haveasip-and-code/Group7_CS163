General Lee
The car form the 'Duke's of Hazard' TV show. It's a 1969, Dodger charger with altered engine, the number 01 on painted on the sides and the doors welded shut like a typical racing car. It was named after general Robert E. Lee, commanding general of the main Confederate Army during the Civil War. His army was based out of Virgina due to it'd large population. This would account for the car's Rebel Flag paint job and it's horn that played the first few notes of 'Dixie'. The car's main purpose was to drive really fast and do a lot of sweet jumps while the duke boys hooted and hallered.
