mandies
Shorthand term for [Mandrax] (pronounced 'Mandrakes'), a line of highly addictive British pharmaceutical tablets no longer in legal production. They act as [barbiturates] (or '[downers]') and were prescribed as sleeping aids in the late 60s and early 70s. They are prevalent on the drug market in many African countries, as well as a few south Asian countries. As Mandrax was initially produced in pill form and meant to be taken orally, many abusers ground up the pills and smoke them with [Dagga], because like most other illicit substances, the effects are greatly enhanced when snorted, smoked, consumed in conjunction with alcohol or injected into the bloodstream. Short-term side effects are not much worse than your average anti-depressant (cramps, headaches, emotional problems, etc.) but loss of muscle control (resulting in the user suddenly collapsing) and toxin-induced psychosis have also been found to result from Mandrax use.
