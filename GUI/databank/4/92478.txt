drunk pants
The pants you got really drunk in. Often times, you will wake up wearing them. Other times, you may find them on the floor or someplace random. Inside the pockets you may or may not find your keys, your wallet, your cell phone, wadded up dollar bills, and pieces of paper with other people's phone numbers.
