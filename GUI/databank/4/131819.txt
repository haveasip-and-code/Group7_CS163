Mumma Duck
A.K.A Mother Duck ; A really good friend who looks after you when you are too drunk to walk. They are the person that wipes the smeared make-up from your eyes, the vomit from your chin, finds you any form of water, carries you halfway across town, tells your parents that someone spiked your drink, feeds you bread to soak 'it' up, gives you their jacket even though its 10 degrees and you are wearing 4 jumpers already and tucks you in. The defining factor between a Mumma Duck and an awesome Mumma Duck is whether they do it all laughing or not.
