African-American
A rather inaccurate term, used to describe a black American. On paper, it seems fairly sensible as [British]- [Asian] would be used as an ethnic description of Olympic boxer Amir Khan, as he is British but has parents from Asia (Pakistan). ; However, I don't need to tell anyone with half a brain there have been black people in the USA for hundreds of years who have about as much connection to Africa as I do to Bill Clinton just because I'm white. ; Think: could you see 50 Cent playing Senegalese folk music, phoning a witch doctor or conducting a 'rain dance' with his (mostly black, I presume) G-Unit rapper mates? Nah!! ; No, so shut the hell up, Mr Politically Correct - you're playing into the racists' hands by using this definition! (See [go back to Africa].) ; Another result of the [political correctness], which seems to have made about as useful a contribution to Western society as [AIDS.] ; D'oh!!
