redick
An overrated basektball player from Duke who shot 4-14 in their loss to Michigan State in the 2005 NCAA tourney. Last year, in Duke's tourney loss to U Conn (where he choked on the last shot), he shot 4-12. The year before, in Duke's tournament loss to Kansas, he shot 2-16. So in easily the three biggest games of J.J. Redick's career, he's shot 10-42 from the field. 23.8% ; Clearly, he's the best shooter in the country.
