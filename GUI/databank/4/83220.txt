black metal
black metal fans wear hilarious 'corpse paint' inspired by the panda bear. also the will be clad in black (and only black) leather with studs, spikes and nails averywhere and black bandshirts with illegible band logos. ; the will not laugh or smile, but rather one must be 'grim', 'necro' and 'frostbitten'. the greet each other with 'Hail!' or, on special occasions, 'Infernal Hails!'. ; in their possession will be a large collection of poor quality bootlegs of bands with names like Azhubham Haani that have never produced anything but bootlegs. bands like these are 'true' and good, because nobody knows them.rare stuff is always good. bands that have sold-out and therefore must be hated are e.i. Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir. True black metal is Norwegian. ; fans of black metal tend to have no sense of humour or selfirony and are certainly NOT tolerant. they will give any entry that gives a negative or humorous view of black metal and its listeners a 'thumb down'.
