fox
(v) The act by which an independently created expansion on an intellectual property is shut down, or removed by the company that owns that property. Comes from the infamous habit 20th Century Fox makes of shutting down independently developed game modifications based on their IPs ([Alien], [Predator], [Die Hard]), though certainly Fox is not the only corporation that does this.
