anarchy
Anarchy is impossible, however much young teenagers running around wearing anarchy beanies and bondage pants want to disagree. Anarchy is the absence of any form of political authority; disorder and confusion; the absence of any principle or common standard or purpose. However, by rising against authority as a whole to overthrow government which would create anarchy, you are working together as a group for a common goal, which would totally contradict the whole concept. so fuck you.
