St. Mary's
St. Mary's is a private, Catholic high school located in the middle of [Stockton], CA. The tuition is extremely high for the small facilities they offer. ; (note: the following descriptions are accurate of most of the school's population.) ; The parents are either filthy rich and purchase name-brand clothes and expensive cars for their brats or are dirt poor and receive more financial aid than you make in a year. The girls are either snobby, cliquish, and fake or are lonely, shy, and goodie-two-shoes. The boys are just that: boys. They are immature, horny, and bastards. The teachers are well-intentioned, and most of them are cool if you like to have shit all over your face. A brown-noser, dumbass. And please feel free to partake in lots of alcohol and assorted drugs from the students' parties, usually held out in the boonies. If you enjoy being plastic or enjoy being gothic or enjoy being picked on, tell your parents to pay those ungodly tuition payments so you can get yours! Even from those whorish girls!
