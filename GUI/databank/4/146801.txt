Picasso
Picasso; noun. A girl who is a mess. Think of Picasso's work, and you're there. She has all the parts but they may be mis-shapen, unsightly, or even in the wrong place. This is not just limited to girls with faces like bulldogs chewing wasps, but it will give you a good idea of the starting point. ; See also [Monet] and [Van Gogh]
