Timehole
A timehole is any place that time seems to pass by at a dramatically increased speed. Some say that the increase in speed is directly proportional to the deadlines one has. ; The first timehole was discovered by a young girl in Surrey England named Alice who died of lupus after coming out of the timehole. Timeholes have known to become mobile encapsulting around the office dullard.
