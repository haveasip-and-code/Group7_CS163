fsckit
It is not just a site. It is not just a fad. It is not just a one-night-stand. It is and will continue to be a lifestyle for us all. As the ages come of college and getting closer to the 'real world,' fsckit will be a way to keep that common ground for which we all yearn deep deep down. If you've never heard of it and don't plan on trying it...just remember: Syntac owns your soul.
