TTSP
Short for The The Strokes Party. The political party thought up By Justin (aka Julian), Woody (aka Albert), Jed (aka Fab), Lachy (aka Nick), Mrs Z (aka Nickolai). Will be joining Australian Parliament in the near future, but there will be no real legislation other than to listen to The Strokes.
