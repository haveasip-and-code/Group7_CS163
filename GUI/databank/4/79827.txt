kaizers orchestra
Kaizers Orchestra is a Norwegian band that uses the most unusual and creative ways of creating amazingly original music. Their lyrics deal with different issues then love, like most artists. Instead, Kaizers sing about Heaven, Hell, Russian Roulette, and they tell strange stories of quirky characters and their adventures. They are a great band, one of the best ever, despite being different.
