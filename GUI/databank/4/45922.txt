Pro-Lifer
Very often, a pro-lifer is a bible beater without a grasp on anything except their futile task of trying scientifically prove a book without risking disproving it. These people can sometimes be seen parading around with the pictures of those who bomb abortion clinics and shoot abortion doctors. It's a good thing they're not Islamic terrorists parading pictures of THEIR 'martyrs' around, right? Riiiiiiight.
