Ron Artest
A great defensive player who is well know to lose his cool. In my opinion he is the craziest player to grace the NBA since Dennis Rodman. Well known for the November 19th incident in Detroit, were he jumped into the stands and attacked the wrong fan who he thought threw the beer on him after his semi-altercation with Ben Wallace.
