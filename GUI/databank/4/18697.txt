frunker
a frunker is one who acts like a person who is drunk, but is obviously faking it. This person can most often times be heard saying stuff like: 'dude, i'm soo wasted right now, i'm so drunk man!' or 'WHOA, this booze [effed] me up good.' The person might also use their frunkiness as a way to hit on girls who are actually drunk.
