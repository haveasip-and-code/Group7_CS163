Jacksonville Florida. A beautiful little city nestled on the east coast against the Atlantic Ocean. With its close proximity to Georgia one might associate it with its neighbor 90 miles north, but one visit to Jacksonville will immediately change your mind. The glory of Florida summers and the mild winters of southern Georgia packaged into one makes for one breathtaking city. ; I recommend visiting Atlantic Beach, just fifteen minutes east of the heart of Jacksonville. Atlantic Beach, a small seashore community with bleached white sand and great surf, ranging from placid lake to Great Rapids torrent. Take your pick.
