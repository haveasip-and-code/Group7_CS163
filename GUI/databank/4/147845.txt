spaghetti code
A coding style often executed by [fucktard]s unaware of or to lazy to use proper structural coding styles. The term refers to how the code becomes a hard to untangle mass, mutch like spaghetti. The intent of code is clearer if functions, breaking, classes and loops are used, also you don't have to go through loads of lines searching about and there is a nice tree structure and bunnys start jumping about and doing a happy dance. There is no excuse, therefore, for coding such a messy way, because if people continue to do this there will be lots of people on fire(and not in a good way, see [sexy lesbian orgy on fire]).
