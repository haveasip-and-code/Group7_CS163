Parents Television Council
Media Watchdog group which claims to be non-partisan composed of bored housewives who drink their daily glass of wine a day who believe that they themselves should not parent their children, but in fact, the major networks should. L. Brent Bozell III, the founder, also heads up a similarly non-partisan organization which watches the news networks looking to prove a liberal bias trying to destroy this country, and is against all gay rights.
