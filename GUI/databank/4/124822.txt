brazilian
As otherwise noted, Brazilian can refer to either a person from the country of Brazil or a type of female hair-removal waxing. However, Brazilian can also be used as an exaggerated and made up figure. ; When something costs a lot of money or there's a lot of something, instead of using a random large number like a million or a billion or a zillion, so as to exaggerate the cost or amount of the item(s), one can say Brazilian to garner a chuckle or 2.
