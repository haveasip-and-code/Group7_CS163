Dunkadelic Generation
Is the era of kids born between 1975 and 1985. This era was influenced by the emergence of Dr.J and the Hip-Hop culture. They have grown up entirely on Hip-Hop. Michael Jordan and RUN-DMC continued the influence and helped popularize the shoe apparel industry that has become fashion symbols in the hallways, playgrounds, and neighborhoods of the urban youth.
