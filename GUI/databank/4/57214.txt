Exton  PA
This is the place for you if you want to find roads with traffic light after traffic light after traffic light after traffic light AFTER TRAFFIC LIGHT AFTER OH MY GOD HOW MANY TRAFFIC LIGHTS CAN YOU PUT IN ONE QUARTER MILE STRETCH OF ROAD? I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE EXTON MALL SO I CAN WALK AROUND WITH THE GOTH KIDS WHILE NOT EVER BUYING ANYTHING AND GETTING YELLED AT BY MALL COPS FOR SITTING ON THE COUCHES IN THE HALLWAY, AND I HAVE TO STOP EVERY 25 FEET TO GET FROM BUSINESS 30 TO ROUTE 30! But at least the road to the Regal Theater isn't BACKED UP ALL THE WAY FROM THE LIGHT BACK TO THE INTERSECTION OF 30 AND WHITFORD ROAD! AND WHY ARE THEY PUTTING IN A LOWES HERE!?!?!?! ARE THEY PUTTING IN ANOTHER TRAFFIC LIGHT!? THEY ARE!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHGHGHHGGG!!
