white russian
The newest and most powerful bud on the market, it's a cross between AK-47 and White Widows, hence the name. Truly an ungodly plant, you're usually blazed off your ass halfway through your first hit. ; There is honestly nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, out there more powerful than the Russian, as proven by it's current dominance in the Cannibus Cup. Generally sells for double standard dro prices, or close to it. Very, VERY, worth the price.
