1.) the Place where they film THE OC, which is in LA county. Considered to be the wealthiest and most affluent neighborhood in all of Los Angeles county. ; However..It is in reality a shit hole. What use is living on the coast line if you can't go to the beach? Its a nice little bubble..but once you leave you are in the fucking ghetto, i.e. carson, compton, torrance, etc.. ; A place that wishes it was located in southern Orange County California, but its not. The only reason why people live in PV as opposed to Laguna Beach, Newport Beach, Newport Coast, Corona Del Mar, Dana Point, San Clemente, etc.. ; is because its the only halfway decent place to live in LA
