DaleSpring
This term refers to the suburb Springdale in Cincinnati, Ohio. This area is home for a popular mall, big movie theater and many restaurants. This is the former home of many elderly white people to now a younger generation of blacks and hispanics. Some of the most poppin' places around is Perkins and the BP gas station right across the street from it, the rec (which is located in the ghetto of DaleSpring) where many 'substances' are transported and all the many local parks in the area where booty calls and other sexual acts occur. This is NOT your average neighborhood and it's becoming more 'hood' everyday. So, don't ever be afraid to holla at somebody in da DaleSpring, they won't hurt you, but they may ask you for something...
