Mexican Screwdriver
It wasn't until vodka swept through mid-twentieth-century America that the Screwdriver - along with other tempting libations (Moscow Mule and Martini to name a couple), began to gain recognition with bartenders as the modern contemporary of highball. Suffice to say a premium vodka (Absolut, Stoli, Smirnoff) or tequila (Arandas, Reserva de la Familia, Jose Cuervo) will often be considered essential for this drink. Pour 2 ounces of this (over a few ice cubes) into a highball glass, and fill the glass with 4 - 6 ounces Tampico, Citrina, hell even tang or the classic freshly squeezed orange juice. Add an orange wheel or a dash of angostura bitters to your highball for a lick of (optional) garnish. Enjoi bitches!
