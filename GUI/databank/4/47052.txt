refugium
When a great dane throws saxaphones into my neighbor's toilet which summons a magical octopus capable of firing raspberries out of its eyes which, as an end result solves world hunger and unleashes a flurry of robots that fold up into balls and roll around the Great Wall of China. Thank God for the power rangers and for Turkey. (IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM, JOIN 'EM!)
