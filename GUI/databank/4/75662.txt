Adult Alternative
Form of soft rock that has more structure to it and is more catchy than regular soft rock. Usually has a much more 'mature' sound than normal rock. Bands are usually played more on VH1 than MTV. ; The musicians in these bands usually are in their 30s, dress quite modestly, and are generally some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. They just seem like people you'd run into at a grocery store.
