Brigid
A celtic name meaning SHINING BRIGHT ; Sometimes spelt Bridget, Brigit, Brighit, or Brighid ; HISTORY OF THE NAME SAINT ; Saint Brigid was an Irish saint who is known for her generosity to the poor. St. Brigid is sometimes known as Bridey, Mary of Gaels and even as Biddy. St. Brigid was born near Dundalk to a pagan Gaelic chieftain named Dubtach (Duffy) and to a Christian slave mother named Brocessa, who was sold soon after Brigid's birth. She was baptized by St. Patrick with whom she became friends. She never forgot her mother and despite being forbidden to do so, she left her home, located her mom, negotiated her release and returned to her fathers house. To her dismay her father had arranged her marriage to a poet. Brigid had already vowed to remain [celibate] and to do God's work so once more, she left her home, this time forever. In 468 she and 7 other women she formed the 1st female monastic community in Ireland. They helped the poor and were attributed with many miracles. Despite having limited resources they never seemed to be without food or supplies for their good works. Where the modern town of Kildare now stands she founded a school of Art and a Monastery at Cill Dara. The most famous miracle associated with Brigid tells of her confrontation with an Irish chieftain. She asked him for some land so that she could build a monastic community. He replied that she could have whatever amount of land her cloak could cover. She took the cloak from her shoulders and cast it on the ground where it covered over 12 acres of the land which he willingly gave. The date of her death is February 1st, her feastday, which is still celebrated with the traditional creation of the St Brigid Cross, made from reeds. She is buried next to St Patrick in Downpatrick.
