Munted
The point after a massive night of raping your head with narcotics where you're brain no longer connects with the rest of your body - symptoms are involuntary drooling, twitching, grinding what stubs are left of your teeth, chewing your face off, hallucinating and generally making a c**t of yourself. Usually followed by a stint in the twilight zone - a dirty, frightening place between sleep and awareness. Closely associated with [fiended]
