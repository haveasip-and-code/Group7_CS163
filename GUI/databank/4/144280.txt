Very high-quality cocaine, usually right off the key and uncut. Doesn't look like regular coke---it's flaky instead of grainy, it's sparkly instead of dull, and it's slightly yellow-grey instead of being plain white. Good shit, since 1 gram = ~12 lines. Numbs all the way down and gives you a case of the chills.
