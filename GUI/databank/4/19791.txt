Singapore
One of the best cities/countries to visit, if not live, in Asia. It's a shame that not as many people do so compared to others in the continent, namely Hong Kong and Tokyo, and other major cities around the world. Very orderly society, to a fault at times. And EVERYTHING works, particularly the infrastructure.
