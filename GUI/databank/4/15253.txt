Nintendo 64
One of the best consoles I've ever owned. While it is true that there were a lack of good Third Party titles, the fact is that I never buy a Nintendo console for Third Party games. ; Nintendo made their fans proud with this console. Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask were WONDERFUL, Goldeneye 007 and Perfect Dark were stunningly good, and Super Mario 64 just wouldn't stop for me. These few Nintendo games managed to last me until the PS2 and GameCube come out! ; Let people say what they want, I love this console!
