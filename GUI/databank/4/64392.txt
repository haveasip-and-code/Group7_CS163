taste of chaos
A mini and winter/spring version of the [warped tour] exept it's indoors. 2005 kicked off the first year of the tour with The Used, My Chemical Romance, Killswitch Engage, Senses Fail, A Static Lullaby, Underoath and many more. It includes acoustic stages as well. Very amazing concert.
