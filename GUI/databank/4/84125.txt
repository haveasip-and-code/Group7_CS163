closetsnog
Noun ; A friend (usually one of the opposite sex) who is always hanging out with you that they might as well just be living in the closet in your room. This is not to be used towards an annoying friend who you don't like spending time with but is there anyway. In stead it is used to describe a cute, loveable friend who is always there for you when you need them, willing to shower you with affection and of course the occasional [snog].
