American Idiot
An album by my favourite band green day. Released in 2004. ; It is a 'rock opera' and tells the story of some young kids in modern america, and says a big fuck you to politians. some [fucktards] believe this album made green day sellouts, but they are just trying to be cool and thinking they are the true fans because they have nimrod and dookie! well fuck you so do i! And if you arsewipes actually sat your fat asses down and listened to it you would realise it is good, maybe not as good as dookie, but still good. Green day are NOT SELLOUTS. Its not their fault people liked american idiot. They didn't know people would, they have always said they write for themselves not others. And yes, some people have only got american idiot, and you find it extremely funny to call them teenyboppers and shit, but its not their fault they were only like two went dookie was realised, and how were they to known [MTV] was shit before they actaully watched it. Nothing is going to change by you telling the world you don't like it! And just admit it Billie Joe is hot!
