hoodrich
Someone who buys expensive clothes, cars, and eats out at expensive resteraunts, but returns home to a shack in the [hood]. They usually are in debt up to their ears, and they keep trying to live the affluent lifestyle untill the repo man comes and tows their car. ; Most of the people who live the hoodrich lifestyle are black, and the hoodrich car of choice is a Caddilac Escalade with 30 inch chrome rims. All bought with money they don't have. They would rather eat ramen or government cheese and live in a roach motel than have to not have expensive stuff.
