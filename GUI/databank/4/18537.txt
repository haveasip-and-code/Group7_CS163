Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Aqua Teen Hunger Force (ATHF) is HILLARIOUS! If you haven't seen it yet, make a note to watch it. It is genius. I mean, a walking talking human sized milkshake, thats awesome! Also a floating box of fries and an uncooked wad of meat? Its great, one of the greatest things to happen to TV. I think carl is the funniest character on there.
