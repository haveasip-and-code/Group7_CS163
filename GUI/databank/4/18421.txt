Cincinnati
A wonderful city in southwestern Ohio, just across from the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. However, people are slightly odd here. They have extreme obsessions for chili and beanbag toss, which they like to call [cornhole]. Their sports teams are fairly good as well, especially the [Reds].
