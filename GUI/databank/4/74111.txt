Frito Bandito
A Mexican bandit who used to advertise Fritos. White [liberal] twits and [pantywaist] oafs said that the Frito Bandito was racist because it looked like a Mexican, and anybody who saw him would instantly and automatically believe that all Mexicans were bandits, and that they spoke English with a Mexican accent.
