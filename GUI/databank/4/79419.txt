lads
Lads are usually teenagers that fail in school and drop out, spending their lives 'bumming' around the same place 7 days a week. ; They can be spotted by their white caps (usually of polo brand) tilted up showing the front of their hair. Also they wear shorts (also of polo or nautica brand) no matter what season it is, they wear them even when it is snowing, they also wear polo or nautica shirts, with the collar popped up and lastly they wear sports shoes, in most cases nike TN's.
