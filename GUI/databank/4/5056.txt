you're cut
Exclamation used to show disapproval or to emphasize failiure, used after the subject has just said or done something incredibly stupid. ; Derived from the concept of being 'cut' from a team, play, band, class, etc. The implication is that the subject has not demonstrated a satisfactory level of competence. In this way, 'you're cut' is similar to '[you fail at life]' and similar exclamations. ; The group from which the subject is 'cut' is intentionally left open for interpretation. ; (NB: 'You're cut' is often accompanied by the 'scissors' hand gesture.)
