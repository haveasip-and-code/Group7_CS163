blow off
a very lame term for a break up. ; a completely irritating phrase that[immature] losers use when they believe they have found a girl they like, and they girl thinks that they might possibly be [cool], but later realize the guy is an obsessive retard and no longer wants to get to know the guy. the guy in the situation then gets very upset and angry and uses the phrase repeatedly following the rightful disinterest of the girl, and often times pissing her off. *note: used in various tenses: blown off, blew off, blow off
