kiss of death
When smoking marijuana discreetly in a confined environment (i.e. dorm room, office cubicle, etc.) smoke is often exhaled through dryer sheets for decreased smell. Sometimes, when an especially good hit is taken, brown lip-marks can be seen on the dryer sheet. This looks disgusting, and is known as the 'kiss of death'.
