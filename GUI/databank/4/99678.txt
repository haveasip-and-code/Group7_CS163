Benny Patrol
A group of angry Jersey shore natives, fed up with the Southward migration each year of beach going New Yorkers (New Yorkahs) and all those who live north of the Raritan Bridge. The group was founded in the Spring of 2005 by locals from the coastal towns of Brick and Toms River. Their primary goal is the elimination of the Benny threat to their sacred sands and coastal waters.
