ceilidh
pronounced 'kay-lay', its pretty much a scottish folk dancing party where every one joins in in a kind of orchestrated dance and has muchos fun! ; the expresssion 'to get ceilidh'(kayleyed) meaning to get very drunk could possibly come from all the drunken frivolity that takes place in these mad scottish parties of the same name.
