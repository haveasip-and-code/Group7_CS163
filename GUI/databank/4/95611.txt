Music
Any rhythmic expression....The main requirement is an instrumental. Without instruments playing a beat or whatnot, the singer or rapper is not performing music. With that said, the dude saying that music requires singing and not rapping(what he calls 'talkin') is very wrong. Groups such as orchestras perform and release albums. They dont always include a chorus with them. Now I know for a fact you wont deny that orchestras play music. Your embedded ethnocentrism wont allow you to. Most orchestras consist of caucasian musicians; who do not sing. It is still music; and very good music at that. Therefore, hip-hop artists who grant it, for the most part, do not sing, still are considered musical performers due to the fact that their music displays rhythmic expressions. Lastly, hip-hop musicians are far more talented than you think when it comes to the complexity of their music and their lyrics specifically. Not always the case for rock an roll. However, I am not disrespecting the genre of rock and roll either. It is simply my stating that most people overlook the talent of hip-hop artists. ; Them gothic chicks need to get themselves educations before they obtain the right to judge music that they have little to no knowledge about.
