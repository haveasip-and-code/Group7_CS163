lekker
Dutch and Afrikaans (South African) for 'tasty', but used incessantly by the [cloggies] to describe everything that could ever possibly be considered even marginally above mediocre. Despite this not leaving much wriggle room in Holland, they manage to use it all the same, since they don't know any better. Rumour has it that after visiting Belgium (or indeed any other country less flat than Holland), use of this term diminishes remarkably, except when talking /about/ Belgium. I wonder why.
