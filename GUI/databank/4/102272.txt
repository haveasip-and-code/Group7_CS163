Liquid Dancing
Similar to [Raving], Liquid Dance is where the dance manipulates his body to flow as though liquid. Similar to Jello. This happens in clubs, raves and dances, along side breakdancing B-Boys and Ravers. Glowsticks are normally added into this process aswell. ; <Disclaimer> If you are a mediocre dancer, leave this one to the professionals, as it makes you look stupid if not preformed correctly.
