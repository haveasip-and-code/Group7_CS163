tacomatism
Tacomatism(n): 1. the art of fucking things up at the last possible minute, as practiced to perfection by the residents of the city of Tacoma, WA and its outlying regions. 2. an equation which states that one's rate of success varies in direct proportion with one's potential to self-sabotage, and one's proximity to downtown Tacoma. The effect on others is not a variable in this equation, and is not taken into account.
