Pottstown
Or Ptown as the local blacks call it. Located between Philadelphia and Reading it is a huge drug traffiking center. Sitting on the Ho Chi Minh trail of narcotics, Pottstown has became nothing more than a hole of depression and low-income. Many of the more successful residents are moving into the hills to try and escape the crime, depression, and delapidation that is Pottstown. Two high schools, 4 miles apart: one is full of graduates and students persuing higher education ([Pottsgrove]) and the other is the complete opposite which requires a day-care for many single mothers who are still in high school. The local economy is in shambles as the municipality tries desperately to pick up the pieces. The main street, High Street, once bustling is now an alley of garbage, tumbleweeds, and drug-addicted lunatics who walk up and down the street all day and night. Wal-Mart is the town's center for business and many outside businesses are trying to get space in the same shopping center as Wal-Mart to try and make a profit off the already debted Pottstown residents. This place should be avoided at all costs!
