A pseudo-conservative known correctly as a 'neo-con' who likes to pretend they are conservative, but are actually a bunch of pro-corporate whores who worship the grandson of the nazi facilitator Prescott Bush. They are lead by Jim Robinson who, not unlike screaming liberals, will boot you from his site if you say anything wrong about El Presidente Jorge Bushy.
