sweet spot
A spot on the human body that, if pierced, will kill a man within a few seconds, if not instantly. An example would be the abdominal aorta, located to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. Bleed to death in under ten seconds if stabbed there. Another would be at the base of the skull, top of the spinal column.
