Morning Star
While 'Morning Star' can refer to Satan, it's also the name of a type of spiked mace derived from the Medieval period (and vastly used in RPGs and MMORPGs today). A morning star's like a mace, except that maces only have a blunt, crushing head; while morning stars are the variants that have a sharp cluster of metal spikes to add to the smashing power. Many people confuse these to be maces, whereas maces are only ever *blunt*. ; Another common understanding of maces is with regards to the 'ball-and-chain', where a morning star's spiked head (sometimes left blunt) is swung around on a chain or rope. These are actually called 'flails', not maces.
