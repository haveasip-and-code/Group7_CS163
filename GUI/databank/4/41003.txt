wire
An electronic device worn on a person's body that records sounds and transmits the playback to a remote receiver. The wire is usually hidden on someone who is trying to get other people to incriminate themselves in conversation. There are usually cops listening to the receiver close by, and once they hear the incriminating evidence, they can run in and make arrests. ; Sometimes the 'wire' is just a tape recorder (does not transmit).
