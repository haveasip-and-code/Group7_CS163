Zurg
Used in gaming for a attack of many unskilled units on a difficult target. ; From 'The Last Starfighter' a movie from 1984 which had a villian named 'Xur' or 'Zur'. (The villian utilized massed forces which would swamp defenders and the heros could defeat in numbers) The benefit of this strategy is a superior unit or units can only eliminate a certain number of attackers at the same time allowing enough of the attackers to survive, do damage and hopefully defeat the defender or get around it. A classic 'horde' or 'wave' type attack.
