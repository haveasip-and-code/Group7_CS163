Caco
A person who has no self respect, originality, and/or taste for music. Cacos listen to reggaeton at full volume so they seem cool in front of their peers. They also have a tendency to idolatrize cars, women, and money above everything else because they of their obvious superficiality and lack of intelectual capacity. Cacos use plenty of foul language, slang, and will laugh and/or comment on the mention of words like 'stick', 'balls', and 'hole', turning any decent conversation into ridiculous sex talk.
