Fanfiction.net
One of the best website to read fanfiction. It used to be MUCH, MUCH better than it is today, but there was a number of unexplained or stupid decisions. ; Decisions such as reinventing the search system when it was already good. Now you'll be lucky if any search you make with more than one word come up with accurate results. Other decisions include taking away NC-17 rating, banning stories about real life people, and banning stories that doesn't fit a certain format. What's the point of 'unleashing your imagination' if your imagination is restricted? ; Also, there are a number of website problems there. The usual and least believable explanation is something along the lines of 'server upgrade'. ; Despite this, people don't have much choice because FF.Net still has the most stories and the best interface.
