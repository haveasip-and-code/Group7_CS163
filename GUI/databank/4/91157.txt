Haligh
A variation of apple cider, usually sprinkled with grinded Golden Eagle bones for added flavor. Known in most South African cultures as a widely popular dish, especially during 'Kalashkapa', the week long festival of mourning for that bitch of a girlfriend that cheated on you. During this festival, it is customary for mourners to chant 'Haligh haligh haligh' while eating their dish.
