rugby
Hard hitting, fast paced. Great fun. Not, as many have mentioned, an excuse to get in a fight. In fact, fights don't often happen, and when they do, they're over rather quickly. Very little padding (only a scrum cap, and perhaps some shoulder pads---Neither of which make you a pussy. Plenty of pro players use them). A true game for all. No if, and, or buts. Anyone and everyone can play, there's a position to fit each (Just ask our former hooker, who's about 4'10', 90 pounds soaking wet). ; Elegant Violence. ; Brimming with camraderie. You play, kick some ass, and go party afterwards. ; Go All Blacks! New Zealand for the Cup! ; American Football stems from this.
