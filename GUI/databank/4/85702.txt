Solid Aggression
A terrible metal band based in Toronto's heavy metal underground. Using rehashed lyrics, terrible chords and a singer that sounds like a dying gorilla, Solid Aggression manages to pump out terrible music at a surprising pace. ; Liked by pre-pubescant teens and emo kids, Solid Aggression is working its way towards a record deal.
