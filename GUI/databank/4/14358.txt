carriage bolt
(noun, USA/SAE Standard) A [bolt] having a round [head] with a square, ribbed, or fluted [boss] underneath it. The function of the boss being to [bite] into timber to prevent the bolt turning while the [nut] is being tightened. ; This term is often, and wrongly, considered interchangeable with 'coach bolt', which is UK/Australian slang for a [lag bolt]. This may seem a trivial inconsistency to the layman, but is a mixup which has cost innumerable companies lots of money and confused a huge number of people. ; One may perform a quick test to determine whether an item is a [carriage bolt] or [lag bolt]/lag screw: Is it driven (tightened) by its head or can only nuts be driven up it? If the former, it's a carriage bolt, if the latter, it's <i>probably</i> a lag bolt. ; Origin: Old French <i>cariage</i>, from <i>carier</i> &#8216;carry&#8217; bolt (unchanged), Old English. There is no reliable information as to whether the carriage bolt got its descriptor through the manufacture of carriages/coaches or whether 'carriage' refers to the fact that such a bolt is a load-bearing item.
