the rape over
Term recently coined by Mos Def, now used freqently to describe the degeneration of hip-hop from an art form and expressive outlet to glorified criminalistic behavior and corporate domination of a once-underground phenomenon, i.e. De La Soul or KRS-One, who rap about every day events and important issues vs. 50 Cent or Juvenile (By-products of The Rape Over), who rap about murder, theft and what they buy with their millions of dollars (For example, 50 Cent's newest album is titled <i>The Massacre</i>).
