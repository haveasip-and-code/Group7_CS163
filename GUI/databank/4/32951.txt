Gay Marriage
Marriage is NOT a right granted by the state.Marriage is a religious ceremony uniting one man to one woman in 'holy' matrimony.Why do you think they call it 'holy' matrimony? It's religious! ; God commanded to keep marriage sacred and holy and between one man and one woman. ; The state only got their greddy little paws in on it so that they could make money off of selling marriage licenses because they horned in on it as a financial angle by insisting that people must have blood tests and a marriage license so that the state can rip you off and raise revenues for fat asshole politicians to pocket.
