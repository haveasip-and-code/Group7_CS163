gestalt
In Dungeons & Dragons, the term refers to taking a level in two different classes simultaneously when you level up. This is subject to the following guidelines: ; - HD: you get the highest ; - skill points: you get the highest amount between the two classes ; - class skills: all skills that are class skill for either of the two classes are class skills for that level ; - BAB: you take the better progression(*) of the two classes ; - Saves: for each one, you use the better progression(*) of the two classes ; - Special Features: you get all special features(**) of the two classes ; (*) what 'better progression' exactely means when changing classes from the initial two noone knows. a reasonable suggestion is to use fractional BAB and Saves: each level in a class with average BAB adds +3/4 and each level in a class with poor BAB adds +1/2; each level in a class with good Save adds +1/3 and each level in a class with good Save adds +1/2 ; (**) repeated features are taken once. ; Note: Above guidelines are taken from gbnogkfs of the Wizards.COMmunity D&D boards.
