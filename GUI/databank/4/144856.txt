Trench Wars
A server (or 'zone' as they're most commonly referred to) in the online 2d spaceship game 'Continuum'. ; The game SubSpace was scrapped by developers Virgin in 1997. With legalities causing a problem, an Estonian programmer who can be credited for developing [Skype] and [KaZaA] recoded the game from scratch. The outcome was 'Continuum'. Identical to SubSpace, Continuum was developed with lots of new features such as a banning system known as BanG and is practically impervious to cheats. ; Trench Wars boasts the largest player community in the whole game with 600-700 players online at peak times. Trench Wars has a very intricate [bot] core serving players and adding new features to the game and a strict staff system consisting of 'Zone Helpers', 'Event Referees', Moderators, Super Moderators and Sysops, each with their own monthly quota of tasks to perform such as taking cheater and help calls, hosting different events which change the style of play in sub-arenas and generally being active and serving the community. ; The zone has unique settings and a unique style of play. Players fight to control a flag at the head of what appears to be a base shaped like a castle. This style of play is known as 'basing'. Each ship serves it's own purpose and the idea is that all ships must be utilised by each player in order to capture, defend and control the base.
