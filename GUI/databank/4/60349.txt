Idle RPG
A popular RPG based in IRC. ; Unlike other RPG's where you interact with your character, IdleRPG is a new breed of roleplaying in itself. ; Upon registering, the goal of the game is to sit and idle. The longer you idle, the more experience points you gain and levels you increase. Quitting, talking and the like is forbidden and induces penalties. ; Your character wanders aimlessly around a map with other players in the channel, picks up items, prays to their mystical gods, goes on quests for sacred items and experience and even battles other players. But all you do is sit back and enjoy the show. ; Despite it seeming this game would be boring because of its lack of interactivity, on the contrary it is quite possibly the most entertaining RPG to ever be created.
