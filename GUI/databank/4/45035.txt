minnesota
The best state ever, yes we have the funny accents, and no the state is not flat and prarie like and land of nothing like everybody says, thats only souther minnesota and up by the dakotas, but minnesota is manily trees, lakes, rivers,u know wilderness, its quite lovely. It is manily made up of small iron mining towns, not everyone likes the governor, infact most dont, its just younger people think its cool to have a celebrity, infact i dont like him, he brought our state into a hell hole, and it basically is a liberal state, which is a shame, because mostly everyone here hunts and fishes, and does other sportsmen activities. Mostly everyone here is of Scandinavian descent. And its not a hick state where the hell do people get that from. We have the best weather and seasons, Fall it gets really beautiful out with the trees and is normal weather out, Winter it gets dead chilly and the whole northern state is pure white and looks really nice, and Spring its not the most beautiful looking out manily because all the snow is disapearing and the grass is yellow and its wet out, and summer it gets dead hot out, usually between the 80s and 100s, so we get to experience the best examples of seasons, ice cold winters, and dead hot summers. Minnesota is home to many bands, actors, actresess, companies, and many more, that are huge across the world. Not everyone here plays hockey, but we are good at it, its the best state in the US despite some of inperfections, but every state has them.
