New Jersey Devils
A team in the National Hockey Leauge. Composed of the bitchiest fans in the entire world, the Devils cannot even compete with the New York Rangers anymore. Star players (Martin Brodeur) cheat on their wife, and sell outs are few and far apart. Headed by Larry Robinson, who is openly gay with baseball star David Ortiz of the Boston Red-Sox.
