bloody donkey
An alcoholic party drink made from one shot of tequila and one shot of V8 (tomato juice). The tequila shot is swallowed and quickly thereafter the V8 shot is swallowed. The taste of the tequila becomes neutralized by the V8, and the party goer is left with neither alcohol or tomateo taste in their mouth.
