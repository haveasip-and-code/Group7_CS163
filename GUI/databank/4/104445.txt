the dishes game
A really, really cool awesome super fantastic game invented by the two most awesome ppl on earth where u take part of the lyrics from a song, then the next person has to find a section of lyrics from another song that start with the word the last one ended with. You can't use the same song twice and whoever gets stuck first loses. You generaly play while doing the dishes, thus the name!!
