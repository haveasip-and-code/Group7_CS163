Lupin The Third
vastly popular and ground-breaking manga/anime starring master theif Lupin the Third, grandson of the fictional Arsene Lupin (Arsene Lupin was a French book series that was also popular, yet not half as cool as Lupin the Third). The manga was created, written, and drawn by the genius Monkey Punch (his pen name). also known as Lupin III, or Lupin the III. Lupin was a robin hood of sorts, stealing from mostly rich and the evil. His love interest was Fujiko Mine, a girl who would often double cross him but sometimes would confess love to him, although Lupin never scored with her. Lupin's companions, the expert gunman Gigen and the samurai Goyemon (spelling probably wrong) would often help him with his adventures. Lupin was constantly chased by Zennigata, a cop who's life goal was to catch Lupin. Zennigata was named after a Japanese hero, as was Goyemon (possibly Fujiko and Gigen as well). Lupin himself has become a pop culture icon in Japan and worldwide. The manga would often have Lupin fucking women and cursing. It was because of this that it was considered the first 'adult' in the non pornographic sense manga, and therefore the first intended for adults anime. truly a great series.
