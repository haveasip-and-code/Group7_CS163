Lotus Elise
A very fast, ultra lightweight, aluminum chassis, hand built british sports car that has better grip than virtually anything on the market today (more than an enzo). This machine was designed to own the track, and should only be sold to buyers with a certain degree of driving skill, not posers who just want to look cool.
