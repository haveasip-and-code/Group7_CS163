Tinton Falls
Central NJ, just west of Long Branch, largely characterized by preppy white kids pretending to be black or ghetto, very few of which ever make it out of mommy and daddy's house...college success rate of 1/5....good indication of Tinton Falls residency is that if you actually make it to college, someone who really is black kicks your sorry ass for trying to be.
