Wen Ho Lee
A Chinese-American citizen that was responsible for leaking American Nuclear Secrets to China (The Clinton administration is partially to blame for that) Wen Ho Lee is guilty and there has been proof that he is guilty. He is backed by many of his Red China comrades such as Helen Zia and the Clintons and the people that say 'he is not a spy' and 'free Wen Ho Lee'. He is the Modern-day Chinese equivilant to Julius and Ethel Rosenburg. ; 'Heheh, I said Hoe'
