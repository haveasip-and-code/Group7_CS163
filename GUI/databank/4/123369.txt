Plain City
Home to semi-truck routs, messed up families, and country boys. While these boys can be quite cute, be warned they are jerks. Being raised in these families has not taught them values. They do not know how to treat girl, often causing heartbreaks followed by many excuses. Education is not a proud thing here either. You've struck gold if you man is in college, don't that one let go.
