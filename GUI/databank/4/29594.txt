mary kate and ashley
1)Overrated ; 2)No talent-no acting skills whatsoever. ; 3)Have done no work to deserve the level of success they have-they made 'full house' just because they didn't CRY when they held them up, then they plaed the baby, who only had like 2 lines per episode. ; 3) Had 500 other people guide theuir'careers'. Dualstar was founded and run by other people, but mary-kate and ashley are in the movies, so it's successful. ; 4)same with their clothing line. It was founded and is run by someone else. Once in a while they PICK OUT CLOTHING. THAT'S IT. ; 5)Always makes the same kind of movies with the same plot because they can't act. ; 6)People like them and they are successful only because of their 'good-girl twin' image.
