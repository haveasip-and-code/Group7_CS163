skarmbliss
Call it Skarmbliss, BlissSkarm, Scarmory/Blisey, Metazord, METAKNIGHTDYNABLADE, fugly egg and metal chicken, this pocket monster is a threat to we Pokemon Trainers' lifes. When we meet Johto Pokemon, we also saw new techniques used by those new Pokemon. The RBY era of Speed and CHing was over. However, a new monster invaded our peaceful lifes - known as the mighty BlissSkarm. Some trainers, probably by illegal ways, tamed those beasts and used them in battles. The result was shocking - Nothing could stand in the way of that mighty Pokemon. But some Pokemon evolved to face with the deadly creature as well.
