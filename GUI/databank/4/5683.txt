clancypants
A lie that is told for no conceivable reason. The lie itself is plausible but ultimately unproveable. It disappears as quickly as it is uttered under its own inconsequence. ; Derives from the apocryphal tale that author Tom Clancy was unliked as a child and taunted with the nickname 'Clancypants.'
