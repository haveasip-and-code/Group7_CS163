steamhouse brew
The act of drinking a VERY cold beer while taking a VERY hot shower. ; The secret is to use only bottles and strategic placement when setting said brew down. The small opening and non-water collecting top (like that of a can) allows the beer to be in the shower while taking little to no water in. ; Few have found anything better that didn't involve a sex act.
