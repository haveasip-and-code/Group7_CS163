university of warwick
A British campus university. Based, rather confusingly, just outside of [Coventry] and 10 miles away from Warwick, nearby towns include [Leamington Spa] and Kenilworth. ; Academically sound (apart from Theatre Studies), socially inept and more corporate than [Starbucks]. But it's rich. ; Very large Students Union, lots of waterfoul and a higher proportion of international students than is probably necessary. But they're rich too. ; American Vice Chancellor who wants to take over the Far East and redefine himself in the image of Blofeld before he leaves; but that's OK because he's (probably) richer than everyone!
