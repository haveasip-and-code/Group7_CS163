Heroin accent
The verbal diarrhoea and bizarre speech strong drugs (not necessarily Heroin) cause in [bag heads] and [Chav]s. ; They slur, stammer, and speak from the back of the throat in a strange, zombie like, and above all LOUD voice, with entirely random emphasis, and a truly stunnin use of the word FUCK in all its forms, used where there should have been a pause. All apparently with absolutely NO self awareness AT ALL! ; See Bez from The Happy Mondays for an excellent example!
