Snoopy Shuffle
The term snoopy shuffle is used when you see a dog (more common in little dogs) drag their back two legs across the floor pulling themselves with the front two legs. It basically looks like the dog is preparing for a wheel barrel race. If it is a male dog you can be sure the dog not only is dragging their back legs, but also the satchel area as well.
