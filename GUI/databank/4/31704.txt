Pimpology
pimpology refers to the state of the art of understanding the female psyche to the point of being able to 'pimp' them, and that the man ( or woman ) with the ability to control and manipulate a woman through her choice of prostitution is one who has a degree in pimpology. ; The philology and etymology of the psychology of pimpology, which more often than not is a soliloquy between the supposed pimpologist and their idealized personality: ; This phrase references a time when blacks and others in America were denied formal education and thusly making money was hard scrabble, yet a form of higher learning in its own right, yet working class and poor cultures are seldom afforded degrees or honors of any kind, and thus the word pimp added to ology makes the word pimpology, as a counterbalance to the formal education degrees and studies of ' psychology' or 'entymology', or 'biology' , etc. ; When explaining the pedigree of ones pimpology the old school code was to tell where one is from by noting in explanation where one got ones degree, which was a signifier of social status, and also the depth of ones pimp studies: ; i.e. if one got their pimpology from somewhere in George Bush's Texas,or Dubuque, Iowa, it was a bogus degree, because the ignorance and racism that permeates that culture does not allow for a deep understanding of women, whereas if one got their degree in Chicago Illinois like Flood did, then it is a highly prized degree, because the windy city is a fertile and competitive training ground for hard knocks, and serious pimpology.
