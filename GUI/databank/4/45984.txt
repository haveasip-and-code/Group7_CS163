Branchburg
aka: BBurg ; Bedroom community thats so small and unknown that people from the next town over aren't even sure that it exists. Doesnt have its own zip code, high school, post office, library, or anything except [RVCC]. ; Formerly a farming town, now completely commercial and full of gas stations and smelly trucks due to the fact that all but 2 of the farms are torn down for $1,000,000 houses. The remaining 2 are in the process of being bought by Toll Brothers, who, although they have been to court over it, refuse to give up and let the cows live peacefully.
