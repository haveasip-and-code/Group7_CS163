racists
most of the people on this site are racists towards minorities and incorrectly blame 'all' minorities for what 'some' assholes (so calle 'terrorist') may have done ; most of these racists are also very anti-Muslim and blame Muslim for ; things which they shouldn't be blamed for ; It's hard for some people to separate politics and their political hatred from skin color or religion. ; not all minorities are bad ; Islam has a good message that everyone needs to hear. ; The friggin government rules over people and if you are poor (not like me) there's no way you can affect change. ; You have to work within the rules of the system and if BOTH sides and BOTH political parties have their nasty sides well that doesn't make you or your relgion bad because you have to choose between the two parties both of which have their problems.They are flawed and a citizen is stuck with them and not much else (if you are rich like me) ; SO please don't bash Islam. ; Islam, not like me, is stuck in the middle of 'politics'(politics = multi-sided,blood-sucking creatures) ; the bigotry has to stop
