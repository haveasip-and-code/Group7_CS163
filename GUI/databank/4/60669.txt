west county snob
people living in, or around, the west county area of St. Louis, Missouri. These people think they are smarter, funnier, and much better looking than the rest of the people living in the St. Louis area, and they are in fact correct. They also tend to believe others who live outside the area are hicks, which is another correct assumption.
