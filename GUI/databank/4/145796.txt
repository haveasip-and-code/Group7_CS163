merton
An extremely powerful, yet underrated black magic spell that damages enemies as well as the magic casters and their accompanying party members. The spell typically is an explosive non-elemental 'meltdown' derived from fire, wind, and dark elements. Casting Merton is quite a useful way to eliminate enemies quickly provided you cast 'Reraise' or 'Autolife' on your characters to resurrect them after the explosion. Merton spells typically let off a 'screeching' roar as they destroy everything in their path.
