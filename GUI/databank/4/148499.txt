Money Money 2020
Pretty much the greatest album in the history of ever. It also happens to be a song on the record too. Created by the wonderful band The Network, it takes us back into the future, which happens to be the 80's. With their phenomenal fashion sense and their powerful lyrics, they shall conquer the world.
