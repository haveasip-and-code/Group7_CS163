ocular rape
1. when someone, usually a person, although pop-up ads qualify, forces you to see something that you don't want to see. ; 2. when you go to look at a website or image and the overwhelming sense of horrible design and/or absolute lack of morals behind its creation, makes you reel in terror that your eyes had to go through that trauma.
