cool-aide
A reference to the drink that killed over 900 people in 1978. Followers of Jim Jones, members of The People's Temple, living in Jamestown, Guyana, were convinced, coerced, or otherwise forced to drink cool-aide laced with cyanine and some other fun substances that caused their deaths. ; The term 'don't drink the cool-aide' refers to what has become an almost blind following of faith in government, news programs, corporations, etc. If someone is 'drinking the cool-aide', it means they are swallowing (no pun intended) the rhetoric without questioning the motives. Or, more bluntly, believing the lies they are being told.
