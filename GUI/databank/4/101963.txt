Orlando Anderson
The man believed to have been the shooter that killed 2pac in 1996 in Las Vegas in retaliation for the beating he suffered from 2pac/Suge Knight/and their Mob Piru Blood affiliates just hours before 2pac was shot. Anderson was a member of the South Side Compton Crips (rival gang to the Mob Piru Bloods), but denies it in an interview. He was killed on May 29, 1998 during a shootout in Compton.
