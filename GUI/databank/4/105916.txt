Hard-Fi
UK alternative band from Staines in Berkshire. Released an album in 2005 called 'Stars of CCTV' and a single named 'Hard to Beat'. They came to fame by subsituting for [Simple Plan] on [Green Day]'s soldout tour of the UK. Hard-Fi were booed at the concert in the Milton Keynes Bolw because they suck in comparison to the other bands that were playing. They have some decent songs such as 'Tied up too tight'. Overall a decent band considering they come from Staines like [Ali G]
