THHS ASB
[Trabuco Hills High School] Anorexic Skank Brigade. ; Commonly masquerades as an Associated Student Body - this, however, is a lie intended to lull the populace into a false sense of security preceding their violent take over of all of North America. ; A group of people (term used loosely - some are demonic manifestations) hell-bent on torturing and persecuting the innocent subjects of its parent institution, typically employing loud yelling, irritating snack rallies, excessively loud and shitty music, offensive quantities of smiling, megaphones, balloons, excessive happiness, satanic rituals, etc. ; They are likely to hunt down and survey specific innocent people when 2732 other people of equal surveyability are present immediately nearby. ; Unlike other forms of pure evil, creatures of the THHS ASB cannot be warded off with holy symbols unless said symbols double as heavy bludgeoning devices. However, resistance is futile and all but the most awesome will be assimilated anyway.
