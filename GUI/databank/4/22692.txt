University of Waterloo
A great University if ur in Engineering, Accounting, Math, and Science(Optometry) other then that if ur there ur wasting ur time because it isn't as easy as Ryerson or Xavier etc. and it ranks as one of the toughest universities as it has some of the smartest people in Canada the Engineering and Accounting Faculty's Avg. student has above 90% AVG, most of the people hate it cuz they go there and expect to slack off and receive good marks, but it doesn't work that way, Work hard and get ur reward.
