That's what Rob's Mom said.
Rob's mom, who resides in Winooski, is the hottest piece o' ass in Winooski. As the butt of 'rob's mom' brand jokes, one must take a suggestive or euphemistic line in a conversation and immediately append the phrase '[that's what rob's mom said]' because Rob's mom totally gave it up to Malkovsky.
