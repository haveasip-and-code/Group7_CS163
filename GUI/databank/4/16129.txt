immortal technique
Look Immortal technique is a very good rapper and im a big fan of his. But he is way overatted. To all these clowns talkin bout he's the best ever along with Tupac are morons being is that Tupac was far from the best ever and was also overratted. Any body sayin he's the best out of harlem need to do one thing.....pick up a BIG L cd. I gurentee you your not gonna be sayin Immortal Technique or Pac or any one for that matter is the best ever after you hear it. But any way, I-T is a fun one to listin too, comes with no hold barred opinions on the government and touches many issues, also comes with some pretty nice battle raps. A must hear for any real hip hop fan, if your into chingy or g-unit or that commercial non sense then stay away cause it isnt for you.
