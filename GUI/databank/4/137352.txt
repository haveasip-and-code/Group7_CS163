A dead drop is a location used to secretly pass items between two people, without requiring them to meet. ; Spies have been known to use dead drops, using various techniques to hide the items and to signal that the drop has been made. Drug dealers use this as well. ; A common place is to duct tape the item to the underside of a toilet cover in a public restroom. ; A signal is sometimes used as well to indicate there is something to pickup, like a pile of stones in a certain formation. After checking the drop the signal is removed.
