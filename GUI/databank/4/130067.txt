Furry Art
A type of art that appeals to the bored, perverts of late night television. It is viewed by only the most clever, artistic perverts, with very vivid imaginations. It is viewed by the few that are too cheap to buy it on pay-per-view or those whom are too embarassed to rent it from the movie store. While admiring this furry art, one might pick out a round object that MIGHT be a boob or two objects that MIGHT be having sex. However, this is not for the weak of heart, because one never knows what to expect while viewing it. Sometimes, when the artist has gotten lucky, it is hardcore blurry porno on channel 92, and when the artist has messed up, it is a hardcore, blurry mexican church service. However, on the good days when the artist has found a good art piece, it can be one of the best 30 seconds of that artist's life. [Jill] is usually involved.
