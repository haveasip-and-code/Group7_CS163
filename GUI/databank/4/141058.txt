letum
Letum is obviously a good luck charm when attached to the bottom of a post, perhaps a troll repellent or a buffer against future flaming would be bought on by this seal of Letumness. So from this day forth all posts should be signed with Letum to encourage wealth and well being for all. ; Letum is also Latin for Death.
