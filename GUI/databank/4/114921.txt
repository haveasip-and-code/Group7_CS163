zerg rush
The battle tactic when an immense group of poorly equiped or low -level players/minions/characters swarms a much smaller group of well-defended/high-level characters/players and defeats with sheer numbers. ; Originated from the game StarCraft, in which if timed correctly you could send a dozen zerglings (lowest-level soldier avalible) into the enemy's base before they could make defenses. Spread to include any battle tactic that involved massive amounts of zerglings to overwhelm the enemy's defense.
