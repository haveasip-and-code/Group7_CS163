Hangman
A game in which one player chooses a word, animal, movie title, etc. The name of the 'secret phrase' is not given to other players, but one blank for each letter of the 'secret phrase' is. Spaces are shown, too. The other players have a certain amount of turns to guess what the phrase is, one letter at a time. When a letter that is not in the secret phrase is guessed, a body part (starting with the head, continuing with the body, two arms, and two legs) is drawn on a hangman's noose (I don't know what the stand is called, but the noose is where the head is paced). When the entire body is complete, the player who picked the secret phrase wins. If the phrase is guessed before all body parts are hung, the others win.
