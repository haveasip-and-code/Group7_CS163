Baumer
N. Slang for the biggest badass from SoBe to Tennessee. A true balla that holds it down for all those caucasions out there that gots da skills on the dance flo'. A real player & an all in all smooth operator. Often seen wearing a hat...that I look better in than him. Usually, his coolness is just too much for others to handle... People, even strangers, show him much awe & respect for his mad dance moves. Give the Baumer some room to break lose, but don't challenge him. Acts of dance aggression are not taken to kindly & will require the Baumer to kick your ass.
