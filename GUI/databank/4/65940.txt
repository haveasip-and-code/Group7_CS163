Catholic
A member of the Catholic Church, from the Greek Catholicos, meaning universal. Though often called the Roman Catholic Church, that Latin church is but one of the 21 churches in communion with the Pope, and the Roman rite is but one of the 7 rites of The Church. Though widely attacked for many things such as discrimination, the Catholic Church officially does not teach that if your not Catholic or not Christian you are going to Hell no matter what. Though all salvation comes through Jesus Christ and his Church, they do not say that non-Christians can't go to heaven, and call Jews 'Brothers in Faith' and 'People of the Old Covenant'. The actions of a person or more emphasized in Catholicism than in Protestantism, which adheres to faith alone. Also, the Catholic Church takes a critical approach to Biblical studies, and not everything is taken literally. Tradition plays a huge role in the practices of the Church, and not just Scriptures. Tradition can not contradict scriptures. Mary is not worshipped, she is venerated or honored. Adoration i.e. worship is for God alone. The Eucharist is celebrated at every Mass, and Catholics believe in Transubstantiation. This is the belief that the body and blood of Christ are present in the Eucharist. The Catholic Church has apologized to the Jews formally for sins of Catholics against them, and to the Muslims for the crusades.
