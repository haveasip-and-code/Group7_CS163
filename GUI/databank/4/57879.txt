You're Winner!
1) Derives from the horrible, horrible PC game, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, quite possibly the worst game ever created. When you won (which was every race), a 3 handled golden trophy would come up along with huge lettering 'YOU'RE WINNER!'. When you raced again, the term wouyld come up, even though you didn't win yet. ; 2) Used as sarcasm
