Schnoggles
A term meaning a meal eaten after dinner and before breakfast - usually around 2 or 3 am when an individual is intoxicated or has been up all night and is delusional at the time of eating. One can eat more than one schnoggles in a night, however, it is not recommended due to the fact that you are probably drunk eating schnoggles and could possible throw it up. Schnoggles was coined by Brad R., a University of Maryland student.
