emo jeans
Vacuum-fit jeans that leave no room for a guys' privates to breathe (sometimes cutting off their entire lower-body blood circulation), resembling dark-colored, opaque saran wrap if it were wrapped around one's legs. They are preferred by boys of that kind of style (way of life, fashion, however you wanna patent it), with long, lithe, gamine (did someone say chicken?) legs. Occasionally, you'll see a boy or two with an unusually blessed behind or front, with either of those body parts wanting to pop out of them that you could just swear it would take just one more gait and the thing would rip off just like *snap*.
