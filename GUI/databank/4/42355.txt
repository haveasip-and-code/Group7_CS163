sauce
sauce ; part of speach: suffix ; OK here is the real story of the word sauce. it all began back in the early TV show day for the band Tenacious D. the refered to the word 'Rocketsauce' as in 'you were only rockin, cuz you saw my rocketsauce.' rocketsauce has a more sexual reference than one of awsomeness. the rocket however only served to launch the Sauce in to the sea of slang to hopefully be part of our suffix vocabulary. ; lets face it. words are overused, words like fuck, or awsome, or crazy are overused. they are overused so much that they have lost their meaning, their value, their FLAVOR. overused words are bland, so add some sauce to spice up your vocabulary. works greatest with nouns, can changed them into adjectives if you so desire. replace with 'status' or 'stack' as you see fit.
