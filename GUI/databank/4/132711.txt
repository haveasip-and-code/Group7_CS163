12 oz mouse
A crudely drawn cartoon by the creator of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Matt Maiellaro. There is no feasible plot, but it follows a mouse's life which consists mainly of stealing things, drinking, blowing things up, and attempting to kill his boss. ; Most people hate this show because they find the animation - children's drawings with 2-frame walk cycles - to be really cheap. But some forget that Maiellaro makes the entire show himself, and suffice to say he's not as much of an artist as he is a producer. And Adult Swim isn't much into defining new benchmarks of quality in the animation world either. 12 Oz Mouse has an awkward sense of humor and most will not appreciate it. ; Shows up on the opening credits as [Oz Mo]
