Southern Miss
Southern Miss is the nickname for the University of Southern Mississippi. It's the best university in the state, lacking the rednecks at MSU and the rich rednecks at Ole Miss. Too bad Ole Miss lost Eli, because that's the only football team they could have beat USM with. And as for Miss State, Starkville should be deleted for Mississippi all together.
