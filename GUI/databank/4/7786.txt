tomicon
Ok this is lame. The opinion of one person doesn't nessicerily reflect that of the group that person belongs to. And sometimes people lose friends to other people. That's how life works. It's stupid to take it out on a group of people you don't even know. Get over it. And how can you not expect me to get mad when you say my friends are 'A gathering of fags who suck each others cocks and lan HL2 and other crappy, gay games at the same time.' or 'The Fall Oers. Fuck you, TOMICON bitches.' These people are my friends. I thought most of you people were cool, and I never said anything about Allysa or Rebbeca. It's a shame it had to be like this. We probably could of had a TOMICON, Dynasty, Fall Oer battle or something as some of us are friends with some of the Fall Oers (I don't know if this group is fake to make fun of us or what the fuck).
