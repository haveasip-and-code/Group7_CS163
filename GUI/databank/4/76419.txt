huey robson
The ruudest hardest OG in Parsons Green. Almost always seen with his super rude and rebellious fake diamond stud. Dnt start beef with him cuz he'll beat the livin shit outta of u, or even wrse, get his older, fatter and even harder BIG BROTHER to threaten u, but he won;t beat u up there and then, but later... maybe. If u see the Huey, run away, but b careful not to trip on him.
