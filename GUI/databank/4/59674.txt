salade
(n) A game where you take object like a crushed pop can or a hacky sack, and you kick the object through the legs of another participant. The other players then yell 'Salade' (pronounced 'sal-lad' ) and kick the person until they reach 'home' which can be a tree or a door or a wall, etc. ; (Originally an East Toronto game from the mid 1980's, which is still played today. Usually is banned by the school after a student breaks their arm, leg, gets a collapsed lung, etc.)
