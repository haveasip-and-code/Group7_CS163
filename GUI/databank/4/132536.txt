green lighting
Thought to have been started in the UK by 'chavs'. A man will wear a green shirt with popped collar to show he is free for sex with anyone, be it a man or woman. Anyone willing to join him needs only to approach him and pop his collar down, claiming sexual rights to him. Started a few years ago and has spread slowly and is still largely unknown however many parent groups consider it dangerous and force strict clothing rules upon their kids as a result, as well as telling others to do the same!
