Imberhorny
To be chav-like, but from a middle-class setting. The origin is from Imberhorne school, in [East Grinstead], where there is a high population of chavs from middle-class surburbia. Year 8 alone is approximately 72% chav, whereas Year 11, despite being a lesser 71.6% chav, has even more in the year itself. The word Imberhorny, is therefore to be like and Imberhorne chav.
