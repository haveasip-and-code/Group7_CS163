The Matrix Revolutions
One of the greatest movies I have seen in my lifetime. A fantastic ending to [The Matrix] trilogy. ; Anybody who says it sucks most likely just didn't understand it, being that the writers didn't just come out and spoon-feed us all the answers to our questions. With a bit of thought though, you will find that all the questions have, infact, been answered, which makes it all the more intriguing.
