Krippy
The highest grade of marijuana. This term originated in the southern United States, possibly Florida. Synonyms include [Kine Bud] in New York slang, [Nug],' or [Nuggets], (referring to the tendency of marijuana with a high THC level to be sticky, which causes it to clump together into [Nuggets]) and [Skunk Bud] or [Skunk Weed] (due to the potent odor). ; Some experts estimate that there may be as many as 1,000 different breeds of marijuana that could be classified as [Krippy], although some of the better known ones include [White Widow], [Northern Lights], [New York White], [Acapulco Gold], [Jamaican Red], [Indica], and [Amsterdam]. ; Lower quality grades of marijuana, in descending order, would include [Shwuggets] (something between [Shwag] and [Nuggets] ) [Commercial] or mid-grade weed, [Shwag] (often dryer and containing more stalks and seeds than [Krippy] or [Kine]) and, at the bottom of the chart, [Dirt Weed] or [Headache Medicine].
