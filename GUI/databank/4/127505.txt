weird city
In a generic sense, used to describe something that is curious, or bizarre. In a more specific sense, the term is used to describe an individual with unusual sexual tastes, particularly a female. First known usage was in Woody Allen's 'Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex, but Were Afraid to Ask,' (1972), where Allen, playing the part of an Italian newlywed, confides to a close friend about his wife's inability to become aroused anywhere but in public places: '...my wife is weird city...'
