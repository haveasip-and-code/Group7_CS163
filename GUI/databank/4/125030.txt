The devil
The devil is real. Read the bible and stop believing he doesn't exist. This is what gets people. Christians who claim they don't believe he exists is what destorys your faith from the inside. When he does this, you do all this crap and fall deeper into sin and stop believing in Jesus. All the devil wants to do is drag you deeper into sin and destroy your faith so that you can suffer forever with him in Hell when his time is up. The devil won't stop trying to destroy your faith, he is persistent. He is also a liar and amurder and a thief. He is the father of all lies. You can't fight him alone but Jesus can and he will help you if you choose his gift of faith. Can I get another AMEN?
