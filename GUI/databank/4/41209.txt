Arwen
Aragorn's elven chick. ; Some LOTR so-called fans argue endlessly over Peter Jackson's decision to make her more relevant in his masterpiece films, but its just because: ; a) They are morons and they can't tell their assholes from a hole in the ground. ; b) They are gay and they'd rather see more of Eomer without his mail shirt.
