einhaender
The non-umulaut spelling of the word 'Einha&uml;nder'. Has 2 definitions ; 1- Rough German for 'One-Handed' or 'Sword held with one hand' ; 2- Squaresoft's only side-scrolling shooter, released in 1998, featuring a suicide pilot against the entire Earth military as a recon/destroy mission for the Moon nation of Selene.
