butt-puppet
I saw this word in a chat room in 2003. There it meant a stealthing chatter secretly carrying out the agenda of another- and generally easily recognized- chatter. I believe in the larger sense it has come to mean a person or figurehead who speaks under the direction of another...as though a child's sock toy with someone's armed jammed up their ass.
