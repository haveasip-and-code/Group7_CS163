raisin head
Term for brand new American naval recruits the first few weeks of boot camp at the Great Lakes (Chicago, IL) Recruit Training Center (RTC). The term comes about as new recruits start off wearing black watch caps (knit stocking caps) instead of the classic white 'dixie cup' hat of the traditional US Navy enlisted man.
