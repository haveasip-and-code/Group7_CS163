nub cutlet
Originates in the Uk, this derogatory term marginalizes even the largest of nubs by suggesting that he is not even a full fledged nub, simply a cutlet. Due to its nicer sound with a british accent, this term is not often used in North American online chat, however it has gained popularity in recent months
