A pseudo-elitist who thinks role-playing is a paid-by-the-word novel-writing business. They count post quality by length and adjectives, and will set fire to anyone who posts less than three paragraphs for any reason. They will go on about every minute object in the setting and exactly how every strand of hair on a person blows in the wind in order to get at least three long paragraphs for even a single line in a conversation. They like to say they are encouraging good writing skills.
