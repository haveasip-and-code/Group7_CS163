Otakon
Referred to on its website as 'the convention of the otaku generation,' Otakon began in 1994 as a small covention in PA. Today it calls both the Baltimore Convention Center and 1st Mariner Arena home for one hot summer weekend. It is now the largest anime convention on the east coast, and the second largest in the country. Otakon attracts visitors from around the country and guests from halfway around the world.
