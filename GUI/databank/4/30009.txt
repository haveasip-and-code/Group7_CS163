Duke Nukem Forever
Monstrously-delayed sequel to the popular FPS Duke Nukem 3D. There have been many other Duke adventures in between, developed by third-parties under license, including: ; Duke Nukem: Time To Kill ; Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes ; Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project ; Duke Nukem: Zero Hour ; Some good, some bad. However many gamers want the official merchandise from 3D Realms themselves, and 3DR are simply not delivering. They haven't even released a single screenshot or anything about the game since they started over on the project several years ago. One wonders what on Earth is going on at 3DR at the moment.
