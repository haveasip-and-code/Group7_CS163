kajillionbazillionmillion
A number so high, that there is none higher. It is hard to even fathom what this number looks like, it is so high. It cannot be beaten, so dont even try. No matter how many suffixes of '-illions' that any other number has, this number still exceeds it. (By the way, infinity is NOT a number)
