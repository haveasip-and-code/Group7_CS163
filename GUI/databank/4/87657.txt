lollocaust
A somewhat tasteless portmanteau of the internet abbreviation [lol] and the [Holocaust]. Used either as an indication of extreme hilarity, or, alternatively, a sardonic rejoinder to a failed attempt at levity. An animated .gif file showing [ASCII] men and women being gassed has emerged on [the Internets].
