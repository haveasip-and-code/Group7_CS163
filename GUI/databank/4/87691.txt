the bravery
A poser-esque band from New York that is capitalizing on the success of synth-driven bands such as [The Killers]. The band is headed by Sam Endicott, who likes to talk badly about other bands (examples: [The Killers] and [Duran Duran]) and promote his hardcore image. However, in spite of all of that, their music is still quite good so they are not despised by everyone in the music community. Good for them.
