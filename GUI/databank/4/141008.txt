austnet
The main most popular Australian [IRC] network for [tool]s on the internet. Most of their IRC Ops are idiots who ban every person they can find because they belive it is them who are packeting them. Now they have lost around 5000 regular users due to their banning. If you are going to try and connect to austnet make sure you have set aside a long period of time for waiting, and if you manage to connect usally the next thing you will see is yourself being disconnected by a netsplit.
