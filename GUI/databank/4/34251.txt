hat
A word that is used in place of the word 'virginity', mainly used among youths. ; Although it may seem ridiculous, this novel defence of such usage has been made: ; 'You lose your hat when you go on foriegn vacations, right? And you also lose your virginity when you go on vacation.' ; It should be noted that the only similarity between a hat and virginity is that people do not usually lose either of them on foriegn vacations.
