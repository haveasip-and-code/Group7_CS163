Spooge Rifle
That one gun from Unreal Tournament; it's really called a 'Bio Rifle' or something. It shoots globs of green goo that looks like alien spooge (hence the nickname 'Spooge Rifle'), and then explodes into smaller blobs of green goo. ; The gun has high power, but it travels slow through the air and is easy to dodge. It only explodes if you charge it up, then it's okay if you miss.
