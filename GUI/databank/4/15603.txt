peat
1) Decayed vegetable matter found in bogs and often used for fertilizer. ; 2) Sports lingo for repeat. Typically used with a numeric suffix (e.g. 3-peat, 5-peat) to indicate consecutive seasons said team wins championship game. Invariably when fans predict an (N+1)-peat, the former definition turns out to be more appropriate.
