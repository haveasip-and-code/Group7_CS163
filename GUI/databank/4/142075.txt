The Sub
The Sub is the greatest and most satifying feast a human being could ever experience. A meal so filling that one must hibernate after ingesting it. First you go to Subway and order a footlong steak and cheese with double the meat and cheese on parmesian oregano bread. Next you get grated cheese over the meat and mozzarella on the other half and have it toasted. Add your choice of vegetables and top it off with salt-pepper, mayo and southwest sauce(key). Enjoy! ; Warning: people with heart problems, vegetarians and Bitches should not have The Sub! Fasting is recommended before attempting to finish The Sub in one sitting.
