St. Elmo's Fire
Movie from eighties about a buncha recent Georgetown grads that all frequent a bar called St. Elmo's. Starred Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, etc. In the movie, it explains that St. Elmo's Fire is a natural, atmospheric phenomenom that sailors mistook for lighthouse beacons, thus giving them reassurance that land was close. Something like a security blanket that gives comfort and reassurance in troubling times.
