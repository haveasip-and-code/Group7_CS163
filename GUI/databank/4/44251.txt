Heywood Jablome
Subjects of man-on-the-street interviews sometimes give Heywood Jablome as their name to reporters. If the reporter's a novice and if the newspaper's copy editor doesn't catch it, the name ends up in print, embarrassing the newspaper and the poor scribe who was gullible enough to scribble down the bogus moniker.
