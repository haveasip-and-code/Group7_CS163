Students for Justice
A Communist left-wing organization at De Anza College in Cupertino, California and other universities/community colleges who waste their time protesting against the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, President George W. Bush, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and about raising tuition fees. They basically interrupt classes during sessions to grab students' attention for free speech.
