Flying Scotsman
A sex position in which someone lies on their back with their feet firmly placed on one's pelvis, either side of the penis. The legs are pointed strait up, hoisting one high in the air. One would jizz on one's partner, while wearing a kilt, with one's arms out at one's side, making one, quite literally, a flying scotsman.
