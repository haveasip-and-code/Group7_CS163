Fernand LaChance
Imagine if Yoda and Buddha had a baby. That baby would be the Man, would it not? Well, that is the best way to describe Fernand, the Man. Not only does Fernand do his job, but he does it with the aid of his gravity defying belly. Use caution, as young Fernand is extremely huggable.
