symptonicexplosion
An impulse bomb that blows off and all sound is lost for thousands of miles. Followed by a wave of heat and radioactive chemicals. The explosion itself is so powerful that the location where it goes of turns into a mile wide blackhole. For a split second you can see a mushroom cloud larger than any other, before being sucked into the blackhole.
