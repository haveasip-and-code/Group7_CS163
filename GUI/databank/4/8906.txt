Bel Air
Bel air is full of everything that doesn't really matter. Kids smoke pot and drink since there is nothing else to do. Without your social group are you nothing. ; Some kids are stuck in a world where they're 'horrible' parents pay for everything they'll ever fucking own, but that's just so 'suffocating' so they turn 'badass' by smoking a cig or two and kissing some people of the same sex while they're 'trashed' just so they can post the story and 'pix' all over their 5 xangas and myspaces. ; The 'alternative' group laughs at the whiney spoiled sobs loud enough so they can hear because even if they are stronger because of cheerleading camp, deep minds have a lot of built up hidden rage that would work well in a fight scenario. Even funnier than the rich kids are the ones who trail behind and try to look 'hott' with their extra small Hollister shirts on their large bodies, and label name hang bags. They spend their time talking about nothing, listening to bands that have been somehow pulled from the 'I love unknown bands' wreckage, and hanging at coffee shops. ; The bottom of the pit is filled with ganstas, hard core geeks, goths that live in Spencer's, and whores who are pregnant before they leave the 70 year old hell hole that is bel air high.
