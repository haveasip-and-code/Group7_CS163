no-tell-motel
Any seedy, dirty, cheap looking motel where 'sleeping' doesn't appear to be exactly what many of the people renting the rooms intend to do in them. They usually offer 'hourly rates', for those wanting just a 'quick nap'. If you go to one, bringing your own sheets might be a good idea.
