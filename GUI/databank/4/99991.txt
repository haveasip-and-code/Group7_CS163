LaTroy Hawkins
One of the most hated men in Chicago. He is a relief pitcher for the Cubs who consistently blows save opportunities in the 9th inning. Coach Dusty Baker forces him to be the team's closer against his will, when he has proven he is a valuable set-up man from his time with the Minnesota Twins. ; LaTroy, if you ever read this, when you have a hitter at an 0-2 count, never throw a strike down the middle of the plate. Make him chase one out of the zone, dummy!
