TOD
An acronym for 'Truth or Die,' a game played online amongst friends, usually in a chat room. This game follows the same rules as Truth or Dare, except the 'dare' removed, so that it is only truth questions being asked. ; If you cannot answer a question or refuse to, you must 'die' and be exiled from the game.
