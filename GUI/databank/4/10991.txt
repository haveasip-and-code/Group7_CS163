enhottenate
1. To make hot. 2. To cause an axon in the [ILoveBees] alternate-reality game to become hot. As part of the game, calls are placed to payphones (known as [axons]) throughout the United States. Whenever a player successfully locates the right phone at the right time, answers the call, and answers a question correctly, that axon is listed as 'hot' on the game's website. As axons are enhottenated, clues about the game are revealed to the players.
