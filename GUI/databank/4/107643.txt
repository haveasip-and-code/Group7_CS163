crip side
Not all crip's bang to tha left homiez. I know for a fact that Gangsta Disciples an 52 Hoova Crips bang to tha right. I been bangin for 7 years so I kno my shit homie. Crips bang to certain sides because of an event that happend with one of our King's. I'm not puttin 360 on here an spittin our knowledge cuzz i'm not fake but man tha left is Blood side too. Snoop is not the leading expert on Crips an they knowledge. Snoop aint even a Hoova so shit he cant tell us which side is tha' true Crip Side, Anyways Crip's diddnt bang to a siad until they started populating prisons. There are Crips that bang to the left obviously but not all of them.
