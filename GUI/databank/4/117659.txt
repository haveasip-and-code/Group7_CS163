il Duce
Literally translates to 'The Duce' in English. A name similar to Fuhrer, self proclaimed on Benito Musollini to parallel himself to Adolf Hitler. He was simply Hitler's [bitch], lackey and homosexual love interest from the beginning of WWII to the very end. He was removed from office in 1944 and hid in Italy's mountains for months before being rescued by the Germans. He was shot and hanged upside down in 1945 in a town square somwhere in Italy, nobody really gives a shit exactly where it happened.
