Woy Woy
1) A place on the Central Coast of NSW, Australia. ; 2) An Aboriginal word meaning 'Deep Water'. ; 3) A certain type of [slapper] that comes from Woy Woy, that frequents the Sydney rave and nightclub scenes and whose primary goal is to sleep with as many DJ's and promoters as possible. ; Woy Woys are often unsuccessful, but as the attack method is using massive numbers of approaches to several different people, occasionally some promoter or DJ [wang] is achieved - though no one ever admits it and regrets it the next day.
