butt flakes
A a think encrusted layer of fecal particles that has dried and hardened and somewhat fused with the skin of the buttocks. It results from smearing butt excrement when whiping rather than actually removing it. As it hardens it becomes brittle and starts to crack, then small particles of the fecal-layer waft into the air and can get lodged in people's nostrils or open wounds, causing severe irritation, runny noses and gagging.
