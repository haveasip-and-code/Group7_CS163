bush confidence
The upkeeping and love of your bush (vagina). This includes grooming/shaving of your kitty (again, vagina)and being good to it (when was the last time you got some?) The idea here is that love and attention = a confident, pretty, healthy vagina! Yay. Term popularized by lesbian rights and feminist sexual liberation movements.
