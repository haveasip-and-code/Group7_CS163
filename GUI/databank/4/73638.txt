cross-talk
when you can hera a person or a computer's modem on another line, only you can hear it on your line too. Crosstalk is when another signal on another line is induced onto your line. Crosstalk happens whenever wires in a telephone cable are not twisted/twisted loosely, also happened on telegraph lines earlier in this century (1900's)
