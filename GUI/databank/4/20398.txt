carlsbad
a town with a ton of nothing to do, filled with houses, a few shitty bars, and an airport for rich business types to fly to when they want to wipe their asses with money. the beaches always have losers on them with the occational looker who turns out to be a total retard which is a result of the poor education received at carlsbad high. stupid kids go and look for parties while their republican parents get drunk on over-priced alcohol to make up for their depressing corporate tool lives.
