777
Many believe this number to be a representing of the number of God. This perception is incorrect. This number is actually the mark of the beast, not 666 as many still believe. ; It was a star seal tailored after this number used by the late Walter Crolly to supposedly summon the devil. ; Also, when one consideres the idead of Las Vegas' 'Lucky 7s', the 7 Seals of the Apocolypse, The 7 Deadly Sins, and the 7 Circles of Hell, one must see the blatant connection between the number 7 and evil. ; (see [666])
