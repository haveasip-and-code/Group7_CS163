azn pryde
Unlike '[White Power]' and '[Black Power]' I think it started out as a harmless fad back in the early and mid 90's where, all you had to have to have 'azn pryde' was to be prideful of being an asian no matter what car you drove, or what music and movies to entertain yourself with, now with emergence of Anime and Chinese movies becomming Mainstreme, Asian pride is becomming a racist train of thought saying that Asians are supirior to Non-Asians. As Stokely Carmichael coined the term 'Black Power' I do not know who first coined the term 'azn pride' but modern 'azn pryde' was probably founded upon by Jackie Chan and Zhang Ziyi
