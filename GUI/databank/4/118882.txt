Boy Scouts Of America
Slightly right wing yes, but also a great organization. Since my parents werent big campers, I joined Boy Scouts to learn to camp, backpack etc. It has taught me important life skills. The Boy Scouts have reputation for being freaks which is partially true, there are some oddballs. We are not overly religious
