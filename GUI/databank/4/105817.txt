cornpwn
1. To [pwn] oneself. ; 2. (In a gaming sense) To commit suicide by mistake. ; ORIGIN ; Created by Mic, Justin, and Mike during a trip to Ohio in July of 2005. ; Cornpone is actually cornbread made without milk or eggs. But this has no connection to a cornpwn, so don't try to make one. Do all words have to have a deep meaning behind them? :-P
