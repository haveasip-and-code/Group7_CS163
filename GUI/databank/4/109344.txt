MiseTings
A Magic: The Gathering humor site, originally it was Mike Bregoli (MB)'s blog, which later became a satirical/humor article site similar to [The Onion], but in the past couple of years the articles have been waning, and most people visit solely for the forums. ; Some entries on Urban Dictionary that stem from MiseTings include [Sarnath'd], [Random-Miser], and [soccer mom'd].
