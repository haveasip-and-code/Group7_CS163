penn state
Located in Happy Valley, this small town has a big campus. The students are more than half the population when school is in session and the town is the third largest in PA when it is a football weekend. Don't forget to stop by the creamery, Lion Shrine and say hey to Joe Pa who walks campus every day. We can study, party and drink with the best of them, we just know how to do them all without overloading. ; 'We cannot rank Penn State University against other schools in the party category because we feel it is unfair to rank professionals against amateurs' -Playboy ; WE ARE PENN STATE!
