Michael Schumacher
The most successful driver in Formula 1, bearing literally almost every single record including most wins, most wins in a single season and most championship titles, however, does not hold the all-time pole position record, despite being only one pole away. Won the World Championship seven times, twice with Benetton (1994-1995) and five times with Ferrari (2000-2004). Without a doubt the best driver in his era but has severely lacked competition, which drivers in the '80s and early '90s had to face all the time. Unfortunately Michael barely had time to show his skills in fighting amongst drivers such as Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost but from what he demonstrated he could keep up and sometimes pass.
