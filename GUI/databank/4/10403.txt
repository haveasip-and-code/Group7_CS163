The Fawn
'To Fawn' Doing the fawn, invented by a yound chap named Dav; a hideously effeminate prance across the room with one hand above your head, the other cradled in before the (preferably hairy)hest and one leg cocked coyly in front...inspired by Mr Tumnus. An excuse for otherwise manly men to get all gay
