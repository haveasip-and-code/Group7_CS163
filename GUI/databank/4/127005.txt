anti-alien
The first, last, and only line of defense against that which threatens the safety of this world. Aliens. If there is ever an attack on Earth you can bet this elite fighting team will be there. But you won't see them, you won't hear them, and you'll have no clue that they were there. But you can bet your ass the threat will be annihilated.
