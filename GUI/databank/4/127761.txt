gler
Gler was a young lad from [Long Island]. His real name was Zach but nobody cared about that. To everyone he was Gler. For some reason he would say nothing but Gler, and every word he uttered ended with the suffix '-ler.' Therefor, normal conversations such as 'How about this weather?' would turn into mental shitfests like 'How about this weatherler? Gler!' Nobody liked him, and he had a penchant for talking about some guy who always blew his load way too early (preamler). ; His most redeeming quality is his mother, who is super hot. She is known as Milfler.
