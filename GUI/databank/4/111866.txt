Bodhi
Short for Bodhisattva, from the Sanskrit meaning 'enlightenment-being.' Bodhi is the character played by Patrick Swayze in the movie classic 'Point Break.' He leads a group of rebellious, thrill-seeking surfers who rob banks while dressed in the masks of former presidents. He constantly battles his adversary and protagonist in the film, Johnny Utah, who is played by Keanu Reeves (a shitty actor).
