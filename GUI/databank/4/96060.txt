Trinity College Dublin
University in Dublin, the source of much bitterness by idiots (who don't go there) and who don't seem to realise that it is no different from any other University in Dublin, and that the vast majority of alumni aren't 'west brits' or pompous assholes. In fact, a large amount of students are from the country, or foreign, thus calling them 'west brits' is the height of ignorance.
