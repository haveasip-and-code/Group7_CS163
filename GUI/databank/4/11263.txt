Hocker
Similar to a 'tool,' a hocker is a loser or a jerk. While the word itself is not all that offensive, it is certainly derogatory. Calling someone a hocker denotes displeasure that is often coupled with a lack of respect for that person. Essentially, calling someone a hocker indicates disdain and a feeling of superiority to that person.
