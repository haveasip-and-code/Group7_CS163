Ism
Popular phrase used to describe the toughest of the tough, the baddest of the bad, and the popularest of the popular. While much research indicates that Isms have a tendency to tear their groins (due to masturbation with their mom), street cred that is gained from being referred to as an 'ism' is unavoidable, with many Isms turning suicidal (and in some extreme cases severely homosexual) due to increased public exposure. We, at the Institue for the Advancement of Non-Isms, strongly suggest that you avoid ANY contact with ANY so-called 'Ism'.
