Lebron James
an incredible player that just entered the NBA last season and won rookie of the year. Overhyped before he entered the NBA but has been able to back himself up as a team player and as an individual carrying the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Playoffs with the help of Zydonis Illgauskas of course.
