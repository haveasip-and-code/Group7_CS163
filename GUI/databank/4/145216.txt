you big nasty
Phrase commonly used by pre-pubescent or pubescent boys directed to girls of the same age or older, usually in the Oak Cliff area. It fulfills the boy's need to communicate with a girl, without them actually having to hold a conversation. Said in the proper accent, the phrase is quite amusing. It was first used by Austin Russel, but spread like wildfire when the 8th grade girls began chasing him after saying these three simple words. One does not have to say or do anything 'nasty' to be called 'a big nasty.'
