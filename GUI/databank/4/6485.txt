shoeless joe
Characterized by the following actions (in order): ; 1) Taking crap in a pair of new or gently used shoes and then carefully pushing the crap into the toe section. ; 2) Approaching a homeless person/vagrant/hobo with worn shoes and offering him your 'brand new' pair in exchange for his old shoes. ; 3) Laughing hysterically when he discovers his foot has been [hot karl]-ed and that he no longer has any usable shoes (hence shoeless joe). ; 4) Running like hell before you're beaten to death with a shit covered shoe.
