greasy
The action of being cheap, or unfare. Scenerio: Your waiting for a parking space when someone that knows your waiting for the spot takes it anyway. Now the person that jacked the spot is greasy, or what they did was greasy. It can also be used in a joking manor like 'man your greasy (lol)' and other situations like that. Or if you dont like someone than...'There greay'. It doesnt have to reffer to someone being physically greasy, but emotional, and mentally as well.
