An acronym for 'John Player Special', a brand of cigarette marketed by Imperial Tobacco LLC (Imperial Brands Ltd. in Canada). The John Player Special brand is well known for its less chemical, yet more bold taste than many blends available on the mianstream market. The signature elegant gold lettering on black packaging has earned the blend the nick name 'The Black Death'. Though Imperial Tobacco has released at least red and white renditions of the package (the latter of which was at one point the subject of a massive advertising spree in the UK), the most popular blend and type remains the International Blend, King Size Black (as opposed to American Blend).
