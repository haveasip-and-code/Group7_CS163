gambarize
I will try harder ; I will do my very best ; A word created by an illustrious member of the internet sumo community. ; Its a play on words of the Japanese word gambaru -gambarimasu, a succinct word best translating to 'I will do my best'. ; Sumo Rikishi (wrestlers) when being interviewed often end with Ganbarimasu, 'I will do my best', but when translating to English the feeling in the word gambarimasu is lost, it lacks heart. ; 'gambarize' ; sounds stronger and is a conjunction of gambarimasu and 'ize' in English, (to make more, become) eg: modernize. ; Therefore gambarize means to try harder to do my best and an apt word for the tough training and rigours of sumo.
