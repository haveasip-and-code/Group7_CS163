African
African - some one from Africa. ; African in America is different from an African American/ black American becasue we still retain our culture and language. There is no term for Africans in America, most people use the name of the specific country ie Nigerian -American, Malawian-American, South - African American, rather then the general 'African' for those that are first generation or naturalised. This is so that African Americans are not to be confused with African in America. ; (ie Italian American is used over European American becasue it is more specific),part of the reason people tend to hyphenate the term 'african' is becasue people still tend to see Africa as one large country with different states, as opposed to several ( 56 different countries with distincet cultures, languages, and laws.)
