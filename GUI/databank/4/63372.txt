Black Nationalism
1. Usually misunderstood to be something akin to the African-American version of [White Supremacy], Black Nationalism arose as a political movement in the 60s and 70s out of the belief that America as it existed was an essentially hostile environment for African-Americans and as such, African-Americans should resist integration efforts and seek out a separate nation for itself. Black Nationalists stressed pride in their identity and ancestry.
