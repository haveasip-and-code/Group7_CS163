evolution
A lie. For example, did you know that: ; a)In the early Earth, there was not the right conditions for long enough (if they existed)for life to appear.Jim Brooks mentions this in his book 'Origins of Life' ; b) It has been reported that '80 to 85% of Earth's land surface does not have even 3 geologic periods appearing in 'correct' consecutive order' for Evolution. Recently, fish scales were found in the 'Cambrian layer' when according to the evolutionary column, fish did not appear until much later. ; c) World population growth rate in recent times is about 2% per year. Practicable application of growth rate throughout human history would be about half that number. Wars, disease, famine, etc. have wiped out approximately one third of the population on average every 82 years. Application of this on an evolutionary time scale runs into major difficulties. Starting with one 'couple' just 41,000 years ago would give us a total population of 2 x 10 to the power of 89. The universe does not have space to hold so many bodies. ; d)Rick Ramashing and Sir Fred Hoyle calculated the probability for one cell to evolve by chance. The atheist/agnostic team found to their disbelief that it is 1 chance in 10 to the 40,000th power years just for one cell to evolve. Hoyle said, 'The chance that higher life forms might have emerged in this way is comparable with the chance that 'a tornado sweeping through a junk-yard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein.'
