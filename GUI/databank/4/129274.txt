Slash Thompson
One of THE best lead guitarists of all friggin time. Kicks so much ass that it ain't funny. In my opinion, he is the main reason Guns N Roses was such an awesome band, emphasis on WAS. Now plays lead for Velvet Revolver, another band that is basically this- Guns N Roses-Axl Rose+Scott Weiland=Velvet Revolver.
