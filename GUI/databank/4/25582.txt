chinese
Something or someone originating from China, the most populated country in the world that happens to be communist. Oddly enough, most Chinese are called 'commies' based off the warped opinion of the American liberal media that labels anything communist as 'evil' or 'poor' (with nuclear arms nonetheless). ; 'Chinese' is also a popular term among Americans for anyone that seems oriental to them.
