Bonesword
1. A tool specifically for pwning. Note: Rhymes with pwns0rd. ; 2. Anything that automatically overpowers everything else, with the obvious exception of a [door-hinge]. ; 3. The penultimate rhyming word. From a rap song where 'bone' is rhymed with 'sword'. If bone rhymes with sword, then, with their powers combined...what can't they rhyme with? Second only to [door-hinge].
