red dwarf
Fabulous BBC Sci-Fi Spoof that ran 8 seasons and one movie (more seasons may be on the way?) Following the antics of 'Dave Lister,' the slob/everyman last human in the universe... 'Cat,' A pathologically vain life-form descended from the ship's cat... 'Arnold J Rimmer' An anal retentive hologram of Lister's dead Roomate... and 'Kryten' the insecure android with a head the shape of a novelty condom
