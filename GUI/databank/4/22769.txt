Toorak Tractor
'Toorak Tractor' is the name given to any of the glitzed up chrome-ridden 'soccer mom/mum' SUVs often seen driving around Toorak; one of the more well to do suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. From BMW X5s and Land Rovers to Volkswagen Touraegs and Porsche Cayennes, some of them have the raw ability to navigate mountain passes and some of them don't. The point is that for anyone who lives in Toorak, venturing out into the countryside in their glorified tractor is the furthest thing from their minds.
