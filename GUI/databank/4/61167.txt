Revan
Darth Revan is the most powerful Sith Lord to ever grace the galaxy. He was a [Jedi], but abandoned the Order to join the [Mandalorian] wars in 4006 BBY (BEFORE BATTLE OF YAVIN). He then fell to the Dark side and harnessed the power of the ancient space station built by the Rakatan Empire in 20,006 BBY: The [Star Forge]. His apprentice, Darth [Malak], was also a fallen [Jedi] who followed Revan into the war. [Malak] betrayed Revan from afar when his masters ship was boarded by a [Jedi] strike team in the Bpffash system. Revan then returned and exacted his revenge on his former apprentice. Revan then left republic space, leaving the [Sith] Empire and the [Star Forge] in the hands of his new apprentice: the fallen [Jedi] [Bastila Shan]. Bastila, although powerful, was not strong enough to withstand the corruptive power of the [Star Forge], and many of the [Sith] refused to follow one so young and inexperienced. The [Sith] Empire collapsed into cicil war in Revan's absence, and he disappeared in the Outer Rim. No one know where Revan roams now. REVAN LIVES!
