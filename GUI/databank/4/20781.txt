Episcopal High School
High school in Alexandria, VA where girls get up at 6 AM everyday to straighten their hair, then put on clothing that makes them look like tye-died watermelons or oversized easter eggs. All the guys look exactly the same as well, and after school and on weekends get out their pink polos and skater shoes and go longboarding. Episcopal kids can't play sports, as much as they'd like to think they can.
