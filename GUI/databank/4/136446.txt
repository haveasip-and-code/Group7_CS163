duce's juice
'Duce's Juice' can be attributed to El Duce, the alcoholic drummer and vocalist of the Mentors, a Metal/Punk band. The Mentors gained fame in the 1980s for their lyrics which usually dealt with sex and heavy alcohol/drug use. El Duce was quite fond of [Malt Liquour]. In one 'zine' interview, he claimed to have consumed 18 forty ounce containers of Malt Liquor in a sitting. In April 1997, he was hit and killed by a train, while apparently intoxicated.
