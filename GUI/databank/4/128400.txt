stateing the obvious
To say that someone is doing something which they know their doing but the other person thinks that they are unaware of their own actions for example, 'your useing your calculator'. ; It also means when someone orders someone to do something which is extremly obvious that it dosn't need to be orded like your blind or have a mental problem, like for example, 'throw the ball' when your walking onto a pitching plate in a game of baseball. ; It can also mean when someone repeats what you said like you have a posesed body or you have a memory span of five seconds, usually said to be nasty, for example 'so your saying that you are actually gonna try and get a good mark in that exam'.
