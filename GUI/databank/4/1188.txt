CrushYiffDestroy
Group of furries in denial about their identities, strangely desperate to sought acceptance in any kind of community available and thus try to be furry-bashers, only failing too often to be anything useful. Have unusual habits of congratulating themselves for not doing anything in particular. Sole purpose online is to be mocked.
