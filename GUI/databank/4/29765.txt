A type of weedsmoking device that is similar to a [bong] but made without a gauze. The usual method is cutting a square of tin from a can, rolling it up and taping it together. This is then inserted into a plastic bottle with a little water in it. A plug of [tobacco] is pushed down the pipe and the weed or resin is put on top of it. A [hit hole] is made in the side of the bottle and the user inhales until the whole plug is burning profusely, at which point the hit hole is released and the plug is sucked through down into the water. This causes a lot of smoke to be inhaled at once.
