Spalding Beer
A half empty (or half full depending on how you look at it) can or bottle of beer. Most found during or after private school parties. Occurs when Catholic school boys try to look really cool by saying 'hey brah, I drank like 25 beers last night'...when really all they did was drink 3 sips then put the can down to get a new one.
