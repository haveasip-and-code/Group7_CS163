shoemaker
Lazy, sloppy, incompetent cooks who frequently use short cuts as a substitute for hard-work and skill. Shoemakers are rarely capable of cleaning up after themselves, frequently earning the enmity and contempt of the dishwashers. Always check a shoemaker's garbage bin to see what salable product has been misused, wasted, and hidden to avoid censure.
