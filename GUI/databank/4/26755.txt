knoydart
A remote, wild peninsula on the NW coast of Scotland, between Loch Hourn (Hell) and Loch Nevis (Heaven). Comprised of private or community-owned estates. Access by boat from Mallaig or hike from Kinloch Hourn. Settlements include Airor, Inverguiserain, Doune, and the main settlement of Inverie which boasts the Remotest Pub in Mainland Britain, The Old Forge. Villagers are transplants from all over the world with maybe half of the Knoydart population being actually Scottish. Occupations are usually deer stalking or forestry. Great people, great music, great craic, great heavens what midges!
