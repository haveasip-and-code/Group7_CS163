Pandora's Box
Pandora was a Greek woman with an extremely large box that was frequently opened by all of the townspeople, (even the women), (the women who liked boxes!). Sometimes Pandora would hold large picnics where she would offer her box to everyone. If they were lucky they would also receive ketchup.
