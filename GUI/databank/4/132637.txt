Destrudo
Destrudo is the energy of the self-destructive impulse. It is the antonym of [libido]. While libido is the urge to create, destrudo is the urge to destroy, both yourself and everything around you. It is a less well known life force, and is usually ignored in place of more well known and well defined theories on human emotion.
