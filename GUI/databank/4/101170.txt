shirling
The abstract sport of snake bating. Two teams of five form a circle around a snake, grasping in each hand the wrist a member of the opposing team, so as to alternate. The object is to pull a member of the opposite team directly in front of the snake, so as to provoke it into biting him or her. The game continues until only one member of one team remains uncapacitated, thus winning the game for his or her team. The sport was first conceived of by the 'Kids in the Hall.'
