The Black Crowes
A most incredible rock/blues/boogie band that came out in the early '90's (first cd- 1990). Singer that is absolutely amazing... who happens to be big brother to the guitarist. Switched line ups 3 times. ; Vocals- Chris Robinson ; Guitar- Rich Robinson ; Guitar- Marc Ford ; Bass- Johnny Colt ; Drums- Steve Gorman ; Piano- Eddie Harsch ; Pretty sure that's still the lineup.. I'm positive about Chris, Rich, and Eddie.. ; On tour now with Tom Petty.. GO SEE IT! It's amazinggg. Chris's voice.. INCREDIBLE.
