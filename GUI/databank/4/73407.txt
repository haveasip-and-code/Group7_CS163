nantucket red
Faded red color, a cross between red and pink, associated with sailing shirts worn on the island of Nantucket, MA. What happens when you leave a red clothing item lying out in the sun too long. Not just for WASPy millionaires anymore...any Cape Cod-associated subculture can wear it, albeit in slightly 'different' ways.
