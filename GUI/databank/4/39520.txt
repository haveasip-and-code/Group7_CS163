Anchorman
really funny, yet stupid movie about a self-loving anchorman, an anchorwoman that joins his station, a horny reporter, a weatherman with an IQ of 48, a mildly gay/idiotic sportscaster, a dog that gets punted off of a bridge, a fight between numerous news reporters, and cologne that smells like Bigfoot's dick. it takes place in san diego, california.
