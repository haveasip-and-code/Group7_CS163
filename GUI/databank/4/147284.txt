spindletop
Hairstyle in which hair is slicked back with the application of gel or other product. Most popular with 'Greasers' during the 1950's era. Now only sported by Brian Setzer, Elvis impersonators, and elementary school boys from Texas. Students with this hairstyle often tend to get into fights around the bike racks.
