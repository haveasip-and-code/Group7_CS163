canadian flag
1) The national flag of [Canada]. Two vertical red stripes with a maple leaf in the center. Generic and uncreative. ; 2) Something that [American] tourists do NOT place on their backpacks when they go touring in Europe. The only people poor enough to afford to travel to another country with backpacks instead of luggage are college students and Canadians.
