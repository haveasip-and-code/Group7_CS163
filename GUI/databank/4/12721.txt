Commercemas
New term to describe the time of year formerly known as [Christmas]. This version of the word clarifies the fact that the commercial period is purely about guilting the population into spending money on presents simply to maintain the social status quo rather than actually having any religious connotation whatsoever. Original religious version stolen from [pagan] culture in an attempt to con pagans into technically being Christians if they celebrate on the same day. ; The period generally starts being promoted around July and climaxes on December 25th. One day later retailers generally drop their hiked prices so it's advisable to wait until then before buying anything.
