Hardcore Dancing
Dancing for real because you arent a drunk fucking bum, who smokes, and who lives off their parents money. Because you are not scene, because the scene kids who end up there and drink are found like radar and killed. All kids willing to say otherwise, are now known as 'scene' cause they cant except others, and cant disipline themselves enough to stop stealing their parents booze, and begging the guy right in front of jewel to buy them cigarettes. All you scene kid prep retards, can answer to me, and all the true edge kids, and kids who like music that brings upon truth and reality. ; E.E.
