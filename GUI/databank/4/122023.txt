goron
Gorons can be thought as creatures that live in the video game franchise Legend of Zelda. If a person takes a deper look one can see that they refer to the [beaners] of the video game world. They are dark skined and live in a rural place where they can eat spicy rocks all the time they want. You often see them sleeping, as in the pictures of a Mexican sleeping next to a palm tree. When theres a party, these people know how to party and dance. They live in big families and are often seen selling things. They are the only characters know that immigrated to other parts, and when they do they sell things at different corners.
