Cape Coloureds
A small race of people with mixed skin colour, referred to as coloureds in South Africa. NB: This is a non-racist term. ; Cape coloureds are found in Cape Town especially and are wonderfully vibrant, strong people. A typical Cape coloured speaks fluent 'Kombuis'(kitchen) Afrikaans; this is the informal more English version on Afrikaans. ; They have notible accents, never ever get on their bad side. If you ever meet a bitchy coloured girl or a sleazy coloured guy, you'll know why. They are the toughest race on the planet and can 'wys' you just like that.
