Viva la Bam
MTV series made by pro-skater & former '[Jackass]' star [Bam Margera]. The series follows Bam & the West Chester crew through their unreal lives as they pull pranks on friends & family, & wreak havoc on the general community. ; While many people consider this show very funny, it has many detractors & is definitely not a show everyone will like, much like it's MTV relations, [Jackass] & [Wildboyz].
