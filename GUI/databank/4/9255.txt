AmeriCorps
U.S. domestic peace corps, paid in stipend by a congressional act signed in the early Clinton years. Major function is training, community policing, health education, and community service leaders. Would potentially satisfy national service requirements for [conscientious objectors] in case a military draft were to be instituted, much like the Civilian Conservation Corps of old.
