System of a down
Okay people, before just saying the band sucks in the description, learn some punctuation first. Also, get your mothers to help you put some sentences together and to learn how to spell...christ... ; System of a down are an amazing band of Armenian descent. With each new album they try to combine different types/genres of music to appeal to lots of different types of people. Indeed, some of the songs lyrics are mad/funny, but the majority have deep meanings to them.
