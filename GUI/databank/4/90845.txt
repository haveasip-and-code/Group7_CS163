partylining
When someone shares the same plane of movement with you in a paralell manner, usually very annoying. Happens mostly while driving, when one drives next to you, speeding up as you speed up and slowing down when you slow down, preventing you from changing lanes. Also happens while walking down the street, waiting in line, or jogging somewhere populated.
