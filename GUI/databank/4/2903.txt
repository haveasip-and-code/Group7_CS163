Ontario
The largest province in Canada by population and the the second largest by size. Located west of Quebec, east of Manitoba, and north of New York State, Michigan, and Minnesota. Ontario is the economic engine of Canada and home to Canada's largest city, Toronto. Other large cities include Ottawa (the national capital), Hamilton, London, Kitchener-Waterloo, and Windsor. ; Ontario is economically and ideologically split between the populated, urban, and wealthy south and the vast reaches of the northen part of the province. ; Most people from other parts of Canada think Ontarians are arrogant wankers that would sell their own mother for a quick buck or a blow job. However, most of these criticisms come from people with small penises and no balls.
