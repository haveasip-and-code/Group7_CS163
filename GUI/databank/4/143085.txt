Killing Ifrit
A haven for the pitifully devoted portion of the [FFXI] community to vent their juvenile frustration over trivial occurrences in a video game, such as [KS] and [MPK]. Participants in these dramatic forum conflicts are predominantly comprised of academic failures, people with little to no social dominance and those who value pixels over reality in a somewhat similar vein to a [technosexual].
