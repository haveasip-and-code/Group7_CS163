teen titans
A show made for younger audience but watched by many older audiences. ; I find it funny how people bitch about this show using japanese animation, even though the japanese people borrowed from our animation first. This show wasn't made for the wapanese, fuckheads. This isn't the first show to borrow certain styles from other shows.
