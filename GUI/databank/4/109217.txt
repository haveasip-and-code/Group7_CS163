it was one of those 24 hour things
1. Originated nowhere in particular. Whenever you think about it, you automatically think of a one night stand that lasted pretty long and was apparently very good. ; 2. Whenever you went out with someone immature, [fugly], hideous, or embarrassing in any way and you really can't avoid the fact that you actually went out, 'it was one of those 24 hour things'.
