Vom Watch
An organisation created by St Aidan's College, [Durham] to prevent the destruction of their own college due to the acidic, stella artois and 'dirty shop' kebab saturated puke that seemed to be deposited everywhere. The mission of the Vom Watch was to name and shame any fresher who soiled the college carpets with puke and to ensure the cleaning bill was kept to a minimum.
