Nova Scotia
Greatest & most beautiful province in Canada. No people, we all had to go to Boston to find work, but the most breath-taking scenery in the world. Too bad we're continually screwed over by a**hole politicians in Ottawa, and powerful interests in western Canada who sh*t on us. Nova Scotia (and NB & PEI) are even more isolated from the rest of Canada by those crying limp-wristed pussy frogs in Queerbec who won't stop whining, so pretty soon we'll have to join the U.S. and become the 7th New England state. They do more for us than the rest of Canada anyway. Hell, we're already part of Red Sox Nation. We'll NEVER be fans of the Blow-Jays or the not so dearly departed Expos. Nova Scotia rocks, the rest of Canada can kiss our asses.
