The Mafia
A bunch of vacuous, self-important, anti-social cunts who, because of their refusal (read: inability) to interact with anyone in their own year group, have broken away and formed a tragically un-hip and un-happening little clique. Very reclusive and potentially dangerous. Their homophobic, racist and quasi-fascist adherences are particularly offensive (or hilarious, depending on how you look at it).
