tuna suprise
When one orders a tuna suprise at a vending machine this is what happens... ; 1) You put your money in the machine and press the corresponding number. ; 2) Nothing. Nothing happens for about 90 seconds. Most people will think that the long wait is the suprise and as they are about to turn away... ; 3) An arm hoding a large fish appears from the vending machine and slaps you, and a voice says 'Suprise bitch!'
