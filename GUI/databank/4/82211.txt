foghat
(1) 70's classic rock band ; (2) A word made up by Dave Peverett (the lead singer of the above-mentioned band) in a game of Scrabble he played with his brother, in which Dave insisted it was a word. While it wasn't a word at the time, it later became the band's name which, to some, may now be an acceptable word for the popular crossword board game.
