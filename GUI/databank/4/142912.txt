SOT
Acronym for Soap Opera Twink. Term used in the gaming community for someone who engages in overexaggerated drama roleplaying. Common roleplaying themes for SOTs: placing themselves as the victim at every chance, hopping from one overblown romance to another, and anything that puts them in the spotlight.
