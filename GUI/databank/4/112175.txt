Fred Norris
The remarkably talented sound effects genius behind [The Howard Stern Show], Norris provides absolutely hilarious sound effects throughout the show's interview segments in lieu of actually verbalizing. Many times, Norris is not heard from for the entire show. ; 'The King of Mars' is easily the most enigmatic members of the show... his real name is Eric yet nobody knew.
