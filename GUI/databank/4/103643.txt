T-Virus
The T-Virus is a mutagenic toxin, altering the host's chromosome structure on a cellular level. More than likely, it will kill its host, then reanimate its corpse. It is an inter-species infective, capable of amplifying in plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, whatever. In some cases, it promotes incredible growth; in all of them, violent behavior. The virus also infects brain chemistry, at least in humans-inducing something like a schizophrenic psychosis. And it also inhibits pain. Victims of this virus barely react to physical abuse, and although the infected decay physically, they barely seem to feel it. ; The best way to become infected with the T-Virus is to be bitten by an infected host, who will become bloodthirsty and will more than likely attack you of you are nearby. Avoid contact with a host at all cost, whether it be a friend or family member
