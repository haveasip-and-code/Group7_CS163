A noun or adjective describing a person, usually male and under the age of 18, who is quasi-suicidal because mom asked him to clean his room. He holds his friends hostage with his unending threats of self-termination, and maintains a LiveJournal into which he posts some truly hideous poetry. He is only truly happy when he is sad and when all his friends have been driven away by the imaginary black clouds over his head.
