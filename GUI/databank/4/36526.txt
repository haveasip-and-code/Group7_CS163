crucifixion
The act of placing a person on a wooden cross as a means of execution. The person would usually be tied to the cross, but sometimes if the Romans considered the person a really bad criminal they would nail the person to the cross. The person would linger for a time before dying from shock and exposure. ; Crucifixion was practiced by the Romans as well as other cultures. It is considered one of the most brutal and painful ways to carry out an execution.
