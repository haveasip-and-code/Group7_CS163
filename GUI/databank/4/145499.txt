Saline
A town outside of Ann Arbor which is dominated by conservatives and farmers. Even with the liberal college town right next the majority of the people are rich white conservative tools. The actual town has a small strip of life where a McDonalds, Wendy's and the Drowsy Parrot a popular coffee shop can be found. And the school system is in dept after building a huge but boring new highschool.
