People who beleve they have the spirt of an animal trapped inside them. Most of them just make this stuff up to get attention from furries cause they really are furries but some really beleve in and want to be an animal. I think it is just their warped thinking and scarred mind. Beleve me I once beleved I had a spirt of a wolf trapped inside me but I realize it was just teen angst and anger. I am human and happy to be so as I can do better and funner things than animals can do. Why the hell would you want to be an animal if being a human is easer, safer funner and overall better. Human stress I guess. But they will get over it and live a normal human life.
