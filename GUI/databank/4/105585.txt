cabbage night
A term for the night before [Halloween] used in Vermont. This night is referred to as [mischief night] in many parts of the United States. On Cabbage Night, children who live in rural areas (i.e. the entire state) go out into the crops and collect rotten veggies. Then they go to the homes of prominent people in town: wealthy old spinsters that don't out candy, the town banker who forcloses on family farms, or the fucker that runs the general store. Don't get me started at that sum bitch. He thinks he can get a buck fifty for a fucking pepsi. All he's gonna get from me in a cabbage through the windshield of his Dodge.
