poop-in-the-john
similar to the act of a jack-in-the-box, but rather when one flips up the toilet seat and finds a disgusting piece of old, yellow-brown, shit sitting at the bottom of the comode; this is usually done as a joke to show off your big load to a friend or relative, and is very rude because they didnt flush it down
