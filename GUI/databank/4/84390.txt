Kano Sisters
AKA Kano Shimai. ; Japan's answer to the Hilton Sisters, although neither of them are as irritating and overexposed as Paris, and they've been around for a few years. ; Multitasking between acting, singing, modelling and generally turning up everywhere, Mika and Kyoko are at the pinnacle of Japan's star system.
