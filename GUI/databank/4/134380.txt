freecycle
The phrase Freecycle(TM) was coined by Deron Beal in founding The Freecycle Network(TM) on May 1st, 2003. This nonprofit network of over 3000 local groups allow individuals to gift items otherwise headed for landfills to each other online and locally. It stands for a free cycle of giving, or also free recycling. As a result over 170 tons a day are being kept out of landfills.
