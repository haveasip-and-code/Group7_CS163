Tourkinson's Diseasyndrome
The funniest syndrome known to man. The terrible combination of Tourette's Syndrome and Parkinson's Disease. The person exhibiting signs of Tourkinson's is known to sit in place fidgeting wildly while either clapping, making random sounds, saying off-the-wall phrases, or cursing uncontrollably. ; A patient with Tourkinson's Diseasyndrome can be called a 'Tourker' for short.
