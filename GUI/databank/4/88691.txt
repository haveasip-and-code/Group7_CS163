2Pac
Until recently, I used to listen to Eminem, like everyone else in my school. Then one day, I realised, 'This music is shit! Why am I listening to this?' ; This lead me to realise something: White people can't rap. I'm white myself, but I realise there are some things which certain people are destined to do. Rapping is something that black people are destined to do. Now I listen to Eminem, it just seems... well, wrong. ; Looking for someone new to listen to on my stereo, a friend of mine introduced me to 2Pac. It's not that I hadn't heard of him before, I just hadn't really listened to his music. My friend played it, and I felt myself completely lost in the music, a sensation I'd never felt with listening to Eminems music. Straight afterwards, I got the album my friend had got me, '2Pacs Greatest Hits'. I listened to the album constantly for 2 months counting. Seriously, if you don't listen to 2Pac already, go out and buy an album of his. He really is a legend. A lot of people still reckon he's alive, but I think he's dead. It's a sad fact that such a great talent died so young, but his music will live on for generations to come. ; At time of posting, Ghetto Gospel is going to be released soon. Go out and buy it. I know I will. Really, 2Pac was sheer genius. Why do you think all the defenitions below say stuff like 'Greatest Rapper Ever','The leader of this rap shit' etc. But don't take our word for it. Go out and buy a 2Pac album. ; The best rapper who ever lived. ; Period.
