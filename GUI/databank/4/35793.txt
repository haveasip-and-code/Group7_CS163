shakira
Unbelieveably talented. Voice almost like Christina Aguilera, Dace skills rival Beyonce, Incredible stage presence, writes her own songs, produces her own songs, AND plays guitar. Plus her style is so ORIGINAL- from her sound to her performances to her look. And she's also gorgeous and a sweet girl with a nice personality.
