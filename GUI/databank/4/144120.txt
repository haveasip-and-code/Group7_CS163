schwoo
'Schwoo!' is a spontaneous exclamation of extreme [LSD] intoxication. Pronounced with much breath, as blowing out a candle. Repeated as necessary. The proper reply to such a statement (assuming similar intoxication) is also 'Schwoo!' ; The 'Schwoo!' statement is both a statement of 'peaking' and an attempt to lessen the hallucinations.
