themo
(adj.) properly nerdy self-conscious emo: ; 1. for those people who want to be emo, but aren't, because simply wanting to be emo disqualifies you; you must just 'be' emo. ; 2. for those who just 'are' themo (they often do not understand the category) ; However, for many, becoming 'themo' is an art; one must dress, [taylor hanson] style, utterly dorkishly, as a [nerd], wearing unnecessarily geeky glasses (like Willy Mason) and mile-long scarves and being so hip you're practically prosthetic. ; Themo kids are into music by bands either far too cool or far too ugly to sell records.
