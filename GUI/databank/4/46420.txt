Fear Factory
Industrial metal band that started out being a boderline Death metal band in 1991. Their vocalist, Burton Bell, was the first to introduce both death metal growling and switching to clean vocals. Fear Factory evolved into a sharper, more aggressive sound, and progressed from death metal to industrial with hints of techno here and there. They focus on how humankind is too addicted to technology to the point of being helpless without it, and see technology as the eventual downfall of humanity.
