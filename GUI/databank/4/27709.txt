Rescue Me
An FX show about post-9/11 firefighters in New York. [Denis Leary] plays Tommy, a veteran firefighter who can't seem to move on after splitting up with his wife and the tragedy involving [9/11.] It's a great show that combines tragedy with gut-busting laughs. You already know Leary is a funny guy, but he proves to be a talented actor (and writer) as well.
