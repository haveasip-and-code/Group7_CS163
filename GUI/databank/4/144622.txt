pavies
The term used in Ireland sometimes to describe female [knackers]. Basically girls with gold hooped earrings (the bigger the better), hair pulled back so tight it stretches their face, cheap clothes from penneys/primark and usually a baby if they're over the age of 13. Be careful if approaching them.
