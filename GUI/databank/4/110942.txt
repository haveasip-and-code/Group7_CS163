Pitman
Pitman is an ex-miner turned MC. Aparently originating from Coalville, Pitman breaks down the boundaries of conventional hip-hop, with his rhymes about tea, biscuits, and waiting in queues. On the surface an angry man, Pitman himself says he is 'misunderstood', and is actually a very happy person. Pitman has spoken out about many issues he feels strongly about, most notable claiming Usher has a 'peanut head', J-Lo a 'Massive plate face' and saying Craig David has 'A big fuck off chin'. Although playing Glastonbury this year (2005), Pitman has on previous recordings claimed that Glastonbury festival-goers are ' a bunch of virgins in a big field with no mates and no toilet roll'.
