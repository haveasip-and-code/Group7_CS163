Hood Rats
This is an ancient word, which comes from Egyptian times, it derived from when hoods were placed over the faces of the dead leaders before they were mummified, however, sometimes, while waiting for embalmment, rats would get into the room and start eating the deceased one. These were the 'Hood rats'. This word was left undiscovered till the early 21st century when some one from the British Museum found the word on the Rosetta stone and decoded it. He then found that the word fitted in with [Chav] so he used it in common speech.
