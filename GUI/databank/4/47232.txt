GSS
GSS is an acronym for golden shower syndrome; this is a syndrome commonly found in Asian women. It occurs during sexual intercourse when your female partner loses sense of her bladder valve. As a result of this, urine will be discharged through the urethra onto her male partner, thereby owning him.
