aboboongicoon
An indigenous Australian. Originally hunted for sport by European settlers, aboboongicoons were declared an endangered species by the p.c. police in the late 1970's. A furious effort of reproduction through inbreeding over the last 30 years has seen sales of methylated spirits sky-rocket, supporting a booming oil and gas exploration industry in the Timor Sea.
