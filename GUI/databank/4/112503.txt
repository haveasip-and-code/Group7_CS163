102.7 KIIS FM
Known in Chicago as 103.5 Kiss FM, it is a radio station that plays pop, rock, and rap. Mostly pop and rap. They have about twelve songs that they play, which they play constantly. Sometimes they get some good alternative songs, at least a month after they were number one on the countdown. This tends to ruin them and let all the people that would normally never listen to the band act like it's their favorite group. Some examples are Papa Roach and Green Day...
