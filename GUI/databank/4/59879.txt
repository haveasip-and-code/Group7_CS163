FOX
1. A strange public television channel (used to be my favorite) that used to have good shows (futurama, family guy, john doe, andy richter, greg the bunny...) but now is mostly crappy reality shows, bad ideas no one else would take, [american idol], [the simpsons] and [that 70s show]. That 70s show is actually one of the few things they show that's actually good. On the other hand, they've either showed or greenlit and then dropped at least 3 shows that have been taken up by [adult swim], some quite successfully. ; 2. Used to describe someone, usually female, as incredibly attractive.
