metropolitan innundation syndrome

Symptoms include disorientation, slow reactions (as they are unused to the faster pace of life), respiratory problems (from polution), hearing loss and/or tinitus (caused by city noise), and eye strain (from excessive light exposure). ; The second manifestation occurs when a city-dweller travels to suburbia or a rural area.
