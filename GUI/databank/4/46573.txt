gettin knowledge
means the same thing as gettin head, gettin dome, etc. Sometimes gettin head is called gettin brains, and this led to 'gettin knowledge' because brains=knowledge. Jadakiss used this in 'nasty girl' when he said 'since she a good girl that attend college, i don't let her gimme brains, i jus let her gimme knowledge'.
