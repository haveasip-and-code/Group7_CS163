Goating
The act of going into a public place ( usually a bar )with a bluetooth enabled device, scanning for other bluetooth enabled devices that openly accept transfers, and sending them a copy of the [Goatse] image. Looking around to find the target after the image has been sent is known as Goatspotting.
