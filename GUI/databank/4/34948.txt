bose
A fancy schmancy audio company. Their headphones are pretty sweet and the sound cancelling tech is top nontch. But, for some reason, they seem to market primarily to the elderly. As a result, their products such as their Wave-Audio(radios with tubes-n-shit in them) tend to have heavily simplified controls, bland styling and automatic equalizer settings that only sound good with classical music. Despite having some good ideas Bose also is technologically conservative; with products not being MP3-capable years after everyone else is. Lasers used in CD players are also weak and cannot read through scratches that others could. Overpriced? Probably.
