final fantasy 12
A game that is due to come out shortly. It doesn't look like that it will be as good as FF6, so I won't buy it. ; Let's take a game that looks good that that will also be coming out soon, [suikoden 4]. ; First of all, the Hero of suikoden 4 looks more like a dude than Vaan. Vaan is uglier than someone's ass hairs, from where the Hero of Suikoden 4 isn't ugly at all. ; In FF12, your going to get a crapy amount of allies, it's like 4 or something (maybe square will get daring and put more than 10 characters). Where in suikoden 4, you will be able to gain up to 108 allies. ; If you look at the Hero in suikoden 4, he is very tough and strong. Vaan probably would loose an arm wrestling match with a lady bug. ; After taking the time to think about FF12, it will be obvious that FF12 will not be as good as previous FFs.
