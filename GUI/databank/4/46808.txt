beboppin
Beboppin is the act of walking or moving around campus/downtown in a very specific manner. Not only does a bebopper know that they are better than everyone else, they also know that they is no other way. Beboppin takes practice and CANNOT be achieved by just anyone. It is an art form that originated in Charlottesville, VA then traveled to Charleston, SC and now is rapidly taking over the world one college campus at a time. The physical art comes naturally once the mental state is found. ; Also, if one is lucky enough to find 'bebop' jeans and rock them while beboppin, they truly have reached beboppin euphoria.
