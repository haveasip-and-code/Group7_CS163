Twinkerbell
'Twink' is commonly used to describe young gay airheads, equivelent of a blonde bimbo. 'Twinkerbell' goes on to further label an evolution of the stereotype that minces around in fairy outfits at the slightest excuse claiming it to only be 'a good laff'. Often these types are in denial about their true sexuality.
