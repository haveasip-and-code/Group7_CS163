anticon
1. Makes all of these dumb-ass, neocon, airhead, suburban, white-boys (who pretend to be gangster and black) really angry and defensive because the label can actually put out music that isn't just about either how much money they have or how many prostitutes they fuck. ; 2. Not necessarily hip-hop, but rather a new form of music that can be appropriately called 'post-hiphop'. Formed out of a growing discontent with the sheer homogeny and 'status quo' elitism that has become the essence of mainstream rap.
