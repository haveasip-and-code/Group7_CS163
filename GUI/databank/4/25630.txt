Ecstasy
1.to be really, really happy ; 2.a drug that causes you to be really, really happy, usually resulting in saying 'i love you' alot and a desire to kiss and have sex with everyone in the near vacinity. of course, anything that good has to be shitty, so usually if you have a cold, or feel under the weather, ecstacy makes you die. have fun ravers!
