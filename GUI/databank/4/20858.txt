no truck
To have no truck with someone or something is to want nothing to do with her, him or it. ; Appears to be derivative from an archaic meaning of 'truck' which can mean 'to trade or barter'. ; Some dude just told me it's obsolete, but I use it anyway. And I've got no truck with people who say it's obsolete.
