nappy meal
A term used to describe any meal that one feels is sub-par or bad tasting. This term has nothing to do with African-Americans (some think so because of the arguably derogatory nature of the word nappy). ; Grammatical rules are generally very relaxed with this word, as it can be used to describe a restraunt/eatery that serves food that one believes to be unsatisfactory. ; Also, on occaision, this word can be used to describe people (most often females) whom one may deem [fugly] or aesthetically deficient. This useage of the word is debateable, as it would imply this person tastes bad, which may or may not be true.
