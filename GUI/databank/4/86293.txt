Knowledge Management
Knowledge Management (KM) is a discipline of management supposedly dedicated to ensuring that people in an organisation have timely access to the information and expertise they need to do their job. In reality, KM is a discipline full of semi-literate twats who like to use big words. They say things like 'We're going to strategically align our knowledge resources with the company-wide strategy going forwards','We're moving into the client space', 'I'm mostly working on the growth pillar to add value', and 'Going forwards, we're working on a P2P strategy to add value and capture tacit knowledge.' In English, all of this roughly translates into one sentence 'I'm a giant wanker who produces no meaningful work and talks a load of shite. Senior managers love me because I sound good to other people who only have a fourth grade reading level and are impressed by big words'. ; KM adds nothing useful to any organisation, except where they have managed to take over research and subscription services or database management. In which cases, the managers take all credit for the work done by their lowly minions, thus further convincing senior management that they 'add value', when the reality is quite the opposite. Any cost-cutting exercise in any large organisation should start by savagely slashing the senior KM people - let the minions report to each other and you'll probably get a lot more done anyway.
