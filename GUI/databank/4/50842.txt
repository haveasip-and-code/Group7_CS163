pasadena
Pasadena..otherwise known as 'the dena' has two things. Gas stations and grocery stores. There's basically nothing else except a few fast food restaurants and the roadhouse. Our schools suck and most of them are poor as God knows what and there's absolutely nothing to do when you're bored unless you wanna go mini golfing. The Dena is chock full of rednecks, preps, wiggers, and posers. A lot of people hate it here....but a lot more of us like it. Mind you..we don't like it enough to stay around and raise our kids here.
