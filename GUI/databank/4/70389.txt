lower merion high school
While I would hesitate to call Lower Merion a vanguard of cultural and economic diversity, it is an excellent high school for those not lucky enough to attend one the fine private institutions forming the lovely young adults such as my fellow linguist above. Large, wealthy, and full of activity, LM is a public high school somewhere between Newport and Chino, but 100% Main Line. ; P.S. Of course, if you're ever in need of barbituates or stolen Malibu rum, you'll want to try Harriton.
