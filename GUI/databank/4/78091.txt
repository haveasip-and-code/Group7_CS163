Golden Eagle
On August 17th, 1936 the Anheuser-Busch brewing company created the first canned beer. It came in a golden can and abandoned the A-B logo with the A & Eagle logo, a red circle with black eagle claw lines. Recently Anheuser-Busch returned this legendary beer to the market with its packaging basically intact. It is crisp and rich and possesses one of the highest [chugability] factors known to man.
