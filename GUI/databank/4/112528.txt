flying while Muslim
A phrase coined after the September 11 attacks. Basically it describes a situation that Muslims claim to experience when flying. Basically Muslims are being profiled and have extra security measures taken before the are allowed to get on a plain. Due to the fact that all of the terrorists who high jacked the plans were from a misguided and insane sect of the Muslim religion. That does not know the true meaning of the Koran.
