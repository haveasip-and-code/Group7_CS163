Fake Bling
Something of an oddity, & as far as I am aware, a rarity. Whilst most [Chavs] enjoy an unhealthy dose of jewelery/gold plated jewelery, those wearing Fake Bling are in possesion of a poor quality, cheap attempt at [Bling]. Fake Bling is often plastic, hollow & adorned with plastic diamonds & gold paint, one such example was a plastic padlock, that lacked a back, was painted with sparkly gold paint & worn in conjunction with a potentially real gold necklace by an extremely [mo mo] chav.
