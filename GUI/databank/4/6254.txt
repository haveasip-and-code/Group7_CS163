suite
The larger, usually handicapped-accessible, stall in a public restroom. ; Aptly named for its luxuriously spacious accomodations, the suite is the prime location for mid-afternoon restroom breaks at work or school. ; Almost exclusively located on the end of a bank of stalls, the suite ensures its occupant the utmost privacy, as he or she will never be subjected to more than one adjacent occupant.
