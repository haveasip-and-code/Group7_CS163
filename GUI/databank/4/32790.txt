Buzz Bunny
The new name for Bugs Bunny in the cartoon Loonatics by WB. It's hated by older audiences due to the change in design of Bugs Bunny, but with animation similar to Teen Titans, it might be a success. Buzz Bunny has a new menancing look that compares with that of Shadow the Hedgehog (Sonic Adventure 2/Sonic Heroes).
