Text talk
noun (tehxt torck) or (txt tlk): Uses: Mobile phones and MSN Messenger. The most annoying form of speech ever, more annoying than [French]. Widely ununderstandable, it abreviates as much as possible leaving a code which only the author can decrypt. Though it does help the author write it quickly, the recipient must undergo strenuous investigation to be able to reply in an equally confusing manner untill the competition of [confusosity] gets to such a point, that their grammatically incorrect minds explode a little more.
