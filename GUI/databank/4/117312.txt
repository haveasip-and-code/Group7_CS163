Adrenochrome
Adrenochrome or Andrenichrome is a made up drug by Hunter S Thompson used in the movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. ; Near end of this film, Duke takes too much 'andrenichrome' and has a nasty experience. Andrenichrome was a substance that Hunter S. Thompson made up for the book when he originally wrote it, and was kept in the script by Terry Gilliam. After showing a rough cut of the film to a test audience, Gilliam was approached by a group of young men, one of which complimented him on the film in general, but said that his favorite scene was the andrenichrome scene. He said that he had used the drug and that Gilliam had captured the effects perfectly. Gilliam didn't have the heart to tell the kid that it was made up, and went along with his story.
