Will Paget
A dopey giant who is scared of people twice as small as him. He is also an Arsenal fan and wonders around North London trying to be a skiv and trying to fit in with the gangsters in the hood, by talking like them and memorising their songs. However in a few years with evolution the Paget will realise his destiny and support Chelsea. He originates from North London.
