McJob
Taken from the 'Mc'-based spelling of most menu items at [McDonalds] (e.g. McChicken, McFlurry), a McJob is what a McDonald's employee has. ; Contrary to popular definition, jobs at McDonald's are not low paying nor dead-end - from the looks of things they've really shaped up, since it's the only thing a high school or college GRADUATE can get these days. Even if you're an experienced PHP programmer, video editor, and computer technician, the best job you can get these days is 'flippin' burgers' at McDonald's. ; Of course, the term applies to an employee of any fast food restaurant, though the slang term now applies less to McDonald's employees, but more to farm workers, immigrants, and other people who can do nothing more than bang their chest and grunt. They get McJobs. Not McDonald's employees. ^-^
