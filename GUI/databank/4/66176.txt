SR-71
The Blackbird is a titatnium-skinned, supersonic spy plane created by Skunkworks in the 1960's. Reputed to attain Mach 3+, it has also set the altitude record for a jet powered aircraft. Highly successful photographer of the Soviet Union in the Cold War, the SR-71 was extremely expensive to operate. Mostly decommissioned in the late 90's, NASA still flies a few for research purposes.
