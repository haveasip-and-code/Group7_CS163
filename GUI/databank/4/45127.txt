North Carolina
the best damn state in the nation! from the OBX to the great Blue Ridge it's all around sweet...for those of you who think that we're nothing but backwoods rednecks, you've got another thing comin' and had your head out your a$$ soon b/c you can come on down and we'll show you how it's done! ; home to the best basketball teams in the country ([UNC] baby!) and home to the best barbeque anywhere...eastern nc style... ; the women are sexy, the tobacco is plentiful, the countryside is beautiful, the beach is sick, the cities are sweet, and the colleges are even sweeter...
