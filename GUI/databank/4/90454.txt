System Wars
A forum on the gaming website Gamespot in which numerous factions of fanboys from Xbox(lemmings), Gamecube(Sheep), Playstation 2(Cows), and PC's(Hermits), fight over which is the better system. Many people find System Wars to be full of annoying idiots, but if you go in with the right attitude it can be quite fun.
