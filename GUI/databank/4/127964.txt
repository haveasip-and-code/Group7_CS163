Wilderness
In Runescape, the wilderness is the area where players can combat eachother in no holds barred fights in hopes of killing their opponent and take their stuff. This area is divided up into levels which dictates the maximum difference in combat levels one can attack and be attacked by. The farther north one goes the risker it gets.
