Ass snatch
A phrase made by a/to a Mexican meaning much like '[ass hole]', but it lacks the same intellectuallity. This phrase was developed when a 14 year old Mexican boy was hit with an object and yelled back at the person, out of anger and not thinking, which is cleary seen. Advice to all, do NOT use this phrase unless you plan on being flamed and/or wish to be stoned to death.
