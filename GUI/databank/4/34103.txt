Ralph Waldo Emerson
A Transcendentalist during the middle 1800s, who wrote essays like Nature and Self-Reliance, both garbage works of literature where he rambles on about nature and whatever other bullshit he can think of. Long winded sentences that have no meaning, yet we actually read this idiot. Emerson has actually been proven to be a flaming homosexual with his protege, [Henry David Thoreau], who lived in a fucking log cabin all his life, masterbating a lot.
