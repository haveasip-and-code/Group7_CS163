Last Days
A movie starring [Michael Pitt], [Brad Pitt]'s younger sibling. The movie is coming out mid-2005. The story tells the tale of Blake, a troubled rockstar, and it counts down to his last day on Earth, when he commits suicide. ; The movie is heavily influenced on [Kurt Cobain], from the music, to [Michael Pitt]'s looks. But some things have been changed. The movie looks awesome and I can't wait to see it, holy [shit].
