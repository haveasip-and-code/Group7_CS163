They usually stick to their Greebo, Grundgie, gothic freinds who they hsng round with in a big group, generaklly sitting on a feild in a big circle. Often they have thier CD player/MP3/ I-POD on full blast shouting out some heavy, guitar cladded music about people who are mad. These people are the ones who DON'T want to fit in with other Groups at school because they think Chavs, Townies, Trendies are gay.
