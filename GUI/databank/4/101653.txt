bye loop
What happens when, on the phone or instant messenger, someone needs to go (or fakes needing to go to end the conversation) and says 'bye' (or a variant, or an IM shortening of it like 'cya'). ; The other participent says 'bye'--or something-- The original person says 'bye'/whatever again, and the other one responds. This can go on for minutes or longer until someone--or their parent--puts their foot down.
