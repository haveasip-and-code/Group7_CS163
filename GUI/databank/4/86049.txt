teenage angst
A stage most freshman/sophomore girls in high school go through. Instead of taking the time to feel better about themselves, they elaborate their sad feelings by purchasing black clothes for an 'image', cutting themselves for attention, writing in their LiveJournals about why their lives suck, and say that their parents are out to get them. Some become so brain damaged that they run away from home and write really crappy poetry about how nobody has it worse than they do.
