Very popular Animutation flash video. Suprisingly, as opposed to most other Animutation videos, the lyrics are in English, but they're sung with a heavy Japanese accent, which makes them hard to understand. The subtitles say what the words sound like, which is often quite hillarious. The song is 'The Hot Limit' by Dance Dance Revolution.
