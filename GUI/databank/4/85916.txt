Universism
Universism is a religious philosophy which aims to unite freethinkers, whether they use the term Atheist, Agnostic, Deist, Transcendentalist, Pantheist, Scientific Materialist or other to describe their beliefs. Universism posits that religious philosophy should not be conceived in terms of one's views toward God, but rather the method and attitude with which one approaches religious questions. Universists embrace uncertainty and deem it fundamental to human progress.
