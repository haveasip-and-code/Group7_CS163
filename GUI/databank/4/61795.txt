Trinity Pawling
An Episcopalian boarding school near Pawling, New York. This school has a large number of international students and many of the students have rich parents. Despite the fact that the majority of the students seem to have been raised at least moderately well off, quite a large number of the students here endeavor to be 'street'. Like any school, they tend to get overexceited about their sports teams. ; Fiercely competetive with a number of schools, including Avon, Kent, and Taft.
