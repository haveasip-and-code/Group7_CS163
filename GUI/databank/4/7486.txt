Throwing a Frisbee
Throwing a Frisbee is a social ploy to leave two prospective mates alone. As in, if you and these two would be lovers are out with your friends, and the sparks start to fly, you might say 'Who's up for a game of Frisbee?' knowing those little happy pucks aren't going to jump in, thereby leaving them to make out wildly.
