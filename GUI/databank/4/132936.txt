Oingo Boingo
Excellent, quite original band with unique style, often compared to Devo. Fronted by Danny Elfman, who wrote the theme song for The Simpsons, has scored several movies (incredibly well) including nearly every Tim Burton film ever made. Acts as the singing voice for Jack Skellington in the classic Disney film 'Nightmare Before Christmas.' The other members of the band, while brilliant, are often ignored because of Elfman's overwhelming stage presence. Oingo Boingo's best songs can be found on 'The Oingo Boingo Anthology,' which features 'Little Girls,' 'Only a Lad,' 'On the Outside,' 'Wild Sex in the Working Class,' 'Not My Slave,' and several other interesting tunes. Oingo Boingo was formed in California and originally went by the name 'Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo,' which was later shortened. ; Elfman's vocal range is otherworldly, so Boingo's songs never get boring. Check this band out.
