Math Chem
Math Chem is an intense chemistry course littered with complex math equations and impossibly described concepts that are specially designed to fry the average sophomore's brain. This class is one of the worst on earth, and the experience of math chem is made shittier by the presence of a bitchy teacher who yells at the class if one person doesn't know an ultra-specific piece of majorly overlaoded content that comes from exactly line 50 in chapter 15, section 12 to the left of Figure 15-30. Not knowing that will lower your grade, make your entire class fail, and will lead to suffering in and out of class for all of eternity.
