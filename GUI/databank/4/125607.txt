pussiness
a 3rd grade level attempt at an insult, like when a person comes into any skank-ho purple room actually using their own screen name & confronts you about the FAKE name you've been using to troll other places.. Then they are displaying Pussiness. Even if your own trolling attempts were as pathetically transparent as if you were wearing a Belle around your neck.
