lorax
The greatest children's book ever written. It still sends shivers down my spine every time I finish it. It tells the story of how big buisness will destroy the world (in an environmental sense). The lorax himself is a character in the story. Describe him? That's hard. I don't know if I can. He is smallish, and oldish, and brownish, and mossy. He speaks with a voice that is sharpish and bossy. He is the protector of nature and is the foil to the Onceler's (the narrator) callous buisness attitude, which looks at things one dimensionally, with buisness his only concern. His buisness grows inversely with the quality of nature, which eventually drives out all the native species. Eventually his buisness, which relies on nature (which the Onceler doesn't realize) completely shuts down as his resources are eliminated. This bitter irony conveys how selfishness leads to nothing.
