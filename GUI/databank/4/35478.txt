boondocks
From the Tagalog (Filipino) word 'bundok' meaning mountain. 'Boondocks' became a part of American vocabulary during the American-Philippine War, during which mountainous terrain afforded the Filipinos a position of strategic advantage in fighting for their country's independence. The boondocks served as a Filipino base of resistance while earning a word in everyday American language synonomous with 'hinterlands.'
