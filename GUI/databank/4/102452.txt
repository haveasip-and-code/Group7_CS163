back orifice
A remote administration tool developed by the [cdc] which allows a user to control a computer across a tcpip connection. ; In simpler terms, it gives someone more control over a computer than the person sitting at the console, and the person at that box has next to no way of detecting Back Orifice once it's been installed on the computer. ; Back Orifice gives control of such things including, but not limited to: the file system, the computer's processes and registry, and any multimedia devices attached (webcams, etc.). A hacker would also be able to retrieve almost any information cached by the OS, including any passwords that are used by the computer's owner/operator. ; The only real cure for a computer infected with Back Orifice would be to reformat your hard drive, since BO can be configured to attach itself to just about everything.
