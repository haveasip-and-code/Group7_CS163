hairgirl
Hairgirl is a rare specimin of human(or so we think) that is classified by many things. First off, hairgirl's hair looks like it has been blowtorched, hairsprayed, and then put in a blender to achieve that 'my hair looks like shit' look. Second, hairgirl is usually seen in her natural habitat by the trashcan, or outside of the choir room, lurking around for her next victim. Lastly, hairgirl is also classified as writing wildly in her assignment book at lunch when she has completed her meal. Be warned, hairgirl is dangerous and unpredictable. We've even heard rumors that she may be a [ginger]. So be warned fellow hairgirl watchers, for she may be watching you. Note: We've heard conformation that hairgirl recieved a straightner for Christmas, and this may have changed her appearance. But you just keep on waiting for those days when she's too tired to straighten, and you will see her hair in ALL OF ITS GLORY!
