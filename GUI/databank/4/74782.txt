kiswenglish
it's a mixture of English and Kiswahili (principle language of Tanzania... think hakuna matata from the lion king). ; Most people in Tanzania speak both languages fluently and like Spanglish, when you're expressin yourself, you just flow with whichever word comes first. Even if you dont speak one of the languages very well, there are still words in kiswahili that express ideas better than in english, and vice versa too.
