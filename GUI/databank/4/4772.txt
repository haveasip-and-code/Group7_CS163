Los Angeles Angels Of Anahiem
Great job Artie, If Anahiem desired to keep the city name they had every opportunity to purchase the team themselves! Why didn't they? You have brought great family fun not to mention a classy organization to the Southern California area. Thank You for keeping baseball fun! Go Los Angeles Angels of Anahiem...
