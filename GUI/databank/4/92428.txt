Pulp Fiction
One of the greatest movies of all time. Gave [Samuel L Jackson] and [Bruce Willis] their starts and jump started [John Travolta]'s career (similiar to [Swordfish]). ; Pulp Fiction is probably the most (mis)quoted movie of all time, next to [Napolean Dynamyte]. However, Pulp Fiction is also just the greatest movie of all time and probably the most '[gangsta]' movie next to [Scarface].
