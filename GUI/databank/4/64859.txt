Physical Education
Class that the government forces on everybody so you don't get fat. It is basically a legal way for the school to abuse students by forcing them to do excercises, wear really crappy clothes and play sports and get hit in the head with the balls that the sports are played with. The gym teachers are usually overhyped bullies and just plain mean. ; Adaptive PE is the class that they put the disabled kids in wheelchairs (Some can't see or hear) and force them to play sports. If you are in the adaptive PE class and are not disabled in any way other then ADD or mild autism, you will get talked down on by both the teacher and the student helpers. In adapted PE, the teacher really hates you and wishes she or he could smack your face in but forces themselfs to act all nice and calm. ; Someone needs to ban PE for good for the health of students. There are more injuries in PE class then any other class in a school.
