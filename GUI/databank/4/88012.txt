heather mills
A [slutty], [ditzy], annoying woman who could never be anywhere as good and kind a person as Linda Eastman. Married a man 26 years her senior and had a child with him. Only did it for the money and social status and now says in interviews that she wishes they had never met. Unlike Linda, who was only despised by irrational, jealous [teenyboppers], Heather is hated all throughout the land by anyone (both men and women) with low tolerance for idiots.
