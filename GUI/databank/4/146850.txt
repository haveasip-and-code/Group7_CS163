WATERFALL COCK
The act of a 'lady' aggressively orgasming until the point of female ejaculation. If the ejaculation occurs while the penis is still inside the vagina, and the ejaculation can only be described as a 'waterfall' of liquid, then this equates to a WATERFALL COCK. ; For the antidote for such an occasion, see Pumice Cock
