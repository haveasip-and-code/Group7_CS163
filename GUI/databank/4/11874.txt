Scottish
1. Something or someone originating in Scotland. ; 2. The Doric, sometimes thought of as a dialect of English but this is incorrect. Germanic, has the same root as English. ; NB - This is sometimes taken to mean 'someone who drinks whiskey, eats haggis and regularly says 'och aye Jimmy''. This is highly offensive - I'm Scottish, I like haggis, hate whiskey and... well, the words 'och aye Jimmy' were invented for an English music hall!
