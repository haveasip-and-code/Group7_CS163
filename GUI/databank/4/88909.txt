Dracula
Adjective for something that is wicked cool, the pinnacle of being in charge, on a roll, or generally impressive. Carries a certain intrinsic Jazz Age or Beatnik vibe to it, but is easily suited to Extreme Sports, Hiphop, or Punk sub-cultures as well. Can be used as a noun as well, and in the noun form, should be capitalized.
