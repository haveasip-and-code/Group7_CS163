Let me get you a straw
'You're a [wuss]. Learn to deal.' ; An elaborated version of the sentiment is found in the phrasing: 'Let me get you a straw so you can [SUCK IT UP].' ; The proffering of a straw to aid 'sucking up' abilities is generally considered more comical (read: obnoxious) than simply telling a whiner to deal. ; Can be used in any situation.
