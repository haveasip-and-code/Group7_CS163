cessna
Verb. To 'Cessna'. ; Similar to Godwinning, to Cessna is to cite Stalin in a superfluous example during an internet flamewar, thusly automatically ending the argument in a loss on the individual who 'Cessnaed' ; This is derived from Cessna's law, which states that on any RPGnet flamewar (then expanded to the whole of the internets) the longer a flamewar occurs, the closer the probability of Stalin being invoked equals one, if Communist Administrators are involved in the discussion. ; Originated on RPGnet, then took the rest of the Internet by storm.
