Ginjivitis
A god in the presence of mortals. a DJ from RadioFreeZion (RFZ) with a randomly delicious blend of musical styles ranging from old school rap to hardcore industrial to punk and opera. he never holds back from telling us listeners that we suck if we request things like 'scotty doesn't know'. basically he is the man. balls to bones.
