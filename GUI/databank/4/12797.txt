circumflatulate
To waste time. A cute way of saying '[fart around].' Combination of 'circum-' meaning 'around' as in 'circumnavigate' and '[flatulate],' to [fart]. Usually good for a chuckle the first time someone hears it. Akin to [circumfornicate], but less harsh and easier to explain in polite company.
