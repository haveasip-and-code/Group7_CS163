KERL
-n- the group of girls in a particular school whom try to be something they are not...shows up places drunk and make fools of themselves in public. Extremely shady when together and if your name doesnt start with a k,e,r,or an l, you are obviously not cool enough to be associated with them...girls who put song titles in their infos such as Jack Johnson's 'Better Together' to describe their queer, possibly homosexual 'cult'. yes, cult.
