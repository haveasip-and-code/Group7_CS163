gentleman
(noun) (plural = gentlemen) A primitive form of man, more evolved than [Neanderthal] or [Cro-Magnon] but too naive to survive in modern times. ; Gentlemen were mostly wiped out by [feminism] in the 1980s and 1990s and replaced by modern man. The inherent weakness of gentlemen was their failure to recognise [women] as competition. They therefore wasted significant amounts of energy pandering to the female sex and were exploited at every opportunity by the latter.
