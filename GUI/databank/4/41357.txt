Alucard
[Alucard] ; 1.) A vampire in the service of Sir Integra Wingates Fairbrook Hellsing. He's from the anime Hellsing. You should buy it, it's good. He's the coolest anime character since . . . well, lets face it, most anime sent to america sucks. Its okay, I'm an anime fan, a female japanese cartoonist, and I know my stuff. ; 2.) That character from Castlevania, he was Dracula's son. The comic was okay . . . but there should only be one Alucard in the world! The anime one! The anime one! Dammit! ; 3.) Dracula spelled backwards. That's right, spell it backwards. Dumbass. ; 4.) The supposed reincarnation of Vlad Tepes (say-pesh)or Vlad The Impaler, also known as Dracula. The name Dracula translates to 'son of the devil'. ; 5.) A dude from INA studios. He's pretty cool. They do flash animations on Newgrounds.
