North Carolina State
Large public university in [Raleigh], [North Carolina]. Home to over 30,000 students, it's the largest university in the state. Noted for fantastic Engineering, Agricultural, and Design programs. ; Athletic excellence is stressed, as Wolfpack teams regularly defeat competitors in the ACC, most notably [UNC] and [Duke]. [Duke] sucks.
