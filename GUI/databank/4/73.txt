fierce tuna bowl
variant of [tuna bowl]. Fierce tuna bowls occur when you got one of those athletic chicks (the feminist type that don't shave or at least trim) and they decide to go do some physically demanding activity, like playing soccer or running a marathon. During the activity they drink lots of FIERCE GATORADE(TM) and sweat like fat guys at 10PM when the AYCE buffet is closing. Afterwards, they neglect to wash themselves or their undies, and in fact, leave them on.
