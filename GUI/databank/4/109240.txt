Unemployment
In the UK we have a saying. It goes like this. Whats green and gets you [fucked]? Your [Giro]! This sums up enemployment exquisitely - go down to the: job centre/ dole office / welfare - pick up your govermental contribution for food and rent, walk out of the building and directly into the nearest pub and spend every last penny of it on alcohol and drugs.
