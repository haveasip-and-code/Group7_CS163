minglong
The mother of [nipponsei] (although it is unclear if minglong is male, female, or other). Does 'all the real work' of the channel (file acquisition, marking, distribution, bot maintanance, and probably the dishes too). And of course, is under-appreciated. ; From all this, despite being the 'lowest raking' of all the ops, is thought to have more power than [GeneralSmoker] and [OsisNie] put together. ; Think about it... who is *really* in charge of your family...
