AR15
The AR-15 is the semiautomatic version of the M16 series of assault rifles, designed by the great designer Eugene Stoner, and it is most commonly used by the US armed forces. I would get into the history of this gun, but it is very longwinded but thoroughly interesting. AR-15s are usually chambered in 5.56 x 45mm (.223 Remington) caliber and have either 24', 20', 16', or 11.5' barrels and have either collapsible stocks or full stocks and may either have a NATO railed flattop or a carrt handle with an adjustable rear sight. This weapon has been the basis of numerous high-accuracy rifles.
