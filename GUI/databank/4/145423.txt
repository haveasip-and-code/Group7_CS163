New Metallica
Before [Metallica] hit their prime to [Loaded], [Reloaded] and [St. Anger]. They did some four demo recordings entitled [Kill 'em All], [Ride the Lightning], [Master of Puppets] and [...And Justice for All]. They also did the self entitled Metallica album, or more commonly referred to as the black album. With the release of this album, music critics could see that the band was destined to be so much greater and improved greatly from their days as a garage band. ; Most fans don't like the new Metallica because they're upset that their precious underground band has finally become good enough to be enjoyed by more people than just the people who pretended to like it so they can say they liked a band no one had heard of. New Metallica is more [Nu-Metal] than [Thrash Metal] and Nu-Metal usually has more of a [rap] influence than regular metal making it a huge improvement.
