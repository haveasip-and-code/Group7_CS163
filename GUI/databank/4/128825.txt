lancaster
Home of the amish and their corn bread. Also place where an assortment of college kids live together and touch eachother in vulgar ways. It is the temporary home of some preppy coke heads from connecticut, skanks from new jersey, japs from new york, wannabees from maryland, average jo's from p.a., and really confused people from the other 45 states. Lancaster has one bar, which smells like piss, and the entire town smells like cow shit. The owner of this 1 bar has 2 teeth. Actually, there is another bar called Brickyard. Its the only place to go where you can take your mind off of the fact that you are stuck in fuckville, pa.
