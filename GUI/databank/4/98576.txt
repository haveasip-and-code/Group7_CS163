Return to Castle Wolfenstein
Modern revisit to the classic dawn of id software, and a stark change from the originals of the series (like [Wolfenstein 3D]). True to the [FPS] format, RtCW takes B.J Blazkowicz back to Nazi Germany, working for the Office of Secret Actions, where he must escape his dungeon prison Castle Wolfenstein, uncover the secret projects of the SS (e.g. the Venom gun and the the Super Soldier project), and eventually return to the castle to defeat the Nazi's ultimate weapon: the reincarnated Heinrich.
