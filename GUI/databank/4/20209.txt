tattoo
A permanent drawing on the skin that shows that you are a conformist, a follower, a sheep, a person totally incapable of thinking for yourself, a mindless twit devoid of any originality, a twerp who wants to look just like every other tattooed clown in the world. ; A tattoo is totally UNCOOL. Just take a look at Grandpa's arm, where he got his tattoo in Honolulu in 1945.
