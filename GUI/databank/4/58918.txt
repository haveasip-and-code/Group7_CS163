Hucklebuck
Song by Chubby Checker in 1949. Has a great fast beat and a really cool, athletic dance to go with it!!! Whoopie Golberg demonstrated it best on her recent 2005 HBO special. Awesome! ; Just a fun word back when music and life was fun, and didn't have a damn thing to do with sex, which now everything seems to. I was dismayed to see that was what people overwhelmingly thought this word was about. Go to www.google.com and look up hucklebuck.
