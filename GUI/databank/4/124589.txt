mantis shrimp
actually not a true Shrimp, it is actually a type of Stomotopod that frequently comes with live rock. It eats basically anything and can cause havoc in reef systems. Peacock Mantis' are known to grow up to 6'' and some species have the striking power of a .22 pistol! They're by far the coolest live rock hitchhiker. If you have a Mantis Shrimp, it may make a sharp CRACKING noise which means its banging or striking against the glass or something in your tank; known to eat coral, fish and inverts.
