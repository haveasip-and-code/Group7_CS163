counterstrike
Originally a multiplayer mod for the 1999 game Half Life, it exploded with the dedication of mod makers and 'famous' hacking clans. Went from a semi-fun game and moderatly known to a huge topic of conversation game. These hackers claimed to be the shit because they could get (thats right, GET, these fags dont make their own shit) aimbots for a 6 year old game. ; Soon after this became a game for any looser who couldnt spell 'computer'. Every skateboarding douche came to this game and claimed to be a PC Gamer because they clicked a mouse and killed someone one time. ; In short, this is a game for posers. Used to be fun, but with the hackers and loosers, it just isnt worth playing.
