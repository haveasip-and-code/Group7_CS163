Jink
1) A term for the child of a Jewish-East Asian mating, based on 'Jew' and '[dink]' (where 'dink' refers to the racial epithet that was semi-popular for racist purposes circa the Vietnam era). However, whether this term is perceived as a racist insult, or merely a lively description, varies depending on context, intent, etc. ; 2) An exceptionally cheap, tightwad Asian. So termed for the disparaging association with stereotypical Jewish fiscal behavior, coupled with the previously mentioned 'dink'.
