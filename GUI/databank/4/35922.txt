my chemical romance
My Chemical Romance!Hmm?What is there to say except they fucking rock!!!!!I totally love'em!!!And to whoever said that we should listen to the ramones instead,well as a matter of fact I went to their concert wearing a ramones shirt.Well they totally rock,because besides being kick ass rock stars,I saw walking Gerard and Bob walking around before one of their concerts just chillin without bodyguards or any of that crap, and they werent stuck up to smile at me.(Even though I was to shy to go up to them,and i respected the fact that they wanted to keep their presence low key).Well any band that fuckin rocks,and loves their fans as much as they do is a god damn good band!!!I wish them all the luck with their careers and cant wait to go to their next concert!!!-Lizette
