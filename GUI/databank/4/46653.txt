strat
The best guitar in the world!! (Strat is short for Stratocaster)Invented by leo fender and was the first electric guitar made(with the fender telecaster which i personally think are gay). All the greatest guitar players started on or became famous on this guitar. Ones made in the 60s are really expensive and valuable.
