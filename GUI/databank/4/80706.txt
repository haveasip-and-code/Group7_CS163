Dooberet
inspired by Frech rapper, Jagoune. A flapping doorag with a luxurious beret made of the finest rabbit fur. Made with specialized strap attachments to snap the doorag flapper up like sausage rolls when the neck becomes over heated. Worn by french men. Will be the latest fad in north America in the upcoming year. Adds a touch of french flava to the urban thug look.
