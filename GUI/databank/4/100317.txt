Queen Helen
[Helen Clark], Prime Minister of New Zealand's gynocracy. Easily identifiable by her bad teeth, terrible haircut and most noticeably her incredibly low voice which makes her sound like a man. Can usually be seen around central Helengrad (Wellington, NZ) wearing a lime green or dark brown trouser suit and exercising control over her kingdom.
