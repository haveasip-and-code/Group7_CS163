vitamin water
A drink that teenagers carry around to look cool and act like they care about their health (like they didn't just eat a quarter pounder and fries from McDonalds). Sadly, what these poor kids don't know is that vitamin waters add water weight to your stomach=THEY GIVE YOU A FAT,SACK-LIKE BEER BELLY! (betcha didn't know that!) -Vitamin Waters are the reason so many teenage girls have those pudjy little love handles hanging out from the sides of their mid-drifts. yet still, teenagers gulp these down like they are a drink from the gods, when they taste like diluted kool-aid.But they make you look 'healthy' and 'cool' and that's all that matters!
