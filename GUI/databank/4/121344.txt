Gintama
1) A manga by Sorachi Hideaki, which takes place the a twisted past of Edo, Japan where aliens invade and cause a jump in technology by a sheer 3000-4000 years. ; Follows the story of Gintoki, Shinpachi, and Kagura (with obvious side stories). A rather whimsical adventure where irony is the plot. In a general opinion, it is a nice change from all the 'romantic' and 'over-actionious' pace every other manga seems to have taken. ; Also the author makes several various (and quite frankly hilarious) omakes. ; *Is currently being scanalated by the Yanime Group. ; 2) Translates out to 'Silver Soul' though can be mistaken for 'Silver Balls'.
