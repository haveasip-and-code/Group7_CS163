cawesome
A take on the oft used [chillaxin], cawesome takes the words cool and awesome to new, exiting levels they've never visited. The supercool can pronounce the starting (caw) as a crow(as in caaaaawwww. One would need to actually sound like a bird cawwing to do this), to emphizie cawesomeness.
