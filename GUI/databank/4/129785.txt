'Six celebrities play house in the Hollywood Hills.' ; VH1 sticks several has-been celebrities into a mansion that looks like it's designed by Andy Worhol and the guy from Queer Eye. The producers arrange activities and stuff, and on the episode before the season finale, Sally Jessy Raphael always comes and has a talk show about the past weeks in their living room.
