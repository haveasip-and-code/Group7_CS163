salsa
Salsa is not from Cuba as mentioned above. It is a term that refers to both different styles of dance and latin music. The term was created as a way of classifying a multitude of genres of music from latin america for an uninitiated American consuming public. What we now know as salsa music and dance originated in New York from a combination of various Latin rhythms (from Cuba and Puerto Rico in particular as well as others), as well as some U.S. genres like Jazz, primarily by Latinos (again Puerto Ricans and Cubas in particular) as well as other ethnic groups (i.e. African-Americans and Jews).
