holy inflatable shark  Batman!
Interjection, similar to [holy cow!] ; From the classic, campy [Batman: The Movie] starring [Adam West]. Robin ([Burt Ward]) had a habit of making strange exclamations ([Holy Polaris], [Holy Sardine], [Holy Captain Nemo]... you get the idea. ; At one point in the movie, Batman is attacked by--you guessed it--an inflatable shark, against which he must defend himself whilst the faithful Robin runs to get the [shark-repellent bat spray]. ; Should be exclaimed loudly and dramatically, for maximum campy effect.
