noumsayn
A newer version and much lazier form of the already useless and idiotic phrase... 'know what I'm saying.' ; This word in its original form was an entire sentence, but due to political correctness, the dumbing down of our society, and simple laziness in general, we now have a new word born right out of the urban lexicon. ; Below is the downward progression of how this word (noumsayn) was formed: ; 1. 'Do you understand what I'm talking about Mary?' ; 2. 'Do you understand , Mary?' ; 3. 'Do You understand?' ; 4. 'Know what I mean?' ; 5. 'Know what I'm saying?' ; 6. 'You know I mean'? ; 7. 'Noumsain?'
