Brighton
One of my favourite places in the entire world. If your coming to the south Coast of England dont even bother visiting anywhere else. Vibrant city, quality restaurants and pubs, great clubs, one of the few places I dont feel paranoid walking about, like I'm about to get my head smashed in by some huge arrogant Lairy Stella drinking lad, as they all steer clear believing it to be 'full of fuckin queers innit'. ; The reality is, whilst there is a high proportion of gays, (who incidently I have noticed never cause trouble, never brawl, never shout in the street and never litter) the place is actually crawling with local student beauties from the 3 major universities, and ladies from all round the country who come to escape the narrow-minded overtly hetrosexual, cultureless, burberry ridden, chav infested laddish shit holes like neighbouring [portsmouth], [bognor regis], [southampton] and (further away) [Essex] and shop at the millions of different boutiques and shops, very many of which are set up by the resident gay community. ; The only criticism is that the average cost of going out in the city of Brighton now rivals the cost of a night out in London. Although one night out in Brighton will make all future nights in London seem like a bit of a stitch up.
