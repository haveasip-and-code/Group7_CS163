Wake Forest University
Definitely the best school in North Carolina, the Deacons consistently have one of the best basketball teams in the country, and unlike their eastern ACC rivals, actually enjoy their time in college (see [Duke University]). Few campuses in the country can compete with the southern beauty of Wake's tree covered greens or the attractive student body (you have to send in a picture in order to get in).
