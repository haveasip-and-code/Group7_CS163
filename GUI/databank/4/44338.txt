Guantanamo Bay
A place where suspected terrorists are held. It in no way is anything close to a Gulag or Concentration Camp. Until recently, these so-called educated liberal anti-american scumbags couldn't tell you what a gulag was. In the Russian Gulags, prisoners were locked up and forced to do hard labor for 16+ hours per day, starved (many to death), cramped in shacks and forced to take a shit in a bucket. In Nazi concentration camps, jews, gypsies, homosexuals and other innocent people were forced to do hard labor, starved, gassed, shot and burned to death. Prisoners in Gitmo are given the Koran (in its traditional manner as outlined by a military guideline, you anti-american liberal scumbags!), good food, signs everwhere that point to the direction east (muslims pray to the east). Gitmo is a gulag? what has this country come to?
