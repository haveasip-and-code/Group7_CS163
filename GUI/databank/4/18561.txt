Vertical Tuck
The vertical tuck is employed when a male, in possession of a boner, reorganizes his junk such that it is 'tucked' up under his waistband in a vertical manner (sometimes causing the boner to stick out of the male's pants). The vertical tuck ensures that boners are undetected by onlookers. It is especially useful when, while possessing a boner, the male needs to perform non-sexual tasks, like doing a math problem at the blackboard.
