Pink Floyd Fan
Someone who listens to and enjoys all the music of [Pink Floyd]. To sharpen the definition, since many people don't seem to understand the sensibilites therein, I will underscore what does NOT make a [Pink Floyd] fan. ; 1. Anyone who thinks 'Another Brick In The Wall Part 2' is their best song. ; 2. Anyone who thinks they didn't make any albums after '[The Wall]'. ; 3. Anyone who does not know who [Syd Barrett] is. ; 4. Anyone who thinks [Pink Floyd] is a person. ; 5. Anyone who can't name the members. ; 6. And most importantly, anyone who can only name '[Dark Side Of The Moon]', '[Wish You Were Here]', and '[The Wall]' as albums they have written. ; Let me go on to elaborate that anyone who likes just popular music can't consider themselves a fan of a band.
