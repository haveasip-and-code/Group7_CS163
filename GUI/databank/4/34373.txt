Escondido
A small town in Southern California, half ghetto half not, containing bro hoes and bros alike, and where fun consists of hanging out at the local Star Mart and stealing alcohol. Parking lots are always a great place to be. The people are assholes and a majority end up staying in this town, also known as 'Esco', that they love to hate for the rest of their lives.
