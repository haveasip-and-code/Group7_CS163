ISSB
International Security Special Branch There are members of the ISSB working in almost every country in the western world and there may well be a few of their number working in the east. International Terrorist Groups have worked very closely together for many years. The leaders of the western world are not stupid. The security forces in Europe, particularly in Ireland (North and South) are the best in the world. Many of the Northern Irish ISSB are seconded to security forces throughout the world to help fast track development and training programmes.
