see  wut had happened was..
when a ghetto person -or person that talks ghetto- gets ready to tell a story; usually about how much weed they smoked that day, how much crunk juice they drank that weekend, what ho/dude they banged, when they're about to lie, or when they are talking about something that totally doesn't need to be started with 'see wut had happened was..'
