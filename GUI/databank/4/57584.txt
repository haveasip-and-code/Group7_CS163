taftie
A current student or graduate of the Taft School in Watertown, CT. A member of the long line of the biggest and the best preps, a Taftie hates Hotchkiss, loves frisbee golf, hockey players, and sweet lax, and fondly remembers smoking in the vents, drinking in their closet, skipping Morning Meeting to eat breakfast at the Jig, and going to the scene.
