drood
A character in the Everquest MMORPG's. This is not a definable character type but rather one who exhibit's certain traits. For example: being a moron, having spell's that other characters would find useful but charging exhorbitantly for, inability to speak in English - can only speak l33tspeak, cannot spell, shits pizza and red bull, doesn't know how to play the game, think's he's l33t (strangely, only male's aspire to being a drood) and probably has a face like a meeting of the worlds worst acne. ; In other words, the annoying prick in the game that spoils the enjoyment of others.
