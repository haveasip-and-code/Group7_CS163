7th heaven
Old show that is still in rotation on TV. It's a show that is created by Aaron Spelling, who thought it would be a good idea to make a show that tells people what kind of lifestyle to live: A very sheltered one. The father is a minister who has a drunk sister who attacked his kids. How, he could be a father and disown that bitch and not let her in the house, but he had to do the 'christian' thing and forgive her. Of course, the kid whom she attacked forgave her as well, when anyone with common sense knows that in reality, the kid would be traumatized for living by being vicoiusly attacked by his own aunt. ; A product of Aaron Spelling's decaying brain.
