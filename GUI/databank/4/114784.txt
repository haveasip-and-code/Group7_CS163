shitkittens
(interjection) An expression of irritation or anger that exploits the ironic juxtaposition of the scatalogical expletive 'shit' with the harmless fluffy imagery of kittens. Also alludes to the colloquialism that one is so nervous/upset that one could birth kittens, or shit something unusual.
