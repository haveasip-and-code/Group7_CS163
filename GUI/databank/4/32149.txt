Heavy Metal
Can you sing about something else besides Satan? ; Can you sing at all? ; Can you not be such goth fucktards? ; Can you focus more on music and maybe write some non-retarded lyrics and maybe get someone who can actually sing to sing them? ; Can you make it a little more normal and a little less like goth vampire shit? ; Can you make it a little more closer to rock & roll? ; Can you go five seconds without mentioning Satan? ; ^And why the fuck do you do that anyways in the first place? ; Do you even know the difference between something that sounds like shit and noise and mud vs. something that actually sounds good?
