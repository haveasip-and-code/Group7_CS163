Kiddicted
A person who has become obsessed with the rocker Kid Rock. These people sit on the computer all day long talking to other people with this same disease. There is alot of variety in the members, old and young, rich and poor. They also travel together to see every show they can. It is so bad at times, that they will risk getting fired from jobs just to talk to other members on the net all day. The families of these members think they're nuts.
