boy band
A group of 'musicians' who rarely play their own instruments, consisting purely of reasonably attractive males who appeal to girls ages 10-14. This term does not apply to all bands that are comprised solely of males. It is used in reference to a specific genre of music artists who perform for a pre-teen audience in a mainstream pop/rock style.
