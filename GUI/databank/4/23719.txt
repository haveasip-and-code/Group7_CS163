mukk
Word to say to have your boyfriend kiss you. When you say it, it looks like a kiss. Technique follows: ; Lean in really close looking sexy, look deep into his eyes, and smiling playfully, softly say 'Mukk.' ; If you laugh it'll ruin the effect, but it's fun even then... practice practice practice!!! And it's so adorable when your b/f tries mukk on you! :D
