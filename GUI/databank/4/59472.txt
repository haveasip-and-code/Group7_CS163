Erasure
English pop duo, popular back in the late 80's and early ninties. Wrote great songs, with Vince Clark's innovative use of synthesised sounds and samples creating a varied and exciting back drop for the singer Andy Bell, who is an amazing vocalist. The songs are all classics, but unfortunatly, that meant we had to put up with those tossers wheatus covering 'A little respect' and absolutley butchering it.
