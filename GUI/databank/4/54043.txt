ahuick
Orginally a catchphrase used by Disney in the 'Goofy' cartoons. Whenever Goofy would do something stupid or ambiguously silly, he would say, 'ahuick.' Nowadays, it is used to potray someone who has done something completly moranic. Also an expression for stoners to recognize themselves as [baked].
