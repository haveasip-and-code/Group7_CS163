rebuckled
The state of total bucklement as a result of a combination of alcohol in conjunction with weed. However the RE in rebuckled refers to a previous session of bucklement. Where as now you are buckled, but for the second or prehaps third time thus decreasing your resistence to drugs and alcohol resulting in extreme buckeling.
