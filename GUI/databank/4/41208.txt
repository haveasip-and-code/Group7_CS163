PStool
A person who is blindly, fanatically loyal to [Sony]. Will immediately buy anything with the [Playstation] logo and mindlessly insult anyone who doesn't share their fanaticism, and would proclaim a blank disc with '[Final Fantasy]' or '[Madden]' on the face on it to be the greatest game ever made. PStools rival (and possibly exceed) even [Nintendrone]s in their numbers. ; See also: [pathetic], [fanboy], [moron]
