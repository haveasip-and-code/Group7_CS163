salvation army
A christian organization founded by General William Booth is the mid 1800's. They are actually aa denomination, known as 'salvationists'. They are spread accross the world, offering various public services including disaster relief, shelters for children, women, and the homeless. They also offer drug and alcohol rehab among various other services. They spread their religion in this process. I guess i just wanted to point out that it isn't just a thriftstore. You ignorant fucks.
