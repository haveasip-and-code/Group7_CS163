powerpets
An online virtual pet site created by Liz and Tony (staff names - Sweetfire and TheMetal). It's geared towards all ages and is 100% free of advertisements. There is a [24/7] live staff monitored environment and Powerpets is [COPPA] compliant. All of the staff members are regularily found on the message boards communicating with members and participating in chats. Many of the adults playing the game are parents who were brought to the site by their children or found the website on their own and encouraged their children to join. It is a family atmosphere where people are encouraged, not discouraged. ; The main focus of Powerpets is educating and caring for animals in an environment that is free of hostility and is safe for everyone. Scamming and hacking is taken very seriously and members who break major rules are removed from the site. ; Members can choose to adopt a wide variety of pets, all of which are found in the real world. Education comes in the form of quests where short books are read in order to answer questions about animals. ; For those who like to get involved, Powerpets offers a chance to submit your own stories to be published as an official PP book, create greeting cards or submit items that may be released for sale in one of the many shops. As a bonus, you receive commissions for book sales or a lump sum payment in powerbucks for any artwork used. ; Powerpets also allows you to choose your own goals for the game. Most people follow some of the mainstream goals like achieving elite status, gathering the stones, purchasing land, creating a gallery or being in the Bureau of Statistics. Other people simply enjoy playing the games or chatting on the boards and making friends.
