Egging
Egging is fun prank that the youth of today enjoy alot. It is the art of throwing eggs, usally at cars, houses and sometimes people. Its really annoying, stinks and is a bitch to clean off. But its fun to do, to watch people shout at you and looks great when the egg explodes all of a surface, even better if its a person! When you throw loads of eggs at one thing it is called slaugtering. It is usally done on halloween.
