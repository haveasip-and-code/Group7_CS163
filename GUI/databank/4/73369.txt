Moody Blues
A British pyschedelic/progressive rock band from the '60s that is often overlooked for other bands such as Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Genesis, and Electric Light Orchestra. Their signature sound was due to Mike Pinder with his Mellotron and Ray Thomas with his flute. The Moody Blues was the first rock band to feature a flute as a main instrument, not Jethro Tull, and the first rock band to record an album with an orchestra.
