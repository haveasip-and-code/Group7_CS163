gay agenda
Homophobic version of the WMD scare the neo-conservative government conceived to gain support in the invasion of Iraq. ; Where the WMD scare was aimed to inspire fear in the masses of an attack from Iraq so they'd support Bush's invasion, the Gay Agenda inspires fear in the masses of the future of their childrens' sexuality to gain support in banning gay marriages from the country.
