El Dorado High School
Clearly everyone in El Dorado High school is automatically construed as an idiot. There are no idiots in other schools, just at El Dorado. Oh wait, that's inherent bullshit and it appears someone was talking out of their ass. There are idiots at every school (Yes, there are even idiots at Esperanza, you biased shit-cock), so stop bitching about El Dorado being a school that harbors morons. Shit, why do I even care about this drivel?
