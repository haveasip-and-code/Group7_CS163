Nehi
An amazing soda that has not been heard of since the early 90's. To describe the taste, basically, it was different flavored cream soda. The blue flavor was the best. The name 'Nehi' is rumored to come from the bottles being so tall, that if they were placed on the ground next to someone, the top would reach their knee.
