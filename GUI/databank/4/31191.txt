hardcore scene
wrong again! all the hXc kids in ohio knows it's only those emo pussies with their track jackets an hair over one eye dude! im hXc and sXc and ive been to some pretty sick local shows, from newark to columbus to hebron, heath, zanesville, even one in dayton. they have bands like kill whitney dead, a waking nightmare, above this fire, waking kills the dream, dead to fall etc. shows and at only one show did anyone that had the balls to get in a pit have hair over one eye and he admitted to being emo!! youve got the first half right, most hXc's have gauged ears and tight(usu. girl pants, if not dickies or tan cargo shorts.)pants, but most wear a tight as fuck hardcore band t-shirt and a zip-up hoodie. most ive met wear skate shoes like DC, or vans or chucks some wear older shoes tho.
