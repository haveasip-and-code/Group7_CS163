Bastila Shan
Bastila Shan was a Jedi knight in 4000 BBY. She was the youngest to ever master the art of [Battle Meditation]. She was a member of the Jedi strike team that captured Sith Lord Revan during his reign over the [Sith]. She fell to the dark side and became apprentice to the Dark Lord Malak. She betrayed [Malak] by joining [Revan] in his quest for revenge. She became[Revan]'s apprentice, and was handed the Sith throne temporarily while her master went to complete some mysterious task in the outer rim. She could not control the [Sith] or the [Star Forge], and the [Sith} Empire fell into civil war. Bastila went missing on Korriban after the fall of the Sith, and, just like her master, has still not returned.
