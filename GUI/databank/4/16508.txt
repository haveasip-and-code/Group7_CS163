Donald Duck
Disney's best and funniest cartoon character, with one of the most famous voices in animation. ; Not a 'bad guy' but quick-tempered and grouchy. Often can't resist doing something a little mean-spirited--for which he always pays. ; It's his mishandling of situations that makes him funny. He's not 'perfect' like good guy cartoons, but is deeply flawed. And after things blow up in his face his temper is hilarious, mostly because of his grouchy 'quack-quack' voice.
