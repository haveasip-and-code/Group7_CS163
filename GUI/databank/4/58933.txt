clean room
The filthiest room at the [depot]. The tableau is littered with dirty q tips, cartoons and drool from Lalondez dodos. The clean room is where the [guy] go to play trivial pursuit with Mr Gauthier. To make sure that Dum Dum cants see them fucking dats dog, fbannaty and Lalondez put up some dunnage to cover the window. Dum Dum blew up and tolls Turner so he says you [cantsaydat] and we has to take it down.
