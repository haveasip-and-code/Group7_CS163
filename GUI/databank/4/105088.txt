Fuckin' A
an exclamation in praise of the actions of another, or as an expression of surprise and disdain, akin to 'What the hell?' ; also, the first letter of the 'Ghetto Alphabet,' which everyone learns in inner-city kindergartens. In ; urban settings profanity is used so profusely and gratuitously that children are taught the alphabet by repeating: 'Fuckin' A, fuckin' B, fuckin' C...' ; It may have been a joke in a comedian's act, circa 1983. An Eddie Murphy routine?
