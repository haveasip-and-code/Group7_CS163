stereotyping
The single most pointless use of [Urban Dictionary]. ; **most stereotypes are true in some cases. some are mostly true, some not at all ; there is also no point bitching about stereotypes, because in the end they are pretty harmless. ; it just gets annoying as hell when people define something just in defense, but then go define something else with some obvious stereotype
