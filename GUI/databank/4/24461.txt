Drapek
She was supposed to learn AutoCAD so she could teach it this year, but she never did. Now she sits at her desk the whole perod not helping anyone, just marking assigments from her other classes. Richard and Mike do ALL the work. She pays no attention the whole period and then has the gall to get up at the end and say 'Man, these kids are driving me crazy!'
