Marxism
A socio-political economic theory developed from the various writings of Karl Marx and Friederich Engels. Often misrepresented by ignorent and spoilt middle-class kids who have no concept of what it is to live within the disprivaleged working-class that has no hope of escaping their position. ; Its *nothing* like the Proletarian Bonapartism (Stalinism) that has existed. Communism has *never* existed - stop comparing apples to oranges and read the bloody Manifesto you thick, rich, bastards.
