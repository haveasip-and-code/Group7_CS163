Nuremberg defense
To use the fact you were only following orders to escape prosecution. Used by [Nazi] Germany's military officers in [Nuremberg] when they were on trial for their treatment of the Jews, when they claimed to have nothing to do with it, only doing what they were told to do. ; It is seen elsewhere in history... one example would be Oliver North's trial after the [Watergate] scandal, in which he claimed their illegal activity was just them following orders.
