jeff buckley
The greatest singer/songwriter of all time. Tragically died before his time but he has a cult following that grows evey year. Songs such as 'Lover, You Should Have Come Over' have been massacred by Jamie Cullum and other wannabes. Jeff's lyrics have touched the heart of everyone who hears them and hiis guitar tone is awesome too.
