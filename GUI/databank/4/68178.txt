Mesa
The trashiest city in all of Arizona; a congregation point for bums and druggies alike. Comparable to Compton, CA, with a Mexican flare. Cigar shops and porn shops are plentiful, with a sufficient number of weird bus people milling about in the streets. Entrance to the city is noted by a pungent smell of stale ass. Street corners and the front of 7-11s are a substitute for employment agencies in Mesa, the city with the highest per capita amount of payday loan stores in the universe. Most popular jobs: auto thief, landscaper, house painter, drug dealer/cop. ; A charming city, really.
