MLG
An organization in the United States for professional gamers. Is an acronym for 'Major League Gaming.' Many great gamers have been professionally signed by MLG. As of now, they mainly focus on Halo 2 tournaments. They also post 'official' gametypes for Halo, Halo 2, and other games, so the gametype is fair and perfect. For example, an MLG game for Halo 2 Team Slayer would be battle rifle spawn, human weapons on map (no sword for fairness), etc. Many believe MLG is a lame gametype, though others practice it often in hopes of getting good at it. By the way, if you'd like to be funny, next time someone wants to play MLG over [Halo 2] over XBL, ask them, 'What's MLG? Does it stand for My Little Gun?'
