Mythic Entertainment
A company aligned with the forces of darkness and evil. They have created a once highly enjoyable video game, Dark Age of Camelot, only to destroy it by future expansions driven by greed. These expansions are released only to destroy the very core of the game at the expense of the emotions and psyche of the people who pay them money. The main reason of these expansions is to get people to pay $39.95 for the latest overpowered items and classes in the game. This is highly unneccessary on Mythic's part, as they could charge a 39.95 yearly in addition to their monthly fee and people would pay that gladly to play a kickass game. The people who are directly responsible for the creation of these expansions will likely burn in the fiery depths of Hell for their sins against its devout playerbase.
