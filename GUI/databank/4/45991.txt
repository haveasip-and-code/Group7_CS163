Guess What's In My Pants
A game played on the 'Opie and Anthony' radio show in which female callers are asked to rub their phone against their most intimate of areas in a variety of motions(up and down, side to side,circular motion) and then guess the particular hair style the woman is sporting. Styles include wood floor or john bennet, the landing strip, the hitler mustache, the earth momma muff, and the 5 o clock shadow.
