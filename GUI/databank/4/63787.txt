perverted-justice.com
Controversial website featuring chatlogs, photos, and personal information of adult men who have tried to sexually solicit what they thought were underage children in chatrooms. In fact, the 'children' in question are the website's adult volunteers, who then publically post all of the man's information as a warning to parents and a deterrent to other would-be pedophiles. The work of 'PeeJ', as its followers call it, has resulted in many arrests and convictions, much press coverage, and even the recovery of an abducted and sexually abused young girl.
