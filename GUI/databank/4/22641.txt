Kut U up
Kut-U-Up is an [Indie punk] band that formed in the late 90's. The band is made up of [Chris Cote] on Bass, [Brendan Raasch] on Drums and [Brandon Parkhurst] and [Micah Mattson] on Guitar. They all sing, but mainly just Chris and Brandon. They went on the [Pop Disaster Tour] with [Green Day, Blink 182 and Jimmy Eat World]. They are mainly what the movie [Riding in Vans With Boys] was about. In 2002 they let out their First, and so far their only cd, 'Pulled Over...your Eyes are Telling Me Different Son..' The best songs are 'Sailed to Far' and 'Have's, Have Nots'. Brandon and Micah are also in the band [Yovee]. And yes, in the movie, [Billie Joe Armstrong] branded Chris' Botton with a pool stick.
