blissey
A bitchy egg that gets easily owned by everything but noobs like to clause it. Some idiots use it but still like to clause it for some reason. It's one of the evil creatures that form the awful [skarmbliss] combo. Get totally raped by half of the things on the current metagame because it totally sucks.
