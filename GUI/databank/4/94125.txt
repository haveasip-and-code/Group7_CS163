Drunkenese
The prevailing language of Alchoholopia and its prevailing Drunken Commonwealths. Considered by many as one of the easiest to learn and most universally popular of the languages, Drunkenese is still not considered a viable language credit in most accredited instututions of higher learning. ; If you are unsure whether or not a speaker of an unfamiliar language is in actuality speaking Drunkanese, look for these tell-tale signs: Excessive salivating, repeated catch phrase quoting, propensity to trail off or tell stories that never really go anywhere, horizontalness, spontaneous projectile vomiting, and a tendency to overestimate audience's level of interest in speaker. ; Speakers of Drunkenese are occasionally confused with having a degenerative brain disorder. ; If you are interested in learning more about Drunkenese, check out a bottle of Royal Crown from your local liquor store and study, all night if you have to.
