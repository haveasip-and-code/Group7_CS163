wembley
The small wet stain on your underwear (and, in desperate cases, your trousers) caused by putting your dick back after taking a piss without shaking properly. Named after the English national football stadium (presumably due to the shape of the stadium). Not something that impresses the ladies: be warned, splashes from the sink when washing hands can give the same effect. Um... but you should still wash your hands, of course. Particularly evil on light coloured trousers.
