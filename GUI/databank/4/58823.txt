Rental Car Customer
First definition: One who's reservation is not held. ; Second definition: Hopeless victim, who, after driving a creaky, smoke-filled vehicle with dome lights out and mysterious engine clanks, cannot contact anyone at the rental car office but an uneducated twit who couldn't make it as a used car salesman.
