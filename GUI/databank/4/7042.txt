virii
Virii defines a category of software that is comprised of viruses, worms and trojans. The general usage of the word is to describe a collection of software. ; Virii itself is a plural word as there is no need for a singluar form because the more descriptive singular form of {virus, worm, or trojan} could be used. ; Virii is not the plural form of virus (which is viruses). Virii has nothing to do with biological viruses.
