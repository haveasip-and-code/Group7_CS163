The Getaway
[GTA]-style game set in London. Different to the arcade-esque gameplay of GTA in that The Getaway aims to look like a film, or real-life situtation. The graphics look very realistic and there is almost nothing on screen during game-play. Unlike competitors (GTA, Driver, True Crime) The Getaway uses officially licensed cars throughout the streets of London. ; The cooler aspect of this game is the fact that London has been flawlessly recreated on the PS2, enabling some people to drive to their house in the game (check out realgetawaytour.com). The game is very violent and contains a lot of swearing.
