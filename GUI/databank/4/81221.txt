germantown friends school
An increasingly preppy, but historically liberal friends school. Don't step foot on campus if you are republican. Be prepaired to call the teachers by their first names, sit in an empty room for 50 minutes a week, get to school early so you can park you new car in one of 5 student parking spots and work your ass off so that you can go to a good university.
