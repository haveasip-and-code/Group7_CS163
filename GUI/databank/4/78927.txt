Soup Sandwich
A kid that lives across from me that has complete and utter disregard for personal hygiene, constantly smells of decomposing skin and bacteria, eats ogre style, leaving his hands drenched in ranch dressing, never cleans his laundry and wears filthy clothing. This individual does not have the ability to interact well with others due to his slow slurred speech, and wandering eyes. This individual is balding, and the hair he does have, resembles animal fur. He is truly 'lost in the sauce'
