telenor
Telenor is the Norwegian Telecom Corporation. They own all the phone-wires in Norway, and because of this, they try to steal as much money as possible from people as they can. Telenor doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that the monopoly of phone-services has disappeared a long time ago. Victims of Telenor are mostly the Internet-users, who has to pay way too much for low-bandwidth connections. They try to confuse their customers by telling everyone that they are very cheap.
