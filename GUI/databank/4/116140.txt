urban dictionary user
Someone who posts definitions on this site. There are two types of UD Users that I've noticed: ; 1) The user who tries very hard to post an unbiased opinion and not to take sides. ; 2) The user who is a complete and total douche and only posts insulting, vulgar, and downright rude definitions. These are also the users who flame like there's no tomorrow, band together to try to remove definitions that they don't agree with, and tend to have small dicks. In short, the users that are ruining this site.
