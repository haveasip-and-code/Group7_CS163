One is all  All is One
I term with great meaning. AS confusing as it seems, it makes sense. The World is the All, and you are the One. Worlds existence, and ability to move forward is dependent on this law. With death, comes life, and with life comes death. Thr world is big, but little things like people and animals are what keeps it going. If you die, the world continues on, you will decompose, and become nutrients for plants, and herbivores eat those plants, and carnivores eat the herbivores, they die, and life starts over. The world always moves forward, a constant cycle. Life needs death...and death needs life.
