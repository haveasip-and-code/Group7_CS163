you're fired
Sorry Donald. People have been using this phrase way before you even dreamed of having a show. It was fist used to fire someone from a job. This usage has dropped of though because saying 'You're Fired' might spark emotion. Instead now HR people use the words [terminated] or [released] to let someone know they were 'Let Go'. ; My friends have been using it forever when someone screws up and they are pissed.
