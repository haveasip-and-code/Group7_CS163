Maine
as a kid from maine, I'll say I kinda like it. Sure I love moxie, but so should you. Portland is a sweet city. It has more resturants/bars/pubs/club-ish things then you would ever be able to visit in a lifetime. Also, the ocean is wicked (yes I know) awesome. For instance you can go sailing around and chill beaches. ; If you can't be pro-active enough to find stuff, or hate the outdoors, its not for you. Just let me know if maine has ever caused a problem to anyone else. Seriously, do you have a blueberry alergy or something?
