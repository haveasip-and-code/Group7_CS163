West Warwick
Commonly known as Wack Warwick, or W Squared. Small town in central Rhode Island with an inner city appearance. Overrun by crackheads, wanksters, wiggers, and most of all--haters. Being a resident in the town of West Warwick means you are exposed to the most haters in a small area you will ever see. More often than not, these haters are also people that think that they are better, or as good as everyone else. Which again more often than not is not true considering they are douchebags. Another defining characteristic of the West Warwickian Hating Douchebag is their amazing ability to try to make everyone feel bad for them, by making their personal problems public. Extremely ugly and vandalized, the town itself is also about as attractive as what you find in the toilet the night after Mexican food for lunch. Don't ever go there, ever.
