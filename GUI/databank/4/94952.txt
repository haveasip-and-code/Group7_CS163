Mountain Brook
Mountain Brook is an extremley wealthy town in Alabama. It is FULL of money. Drug use is reasonably common only because no one knows what else to do with all of daddy's money. When we turn 16 our dad will by us a beamer or a h2 or something no less than 40,000$. We are ALWAYS called 'Brookies' by all the other surrounding schools. The only place our moms will lets us shop is at Saks. About a year ago a person living in homewood(a nearby town) wrote a book called 'The Tiny Kingdom'. It is about Mountain Brook and the little things that we do that seem to be so funny to other people. The thing is every word of that book is true. Clothing is pretty much the same year round, For guys its kahki's and a raplh lauren or lacoste, and for girls its pretty much the same thing except they wear seven jeans. If you are a girl at Mountain Brook High School and you do not own a pair of seven jeans, then you are looked down upon. Also if you are not a member of atleast one of the two country clubs here in mountain brook, you will be looked down upon. The only sports mentioned here are golf and tennis, except for football, we live in the south football is huge! So basicly if your daddy loves you, then so will everyone else! ; IF YOU ARENT RICH...YOU WONT SURVIVE!!!!
