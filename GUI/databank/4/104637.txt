stingray
A '63-'76 Chevrolet Corvette. Also known as a 'midyear.' The midyear 'Vettes were based on the Mako Shark dream car (released in '61), which shared many of its lines with Bill Mitchell's Stingray race car. The '67 Vettes, especially the ones with 427 mills and 'stinger' hoods, are considered by many to be the finest combination of looks and performance ever produced by Detroit.
