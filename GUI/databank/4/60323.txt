Lynxism
Closly linked to [nebism], it sprung up on the BCU forums after Forum user Lynxifer became angry over excessive use of said Nebisms. He devised a set of words to help outline the idiocy of the words. These sayings have become imortalised, and you are guranteed to see at least one Lynxism in any conversation you have with him
