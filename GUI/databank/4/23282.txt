Double Cola
A southern soda brand made in Chattanooga, TN. The name was given by doubling a 6-ounce bottle into a 12-ounce bottle. It was trying to compete against Royal Crown Cola(a.k.a. RC Cola), Coca-Cola, and Pepsi Cola. They also made another drink in the late 50's called [Ski], which they named it after an employee's thing they did on their honeymoon: skiing. ; Today, these two sodas are still in retail stores, go pick a dozen-pack and enjoy them.
