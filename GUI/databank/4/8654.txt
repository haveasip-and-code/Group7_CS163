trenchcoat mafia
The Trenchcoat Mafia was just a gropu of friends who started wearing trenchcoats as a result of one of the member's mothers buying one for him. The other members followed it because they liked the look. They were dubbed the Trenchcoat Mafia because someone had insulted them with the term and instead of seeing it as an insult they embraced it. It was also the group that Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris were associated with. Contrary to popular belief they were NOT members. They happened to be friends with on of the members, Chris Morris. The Trenchcoat Mafia was used as a scapegoat in the wake of the Columbine shootings. And even though Klebold and Harris wore trenchcoats on the day of their attack, they did not wear them regularly.
