Ben Harper
Musician who has many different genres; folk, blues, rock, funk and now gospel. Technically, he's extremely talented. He has a nice sounding voice and his guitar playing is really something. As a songwriter, ehh, he's okay. Certainly no [Bob Dylan], but who is, really? He could be some of the best things to happen in music the last 10 years.
