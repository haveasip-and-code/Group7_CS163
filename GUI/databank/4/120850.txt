Willie Nelson
one of the greatest country singers of our generation. had an unsuccessful start in nashville in the 1960s, writing hits such as 'crazy' and 'hello walls', but was rejected because music row thought he sang 'funny'. well he basically said screw you and in 1975 went back home to Texas and recorded one the best albums of all time- Red Headed Stranger- with his 9 piece band. This launched his career and he has been considered an outlaw and legend ever since.
