L-Mail
L-Mail, or Lmail is short for 'letter mail', and is a method of sending a real physical letter via an Internet web page. ; An L-Mail system typically enables individuals and companies to send mail internationally directly from their computers, requiring only Internet access and a browser. In a first step, the user defines the letter format and then composes the text. Subsequently, the data is transmitted via a network to a printing centre chosen by the user, preferably in the vicinity of the addressee, where the letter is printed, put in an envelope and fed into the postal system. ; Because letters are posted locally to the recipient, a faster speed of delivery can be achieved than by traditional air mail. With local postage being paid, costs can also be less than an equivalent air mail letter.
