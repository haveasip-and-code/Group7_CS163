Piconjo
Piconjo, as seen in other definitions, is a widely known user and animator in the [Newgrounds] sub-community. His fame is the sort that is matched by only a few. ; He is well-known for his [Flash] animations skewering other famous [Newgrounds] artists, most notable and frequently-targetted of which would be [Legendary Frog], the creator of many [Flash] films that parody popular [video] [games]. ; While much of Piconjo's work is actually animated fairly decently, and is undoubtedly funny, the sheer bitter viciousness of the harsh insults within can be difficult for some to watch. As a result, he's gained a large following of people who both love and absolutely [loathe] his work. ; His motivations for continually tearing down other well-known [Flash] [artists] is something of a mystery, and in spite of what other people (Or definitions, for that matter!) say, nobody REALLY knows. ; One popular theory that is oft-repeated, but with little actual accuracy, is that Piconjo once partnered with [Legendary Frog] on [Frog]'s most famous submission to [Newgrounds]: his [Final Fantasy] tribute. As the story goes, as the die-hard fans of the mysterious Piconjo CLAIM, Piconjo did most of the work on this particular submission, but [Frog] took all the credit. ; Absolutely no evidence, nor seemingly any reason, was present for this claim to even be made, but as with so many things in life, a sensational [accusation] is generally enough to get 2/3 of people halfway believing it. ; Problems with this theory include: ; 1) [Legendary Frog] has made many other [Flash] animations since the [Final Fantasy] tribute, and a few before, too. The tribute was merely what made him famous. All of his movies are animated very similarly, practically identical in style. If the [Final Fantasy] Chocobo remix was truly done at the hands of someone else, only to be betrayed by [Frog] afterwards, [Frog] certainly learned to duplicate that exact style extremely quickly in a fast cover-up, mere weeks later. ; 2) Piconjo's seemingly second highest priority (behind the downfall of [Frog]) is humor. Indeed, one of his most famous qualities is his penchant for baiting, misdirection, and out-and-out lies, all for the sole purpose of humorous effect...usually when the victim finds out he's been had. It certainly would not be beyond Piconjo to gleefully start such rumors, and sit back to enjoy the chaos that ensued as his fans spread it around, wide-eyed and believing. Indeed, he'd be hard-pressed to stop laughing long enough to submit his next movie. ; 3) Piconjo himself has never out-and-out said this, nor made any claim to his relationship with [Legendary Frog], other than that he 'bites' his 'p3n0r.' His hatred of [Legendary Frog] seems to be powerful, indeed, but it is a spotlight shared by many other artists, [Knox] of clay-animated fame among them. It could just as easily be an all-out bitterness towards other artists that he feels do not deserve the recognition that they have. ; 4) [Legendary Frog] was becoming hated among a few other [Flash] artists already when Piconjo originally surfaced, namely because they felt that he, and his work, didn't deserve a fraction of the celebration that they were receiving...not to mention that [Frog]'s ego was also reportedly growing. Rumors (yes, more rumors) began to surface that he had used malicious scripts to automate [Newgrounds]' built-in user ranking system, to artifically boost his [Final Fantasy] animation into the limelight. Again, no evidence (or reason) seemed to be responsible for this bitter accusation to spring up...but again, that didn't really matter much when it came to people wanting to believe it. It is often widely-speculated that Piconjo is merely one of these other famous artists in disguise, which wouldn't allow for the 'betrayed by Frog' scenario. ; 5) As stated before, Piconjo's driving motivation is sheer, tasteless (but undeniably funny), humor. It is entirely possible that Piconjo bears no actual malice to [Legendary Frog], or any other ego-inflated [artists] he decides to pick on. Piconjo's notorious personality is the sort that would take one look at the tremendous fan-base these famous [artists] generate, however, and gleefully decide to mess with their heads. ; Indeed, his submissions, in spite of the undeniably high caliber of many of them, generate some of the most hateful, withering responses on [Newgrounds], all from the shocked fans of the [artists] that he's skillfully tearing apart. Piconjo feeds off these reactions, thrives on them, is DRIVEN by them. ; In other words, it's a possibility that the mystery-man does it all simply because he thinks it's FUNNY. ; We may never know the truth, but one thing is for certain: Piconjo may be big, as big as those he seeks to tear down, perhaps made big BECAUSE of those he chose to attack, but nobody knows WHY he does what he does. ; We can only take guilty pleasure in his viciousness, even while we enjoy the work of those he hurls insult after insult at, and speculate. There is almost as much fun in that as there is to be had in any [Flash] art...be it an original by a well-known trying to be serious, or Piconjo's inevitable urination on it.
