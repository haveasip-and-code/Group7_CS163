Floyd Rose
The inventor of the locking floating tremolo. Floyd Rose tremolos are designed to keep the guitar in tune while using the tremolo which other tremolos couldn't do before. They work because of a locking nut which tightens the string down so movement of the tuning peg doesn't affect it and from being locked at the bridge which allows no movement of the strings. Since they're floating tremolos, they can bend backwards and increase the pitch.
