Cockeysville
As the only possible example to a mix between rich and poor, urban and roral, cockeysville is the very epitamy of peacefull war... where private school meets public... where where loyalty to a crappy school is the only thing that interferes with friendship. Cockeysville is what many confused people call home... and there is no wonder to that. America may be the mixing pot of the world... but cockeysville is the mixing pot of America.
