shojo
A 'pop' subculture within Japan that was mainly viewed as adolescent, 'cute' and female based on pure consumption as a result of a common exposure to consumer products. Emerged as a result of the rapid economic change in Japan that led to the rise of the middle class, and therefore allowed 'adolescence' to exist. Shojo people were sometimes viewed as sexual objects, but were not sexually experienced themselves.
