Renaissance Fryday
A day set aside to be nice to a friend who is feeling down, observed on the third Friday in October. ; Etymology: derived from 'Renaissance,' a program in which students with good grades receive gifts from local merchants; + (French) 'fry,' because the event which inspired Renaissance Fryday took place at a McDonalds that gave free French fries to students in this program; + 'day.' 'Fry' and 'day' were combined into one word to resemble the word 'Friday,' since said event occurred on a Friday (10/15/1993).
