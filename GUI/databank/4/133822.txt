Master of Puppets
Master of Puppets is Metallica's third album. It was released in 1986, which is the same year that bassist Cliff Burton died in a tragic bus accident on September 27th. Master of Puppets includes Battery, Master of Puppets, The Thing That Should Not Be, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Disposable Heroes, Leper Messiah, Orion, and Damage Inc. It is arguiably one of Metallica's best albums.
