republicans
Members of one of America's two largest political parties which, like it or not, are equals in opression as well as service. It has recently become trendy to hate them, because Green Day tells us to. It is better to be a republican than a [tool] whose information is force-fed to him through the hose of MTV's *infinite* wisdom.
