gaithersburg
a suburb of washington, dc. located inbetween rockville, darnestown, olney and germantown, right in the middle of montgomery county, the 3rd most affluent county in the US. voted 17th best place to live in the entire united states by money magazine and cnn online in 2005. notorious for being 'ghetto' and de-SPIC-able, it's actually very weathly. the median household income is over $80,000 (more than twice the national average and more than both germantown and olney). less urban than rockville, older than germantown and less rich than bethesda, it's not that bad if you don't live in/near montgomery village or directly off of 355(where you will either be pulled over, arrested, and/or shot). BTW ZIP CODE 20878 + 20850 YOU LIVE IN GAITHERSBURG NOT NORTH POTOMAC. four high schools in the city: gaithersburg, watkins mill, marguder and quince orchard. gaithersburg is ghetto and basically an immigration officer's wet dream, some very wealthy people that live about an hour away in laytonsville also attend (retarded boundry lines), watkins mill is full of semi-wealthy yet trashy white people (especially around neelsville) and really ghetto black people, quince orchard's full of rich white and even richer minorities who SWEAR they live in north potomac and darnestown, when really they live in gaithersburg and rockville. finally magruder is full of gays in plays, and really hardcore druggies and crack whores (thankfully most of them live in rockville too) but is actually the most normal of all nearby schools in terms of academics and athletics.
