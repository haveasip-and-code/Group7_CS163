Velvet Revolver
Yeah okay great. I hate Velvet Revolver. They will never, ever, ever amount to anything Guns N' Roses have ever done. Ever. The Velvets apparently 'Want to bring some danger and grime back in rock n' roll'. It has already been done, and by... you guessed it, Guns N' Roses. I hate Scott Weiland, and Slash is not even trying anymore. Have you noticed how fucking similar the riff to 'Fall to Pieces' is to 'Sweet Child O' Mine'?
