ridgefield
A bunch of rich, white idiots who think they're the kings and queens of the world. All the high schoolers think they're going to Harvard or Yale, and all the parents are stupid and naive. The schools are overrated, there are no services, and it seems like Ridgefield is a bubble. This town just flat out stinks. Everyone's white. The kids are asses, and everyone hates each other. god its bad.
