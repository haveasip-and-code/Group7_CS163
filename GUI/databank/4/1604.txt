Wal-Mart
A very, very depressing place to be. ; There are many terrible things about Wal-Mart, and I'm, just going to say a few. ; A: They censor their CD's. It's incredibly annoying. ; B: It's quite easy to smell several different kinds of smoke on most of their employees. (I was declined a comment when I asked about that.) ; C: The occurrence of collisions between shopping carts and Mini-Vans has been increasing steadily in the Midwest. You would think that they might at least shorten the pot-breaks for the cart people a little bit. ; D: The employees seem to blame you for everything, for example...: ; 'My daughter got an abortion because of YOU!' ; 'I bet Bush won the election because of YOU!' ; 'I got pregnant because of YOU!' ; E. A crapload of the male employees have hit on my 53-year-old mother. I find that rather disturbing. ; Wal-Mart = The ultimate Ghetto-Mart. ; See also: [hell]
