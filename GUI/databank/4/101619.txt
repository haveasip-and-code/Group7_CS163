Uhh  Steve
Coined by Brian 'The Dark Lord' Chamberlain, AKA The DLC. ; Originally it was used by the Dark Lord to complain about a ruling by the DM that caused him to say, not do nearly as much damage as he expected to in D&D. ; Now it is more of a word generally used to question anything that seems illogical, out of place, ironic, or hypocritical.
