forever friends
Someone who is there for you no matter what. Who knows anything and everything about you and still likes you. Someone who will sleep with the phone under their pillow just in case you need to call them at 3 in the morning. Someone you can laugh uncontrolably with or cry histaricly with. They will obsess over guys with you and. Someone you can act like a complete retard infront of and know it will make them laugh. But most importantly someone who is there for you when you need them most and will love you through the good times and the bad.
