depravative logic
an arcane paradigm of logic in which the user derives a generalization that one action will directly/automatically result in future dangerous/extreme behavior as if it were a widely accepted foregone conclusion. ; Arguments based on use of depravative logic tend to be presented as though they are based on deductive reasoning (the conclusion is guaranteed).
