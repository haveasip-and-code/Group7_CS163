splosh
Covering one's self in food/wet and messy substances in order to acheive sexual stimulation/arousal. ; As seen in an HBO episode of Real Sex #24 the issue of Sploshing was explained. The fact that the Brittish had tight upper lips did not mean that so were their genitals. The thought of tasty desires has come today to be published in a magazine, 'Splosh'! When people think of food, they automatically think of sex. Nothing is more arousing then an appitite for lust?
