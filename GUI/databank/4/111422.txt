fleek
Sure, men may never experience the pain of child birth, but women will never fully appreciate the agony of a fleek. A fleek is a light flick to the testicles. The pain doesn't come at first so the target is usually happy and thinks 'Ha, they missed'. However, the throbbing soon starts to seep in like a cold fog rolling in at the dead of night. As the bewildering feeling spreads from the groin area, the target wants to vomit as if they were hit in the stomach with a sledge hammer. The term 'fleek' was popularized during the great fleek wars from 1990 to 2000. Some say the fleek wars are still on...so guard those balls.
