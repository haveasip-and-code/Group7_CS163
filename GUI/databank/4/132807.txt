clinger
A clinger is any [foreign object] (usually splattered [feces]) that is attached to the inner wall of the [toilet]. ; It's an unspoken fact that most [males] using the [bathroom] will aim their [urine] stream at any such clingers in an attempt to remove them, just to do their part of keeping the [crib] clean.
