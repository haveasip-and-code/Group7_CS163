crunk in your junk
Though containing the word [crunk], having crunk in your junk has little to do with being crazily drunk. 'Crunk' is here utilized to describe any and all random debris that has found its way into the pubic hair after a hot and sweaty day; such as lint, crabs, and even the straying [dingleberry]. Can usually be remedied with a shower.
