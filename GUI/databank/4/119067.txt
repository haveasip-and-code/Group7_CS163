A 'music' channel that has suddenly turned to pop culture and shows that nobody could give a crap about. All they do anymore is interview D-LIST celebrities like Kathy Lee Griffin and magazine editors about where Jay-Z gets his haircut and why Harry and the Hendersons was the greatest movie of all time. This channel is pathetic!
