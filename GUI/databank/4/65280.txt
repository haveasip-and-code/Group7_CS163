mfst
the badass mutha fuckin swim team of [St Mary's] College. our rookies aren't afraid of a little marker on their faces. we pump iron to shitty new age. then we get belligerent and smoke us some candy cigs for our nic fix, when we've had enough of the spiderman g bong. monty's our favorite building, and we enjoy a refreshing power hour in the afternoon. that's right, robopound was our creation. we also fry tots after monks with our bare hands. then eat them. one word. buhhhkeenee. we like to talk shit. and flip the bird. natty bo is the drink of choice, especially on case day. so shoot that beer, son--and don't boot--cuz you're part of the MFST.
