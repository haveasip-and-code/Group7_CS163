jason giambi
A Baseball Player who played his best years in Oakland on steroids. In 2004 when he was on the Yankees, he testified that he took many steroids, admitting that he was a steroid taking asshole, unlike [mark mcgwire] and [barry bonds] who 'didn't know' he was taking steroids. Giambi is slowly regaining baseball skills, but he will never be as good as he was while on the juice.
