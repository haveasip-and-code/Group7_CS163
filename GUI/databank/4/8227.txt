A [troll], as seen on the [pokemon] boards at [Gamefaqs], who gives crappy advice to people who ask for advice on movesets, like the following: ; 1: suggesting physical attack moves on [pokemon] whose attack stats suck and special attack moves on [pokemon] whose special attack sucks. ; 2. recommending horrible moves. ; 3: posting false information as fact. He cleverly gives well-written posts with bad advice to unsuspecting people who are not aware that he is a [troll]. ; 4: Ignores the advice from true [pokemon] fans who are veterans and experienced with [pokemon]. No matter how many times he is told otherwise, he will not listen to others when they point out the truth. ; 5. Thinks Gardevoir, a very feminine-looking [pokemon], looks awful as a female. ; In other words, if you see this person, DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM. He will ruin your team's movesets!
