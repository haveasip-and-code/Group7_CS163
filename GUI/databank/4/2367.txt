Crestwood High
A school located in northwestern Sydney. Is ruled over by pure evil. Enjoyed an era of greatness during 2004 but with the Year 12s that will be there in 2005 it will probably slip down to the level of Model Farms or Northmead. Was once a favourite target for vandals including the famous time an English room was torched during 2002. Since then a great big fence was built around it, causing the place to look even more like a prison. Home to groups of people such as the Ethnics (a group of Asian and Middle Eastern people who only appeared inside rarely and spent a lot of the time in the carpark) and the Kingdom (a group of revolutionaries who aimed to overthrow the dictatorship and establish a communist state).
