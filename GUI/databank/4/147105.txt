Scene Bopping
Scene bopping is the emo/scene kid way of [hardcore dancing]. It requires no skill or ability. It is basically poor hardcore dancing. There is no rythme in the motion, it is always done during incorrect or unappropriate parts of songs, and looks very sloppy. The kids who do this are called [Scenie Boppers].
