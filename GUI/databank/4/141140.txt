Hard man
Hard man ('Ard man), more scientifically known as tracksuits retardus, is a general tough guy who roams around looking for trouble cos he is just so hard. The 5 rules of being an 'ard man are - ; 1) You MUST not have a school bag ; 2) You MUST ALWAYS spit ; 3) You MUST ALWAYS swear ; 4) You MUST have a fundamental inability to walk without rolling your arms in suspicious patterns to look 'ard ; 5) You MUST have a rock 'ard shaved head. ; Extra bonuses to being an 'ard man can include - ; - Wearing a baseball cap at 90 degrees (Fake burberry if possible) ; - Having a compulsive disorder to hating people who express individuality ; - End your sentences with 'So I was like fuckin...' (Don't say anything else after the ...) ; - Hating any form of black clothes ; - Eating nails as part of a nutritious breakfast ; - Listenin to DIZTRUXHUN, UPRISING, HELTA SKELTA or any of the like. ; - Having a nickname such as 'Gaz', 'Baz', 'Jubba', 'Staples' etc, etc. ; - Wearing cheap jewellry, such as large fake diamond earrings, more better known as [pling] ; - Driving a nova ; - Frequently dropping words into your sentences such as 'Buzzin', 'Banging', 'Geeza', 'Innit', 'Sorted', 'Raspin'' and 'Waaaaaa' ; - Address non 'ard men with terms such as 'Dick 'ed' ; 'Ard men are usually found grazing their natural habitats. Don't be mistaken, these guys are ROCK ARD. They may look harmless, but seriously, there is no one cooler, or should I say 'MORE BUZZIN' than these guys. ; Don't be fooled, the stench of stale smoke, the cheap and excessively used jewellry, the baseball cap at a 90 degree angle are all SERIOUSLY COOL TRAITS OF AN ARD MAN. ; If you see an 'ard man, DO NOT APPROACH HIM, COS BELIEVE ME, HE IS ARD so you 'best get runnin', really.
