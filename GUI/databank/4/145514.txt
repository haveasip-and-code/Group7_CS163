celebros
In J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, the river Celebros was a river of Beleriand, a tributary to Taeglin that flowed past Brethil forest. ; The Celebros descended southwards from the highlands of Brethil into the Ravines of Teiglin through a series of waterfalls that filled the air with fine spray (the name Celebros means 'silver spray'). A wooden bridge crossed the Celebros at a place called - because of the waterfalls' spray - Dimrost, or the Rainy Stair.
