lipidiofrunchintitis
(n) The condition in which an abnormally large amount of scrotum skin is present in the male. This tends to increase the verticle sagging distance of the testicles. This does not necessarily mean the testicles are huge, but no cases have been clinically found of those consider smaller. (p>0.50)
