howard county
Howard County is one the most wealthy counties in Maryland and one of the top in the nation. Known as 'Hoco,' the majority of people that make up the county are lax players, including the #1 ranked team in the nation for the past 6 years from Mt.Hebron. Other recognitions include: Ellicott City and Columbia which were both ranked in the top 25 places to live in the US, along with the county being nominated as 'Sportstown USA' by Sports illustrated in 2004, and ranked as one of the top counties in public schools in the nation. Most residents are upper-middle class yuppies, however you do find your 'ghetto' areas. But then again, compared to some other places, our ghetto looks pretty good. There's definitely a lot of diversity too, especially with the 'asian invasion.' Most parents in the county both work, but the stay at home moms are the soccer moms that show up to their kids games wearing designer clothes and ready to scream until they lose their voices. The top schools in sports are Riverhill, Mt. Hebron, Centennial and Glenelg, but with two new schools built in the past 3 years, redistricting might change those dynasties. Although the kids are all jaded by the Columbia Mall, the Howard County Fair, and whatever else there is to do there, you're guaranteed to get drunk or high any weekend you want.
