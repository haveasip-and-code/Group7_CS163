copy and paste
waaaa wawawa waaaa waa wawa awa awwa awawa wa wa waaaa do you get that? Now pronounce every single syllable of it. Go back and sound it out. Do you understand? waaaa wawawa waaaa waa wawa awa awwa awawa wa wa waaaa . . .. wow! I just retyped that whole thing. Every single letter once and once again, (you can double check) without using copy and paste. So I think we should all give a great thanks to the guy who made 'Copy and Paste'; copy and paste being the 'copying' and 'pasting' of text eliminating redundancy.
