iPod
A portable MP3 player made by Apple.What stupid people call all MP3 players.A complete piece of shite. Original versions had a battery that was impossible to remove without reworking the PCB. The damn thing is the worst example of the Marlboro Lights culture in that it comes in minimalist stylings. Do yourselves a favour and get something made by Creative instead.
