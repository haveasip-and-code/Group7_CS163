(It was later rebuilt in honor of Hoff, as can be seen from space today) ; Hoffanomics is, in every way, the description and ways of David Hasselhoff. The act of bringing down the Wall could be considering Hoffanomics. Making a show such as Baywatch quite possibley the world's most uniting TV show in history could also well be considering Hoffanomics at work. ; While 'Reganomics' is largely considered to be the cause of the decline of communism in the USSR, most modern historians have come to the conclusion that in fact Hoffanomics was the main driving force behind the collapse of the Soviet Union. ; Word created in Dec 2005 in the year of our Lord.
