eyeball
A warden of Irish decent. This being is only capable of carrying out one mundane task at a time, such as pressing door entry buttons, chain smoking strange branded cigarettes, or answering the telephone. ; Eyeball is easily identified by his flaking skin, bedraggled appearance, and strange odour of TCP. Special abilities include the making of super strength tea, and talking loudly during good television programmes.
