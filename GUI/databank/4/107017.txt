xebian
Xebian is the name of a race of large green furred quadrupedal aliens who inhabit the primary world of Envien. They are a race bred for war by the nefarious Neyikians. The Xebian race branched out into eight different corrolary races each one with specific traits and abilities. They escaped from their Neyikian Captors and founded their own homeworld on Envien. The Xebians are known for their space faring technology based around the Hypono-Jump Drive and highly advanced shielding technology.
