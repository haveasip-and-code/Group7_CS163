AAA
1.) Triple A batteries. They are one size smaller than AA batteries, and usually go into TI calculators, remote controls, etc ; 2.) an automobile insurance company. American Automobile Association ; 3.) Some guy in video arcades that you can never beat. Usually too cool to put their initials and put 'AAA' in haste.
