Carew Tower
Actually, the closest inspiration for the Empire State Building was the Rand Building in Buffalo, both of which were designed by the architectural firm Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. The Carew Tower was designed by Walter W. Ahlschlager. Plus, the Empire State Building is also brown; it is clad in the same Indiana limestone that the Carew Tower is.
