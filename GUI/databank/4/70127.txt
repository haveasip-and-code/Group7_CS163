celldweller
Band formed by Klayton (aka Klay Scott). In the self titled debut album he recorded all the instruments and male vocals. He later assembled a full band for touring. Thier sound is best described as 'all over the map' (in a good way!) Their style goes from metal to techno to electronic to acoustic and almost, but not quite to country. Their album has sold quite well despite being an indie band. The album can be found on celldweller.com or on iTunes, but some music stores now carry it. Definately worth searching for.
