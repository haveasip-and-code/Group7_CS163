Agent
Sentient programs within the Matrix, the law enforcers for the Machine organization. They all resemble tall white males in suits and sunglasses. They can move in and out of any hardware directly connected to the Matrix, which means that anyone who's mind has not been liberated is potentially an Agent. They have amazing abilities not limited to super strength, speed, accuracy, and masterful skill of all martial arts. Only one human has ever been able to defeat any Agents who attempt to oppose him: the One, Neo. Now that he is deceased, Zion operatives can do only one thing when they see Agents: run.
