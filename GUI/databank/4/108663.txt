Lunched
Past-tense of the word [lunch]. See that definition for a good idea of what lunched is. It means to do something stupid, or to mess something up. It originated from the stoner-culture, and used to be associated with being high or [burnt]. But that is not always the case anymore. Go read the definition for [lunch] if you still don't understand. ; You also hear, 'lunched out'. Same thing, just a different way to say it. ; Definitely regional, I've only heard the word used in DC when I lived there, and we said it ALL the time! Since moving from there, no one I've met has ever heard of it.
