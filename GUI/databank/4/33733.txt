paul mccartney
Played bass in the most publified Beatles and did not play with his back turned and did play it upside down when playing a right handed bass. Becuz in those days the Beatles were poor and could only afford what they could. So McCartney used a right handed bass sometimes. Stu Sutcliffe is the former bass player of the Beatles and he played with his back to the audience cuz he sucked and didn't want to get embarrassed.
