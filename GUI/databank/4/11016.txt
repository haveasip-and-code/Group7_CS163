Nintendo DS
A gameboy advance with a gimicky pen and paper gameplay add-on. Seriously the Nintendo DS isn't even a step from the gameboy advance. It just doesn't constitute as next generation techonology when it was released months ago. A microphone and a second screen doesn't do all that much for gameplay as most games don't use the functions. I'm not biased in the portable war and PSP has a lot of flaws also. But the DS just doesn't release good games often or much at all. Wario Ware, Kirby and Meteos are the only actual solid titles- everthing else is just average or sucks. The DS isn't very portable- it's freaking huge and fat.
