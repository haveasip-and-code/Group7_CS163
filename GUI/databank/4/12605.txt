huperoffspring
An ultra-politically correct term said to be used by feminists as a replacement for 'human.' See, 'human' ends in 'man,' which should be replaced with 'person.' But even 'huperson' ends with 'son,' so for ultimate equality it shall be changed to 'offspring.' Therefore, we have the absolutely sterile word 'huperoffspring.'
