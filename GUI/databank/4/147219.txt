Dumple
Latin- reffering to a pertruding lump in the pants. Sometimes often known as a semi. Tucking a hard on side-ways or just behind the elastic of one's underwear. Easily reffered to as a Dick lump ridding the ICK and adding the UMP, but who cannot forget the D. Often seen highly in the early 90's of the nearly extinct biker shorts.
