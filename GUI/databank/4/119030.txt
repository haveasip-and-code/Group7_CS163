the simple power rule
A mathematical rule useful for finding the derivative or instantaneous rate of change of a function that involves the form y = x^n. If n = 0, then the rate of change is zero, since any number x raised to the zero power is 1. To find the derivative when n is some other number other than 0, simply pull down the exponent n, multiply the entire function by n, then subtract 1 from the exponent after you pull n down and multiply. Basically: ; 1) y = x^n ; 2) y' = nx^n-1 (y' means take the derivative of the function with respect to x, so use the simple power rule!) ; Piece of cake! One of the most helpful rules in calculus, because if you didn't have the simple power rule, then you would have to use the general form for a derivative, which takes alot longer than the method above.
