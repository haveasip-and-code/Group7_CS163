acupat
The US army's new digital camoflage pattern. ; After seeing the effectiveness of Canada's [CADPAT] and the USMC [MARPAT], the US army developed it's own digital pattern, which utilizes shades of grey. Although designed to be an all-purpose camoflage, it is obviously greared more towards arid and urban enviroments, as the colour scheme is near useless in a woodland setting. ; Like [CF] [CADPAT] uniforms, ACUPAT uses velcro to attack name tapes and other patches.
