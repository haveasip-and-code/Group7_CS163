Berkeley Heights
Like [SHORT HILLS] [Westport] and [Darien] Berkeley Heights is on of the wealthiest towns in the US. We drive around in either a BMW Mercedes or a Lexus, which our parents bought for us. We don't pay for college bc we get full rides on either academics or sports bc we are that damn good. Our parents own banks, hotels or restraunts, or all three. Everywhere you look there is a gas station or a pizza parlor. The only black people in this town are the ones that work here. Berkeley Heights is also known as Berkeley Whites!
