teenick
Nickelodeon's pathetic attempt to appeal to the Teenage audience. However, with such disney-esque shows as 'Zoey 101', 'Ned's Declassified', 'Romeo!', among others, no teenager with a freaking brain would want to tolerate that crap. ; They try to make it appealing with MTV-style introductions, and with 'celebrity' guests who play stupid games, however, these attempts only drive away potential viewers.
