gender-rape
'The use of one's gender as a weapon or as an escape against another.' ; Generally, gender-rape implies some sort of allegation of sexual impropriety or sexual prejudice on the part of the accused, when in fact the accused is generally innocent. Therefore, gender-rape is a means of sexual prejudice, more frequently used by females against males, but not always so. Akin to reverse-sexual-discrimination but on a more passive-aggressive level, usually with ulterior motive. ; Used as early as the mid 1980's by Robert W. Schellhaas, Phd MDiv
