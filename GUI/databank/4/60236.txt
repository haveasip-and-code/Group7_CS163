Asia
1. Continent which is: ; a.Earth`s biggest continent ; b.Place with the most ranged economy. For example the Phillipines is 3rd world, but Japan is one of the best economies in the world. ; c.Continent whose citizens would completely die out without rice. It is not just a stereotype, all Asian countries(except maybe some in the Middle East) depend on rice and even food that is not rice is often made of rice somehow. ; d.Continent whose citizens can come to the US and do better than white, black, or latino people in any bussiness (other than entertainment). ; e.Very poorly defined on Urban Dictionary by inom. Asia is not a counrty, it is a continent. And it has far less poverty and starvation than some other parts of the world. ; 2. Crappy 80s band. MTV and VH1 like to call them 'hair metal'. I call them 'pop'. Kind of like Bon Jovi, but ; not even worth playing at a dance. ; 3. Rare Italian girl`s name.
