Spunko
An imaginary character in the Ducko comics. He wears a spiderman mask and carries a backpack of random things (ninja stars, lighters, airsoft gun, lotion, 2 AA battery, swiss knife, etc). Does stupid things. Usually sways Ducko to do stupid stuff as well... ; Spunko wants to destroy everything. He is not stupid... he has common sense. ; He doesn't really care about others, just himself... after all, he's just an imaginary character.
