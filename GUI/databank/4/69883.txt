plato's closet
A store that sells high priced fashion for cheap prices. They have everything from Old Navy to Abercrombie and Fitch. And if you need quick drug or gas money you can bring them your nice expensive clothes and they'll buy them from you for cheap and sell them to people like me for 4 or 5 more dollars than they just bought it from you.
