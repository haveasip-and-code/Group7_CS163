Jailbait
A sub-genre of Japanese Pop/R&B music featuring stuttering 90's-influenced Timbaland-style beats and whiney, high-pitched underage girls singing about things they are too young to know about, possibly dressing Lolita-esque, and/or having provocative English song titles that may or may not have anything to do with the song content.
