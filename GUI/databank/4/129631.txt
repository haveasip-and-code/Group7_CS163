Ben Moody
Former guitarist and creative axis of 15-minutes pseudo-goth act [Evanescence] (remember them?), who left almost as soon as they started selling records by the shedload for the usual 'creative reasons' and because he felt unhappy at selling shedloads of records. So he now writes for both [Avril Lavigne] and [Kelly Clarkson] - so must feel creativly fulfilled and a lot happier.
