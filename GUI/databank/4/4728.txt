Morecambe
Morecambe,England is basically the crappiest town in England and believe me,England is full of them....(apart from maybe Lancaster...) its near Lancaster (doubling my MISERY) and basically its full of bed and breakfasts that the government use to house scoungers.Theres no components of a regular sea side town,and everything it had going for it closed down [yonks] ago.
