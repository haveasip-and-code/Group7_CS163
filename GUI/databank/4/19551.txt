An individual who, in the beginning, saw the universe in all of its splendor, absorbed the knowledge and wisdom into his infinitely powerful being, and acheived a state of ultimate undestanding. He then proceeded to pick up a guitar and play. With his first notes he created the Earth and sky. With his first dyads he created fire and light. And with a mighty A7 chord, he created Man. These acts were followed by joining the Yardbirds, followed by the greatest classic rock band of all time-Led Zeppelin.
