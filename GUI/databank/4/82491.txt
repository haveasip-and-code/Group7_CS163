warhammer
warhammer was oringinally designed in the late 1970s when nerds unanimously desided that computer games, Dungeouns and dragons and a complete lack of respect for clenleaness wherent enough to stop them getting girlfriends. This gave grown, acne filled, drooling men everywhere yet another reason to stay in there mothers basement and not see the light of day for week... Phew and there was me thinking I might move out.
