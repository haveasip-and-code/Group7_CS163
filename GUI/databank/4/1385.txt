V8
A kick-ass powerfull engine. Ricers usually tend to flap about how in-effiecient V8's (of the 70's) were. Actually, they were in-efficient only because the lack of technology, now, with new modern muscle cars coming out, such as the Charger and the Mustang, these cars actually compete with Honda's little 4-bangers for MPG. V8's have 8 cylinders arranged in a V pattern, these produce monster amounts of torque and HP, killing rice like no tommorow. New Mustang's have twice the cylinders and about three times the displacement as the Honda Civic, yet still gets 30 MPG highway. Take that, rice burner.
