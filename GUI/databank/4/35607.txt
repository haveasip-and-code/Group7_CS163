FADIDDLE
My girlfriend started yelling out fadiddle, and I corrected her saying it was a Padiddle. The source of all correct answers (the internet) proved me right. But I thought I would be thorough and kick the dead horse, so I looked up fadiddle. And, well damnit, at least she has a reason to believe that it was fadiddle, being from ERIE PA and all. ; I guess when you are from Erie, you can just make up your own words and people will take them on as a new vocabulary. ; 'pushimal' - When you have too much homework to do, and you are doing everything but it. That'll be my entry.
