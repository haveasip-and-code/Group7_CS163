moosemove
Otherwise known as 'pulling/doing the moose', the 'moosemove', is an ambiguous practice, and is most common among inexperienced men during the art of sexual practice. It is usually defined as mistaking the anus for the vagina or clitoris, so is usually 'pulled' during foreplay or '[doggy] sex'.
