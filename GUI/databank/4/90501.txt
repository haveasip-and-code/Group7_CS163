Amerika
1) The slavic way of spelling 'America' ; 2) A song performed by [Rammstein] in their album 'Reise, Reise' (Arise, Arise). While the song appears to be patriotic in the American sense, the deeper message is anything but patriotic; the lyrics clearly parody the sense of American patriotism, but many critics have argued that Rammstein's message in the song was to satirize the widespread adoption of American Culture spread throughout the world (as suggested by the Asian monks eating American fast food in the song's music video). As with many of Rammstein's songs, the message about America isn't entirely clear; but one thing's for certain: It definitely isn't praise for America.
