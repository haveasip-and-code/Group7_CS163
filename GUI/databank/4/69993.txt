sifl and olly
A sock-puppet show on MTV that featured two puppets (named Sifl and Olly) that repeated the same foundation every week but with different things included (i.e. there would always be a 'Letters for Chester' session, but the letters and what would ensue would change every week). Appeals to teens and people seriously high on any & every kind of imaginable drug.
