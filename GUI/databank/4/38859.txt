day rave
(n.)- the worst idea ever. it's basically this big outdoor party where a bunch of totally hung-over and zonked-out people sorta show up and stand around feelin shitty while giant lawn speakers blast techno music, amplifying everybody's headaches from the night before. the only people that aren't completely out of it at these things are the (blind) DJs and the cops, who always show up in the middle of things to take all the people 'home.' i've only gone to one of these things and it was one of the worst experiences that i've ever had.
