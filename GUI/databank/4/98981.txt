street cred
short for [street credibility] ; (n)- repsect from [urban] communities. usually something essential for making it big in the [rap world]. it is wrongly percieved as being a [straight up gansta] or committing [crimes]. [street cred] is something one can [earn], even a [rich kid] or [suburb-dweller]. if you have went through a [tough childhood] or life but have worked hard to make something of yourself [(like me)], then you can [earn street cred], even if you are not from the [streets]. if [ghetto kids] like a [rap artist] who started out rich, but rapped about important things in life and is simply a good rapper, then that rapper has [street cred]. if you buy a [rap album] just because the rapper is [gansta], then you are [fucked up]. ; a funny thing is, most street rappers are not that great, some of the greatest [lyricists] of all time were not always from ['tha ghetto']
