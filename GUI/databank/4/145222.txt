Five-Five-Fiving
Verb -- [Freaking out] or [tripping] on drugs, usually psychadelic [mushrooms] or hallucenogens.. Inspired by the song 'Five-Five-Five,' by Frank Zappa. The instrumentals tend to inspire people to take drugs. Once in a state of inebriation, the maddening guitar riffs of 'Five-Five-Five' make Phish look like O'Dweeds compared to the wicked buzz you cop from Frank's Fiver. Which is ironic, because Frank Zappa was very much against drugs. ; Also simply referred to as Fiving, rolling with Frank's bunch, or 2F.
