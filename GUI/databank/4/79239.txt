Wyzaard
An asura of progressive argument. Holds himself and others to nigh-impossible standards of connective thought and action; this in turn drives him and others insane with implications filled with both limitless hope for the better and bottomless depair in the face of the inevidible. The Wyzzard will often question the underlying terms and structures of online discussions, typically those dealing with religion, philosophy, and politics; seldom do such chats end with any sort of consensus, only a richer tapestry of contentious queries.
