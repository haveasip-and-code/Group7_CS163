Spike Spiegel is the main character of the hit anime series Cowboy Bebop, a member of the crew of the Bebop, pilot of the Swordfish mk. II and the baddest mothafucka alive. Spike is proficient in [jeet kune do] and is an excellent pilot and marksman. He works as a bounty hunter alongside his companions Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Ed, and Ein. Throughout the series, Spike remembers hints of his past, such as his arch-nemesis Vicious and his long-lost (and pretty damn hot) lover, Julia.
