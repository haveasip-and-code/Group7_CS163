icecube english
When you have an icecube in your mouth it is very hard to talk properly. For example, when you've just put it in, it is virtually impossible to pronounce any consonants, making you vocally inept. However, as it melts in your mouth you slowly regain your power of voice. This is all known as icecube english. It continues for a short while after its fully melted as well.
