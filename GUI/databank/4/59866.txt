dandy
Used widely in late 20th Century England. Refers to men who consider themselves to be arbiters of culture and refinement and wit. Often considered effeminate and/or overtly [flaming]. Most likely sexually aroused by other men, but not always. Similar to today's [metrosexual]. For example, most of Oscar Wilde's plays contain dandies, and Oscar Wilde himself is perhaps the most famous example of a dandy.
