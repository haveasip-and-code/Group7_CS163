dethaw
A confusing conjunction of 'defrost' and 'thaw'. Has a corresponding etymology to unthaw. Literally it means to refreeze, however, it has never actually been used correctly in conversation. Ever. In fact, it is always used to mean the opposite- a synonym for thaw. Just say thaw, not dethaw, not unthaw, just thaw.
