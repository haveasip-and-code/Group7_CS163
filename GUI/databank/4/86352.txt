Cloud Nine
A Cloud Nine is an easy way to be launched into a high euphoria. First, the person who is going to be cloud nined must flatten against a wall, and then bend over. After that, they must hyperventilate for 1 to 2 minutes. After hypervetilating, they suck in all air and hold their breath. After that, they once again go back against the wall with their breath held. A second person must then immediately cut off all blood and oxygen going to the brain, by placing their hands over the cloud niner's throat, as if they were choking the cloud niner. After this, the cloud niner should pass out for a few seconds and then awake. When the cloud niner awakes, they have little knowledge of anything around them and don't remember who the people are around them, no matter how good of friends they are with the people surrounding them. This usually sends the cloud niner into a shocked state. WARNING: This entry can not be held responsible for any cloud nine related injuries due to taking instruction from it, because I simply was told what it was like from a friend.
