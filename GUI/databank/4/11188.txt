Work Order
A paper or electronic request for service. An easy way to make someone else do a task that another person ether can't do or is not willing to do themselves. A way to proclaim a individual's false superiority over an intelligent individual without actually meeting with that individual. A professional manner in which to fix something an individual has broken by proxy. A dark stain on an otherwise bright day.
