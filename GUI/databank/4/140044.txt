anime girl
Any girl who talks about nothing but anime, spends half of her life on the computer, and puts little ASCII kitty faces at the end of all her IM or forum posts. <b>Not all girls who like anime are anime girls, though.</b> Anime girls usually dress either preppy, like a Japanese schoolgirl, or their mom picks out all their clothes. ; If you have ever shopped in Hot Topic, relax, you're not an anime girl.
