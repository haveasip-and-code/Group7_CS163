cheats
A card game where you use a standard 52 deck of cards and there can be as many players as you want. The dealer hands out all the cards til there's none left. Each player can look at there cards and the first person lays down a card face down and says the card he put down. It starts as a ace so you would put down A card and say that BUT it could be anything else other then a real ace. If another player say's cheats! and you put a fake ace and its not a ace you must pick up the whole pile in the middle where you put down cards though the game. If you put down a real ace and some one said cheats then he must pick up the whole pile in the middle. You win the game by losing all your cards and it get's very hard at the end when you have litte cards left and you must lie alot. You can also put down more then 1 of the same card like you would say '3 jacks!' and you can lie there also and jokers are wild. This game is also known to be called [bullshit] like in the movie How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.
