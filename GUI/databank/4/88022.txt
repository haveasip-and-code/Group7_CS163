playdate
The modern day equivalent of an arranged marriage. Two separate parents who accept each others children as compatible persons arrange a meeting, preferably in an [electronic organizer], and then force the two unknowing, possibly unwilling children to various activities including, but not limited to, playing in a needle infested sandbox, general playground play, and swimming. Provided that no one is ever injured, this can lead into adolescence where preparations for marriage can ensue. Pairing of gay or suspected gay children are permitted as this is socially accepted among those who playdate.
