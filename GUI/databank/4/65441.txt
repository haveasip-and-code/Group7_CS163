Sally Safety
A female driver with so many kids in the minivan, she can't remember whether or not she buckled all of them in. Thus, she would rather inflict her sub-speed limit driving on the rest of society than do her errands when the kids are in school. She generally waits until rush hour to pack her vehicle with rowdy, screaming kids then drives absentmindedly and distractedly through suburbia.
