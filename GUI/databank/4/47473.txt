ib
A program created in an attempt to control the minds of the youths of the future, implemented by Swiss [lawn gnomes], by preventing their exposure to the outside world. ; The state goals of the program are to provide students with an education rounded out accross five program areas ('groups') - including Language 1, Language 2, Social Sciences, Science, Math, and Art/Option. Additional elements of the program include CAS (a system used to force students out of the house once in a while), ToK (philosophy) and Extended Essay. ; In an attempt to shove too much information down the throats of students, the program ends up significantly improving the core skill required to succeed in IB: Bullshit. The phrase I.B. therefore I [B.S.] comes from this.
