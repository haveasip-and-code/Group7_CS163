ICon
The only remotely interesting thing that happens within a 50 mile radius of [Miller Place] In which furries, vampires, trekies and other various degrees of nerdiness gather to buy overpriced food and spiffy fantasy cosplay outfits. After running around until their fat legs cannot run anymore, they sit down and play RPGs until 2 in the morning when security kicks them out.
