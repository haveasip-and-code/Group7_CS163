Yorkshire Man
A man from Yorkshire. Of course, it's a highly coveted attribute that's only achievable by having a mother with enough foresight to realise the best place to go to give birth. Sadly, those who're unfortunate enough to be born outside of Yorkshire (say, for example, in [Lancashire]) do tend to get rather jealous and slag Yorkshire men and women off. ; See also [Yorkshireman].
