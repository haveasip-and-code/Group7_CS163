The One Ring
In Tolkienish mythology, the one master controlling ring, fashioned by the Dark Lord Suron in secret deep in the mines of moria. It can only be destroyed by casting it into the fires of mount Doom in the evil land of Mordor. It is, By Frodo, Son of Drogo, heir of Bilbo Baggins, who inherited Bilbo's estate of Bag end when he left for the elven stronghold of rivendell on his 111st birthday. THe one ring has a good amount of the power of The dark one and corrupts those who hold onto it for too long, though it has a mind of its own. It was originally cut from the hand of Sauron by Isildur, KIng of Gondor, who kept it instead of casting it into the fires from where it came. It then came to the hands of Smaegol, later to be known as Gollum. GOllum retreated into a cave in the Misty mountains and hid there, allowing the ring to turn him to the control of Sauron. Bilbo Baggins found the ring, and kept it, after 'winning' it from gollum in a riddle contest. THe ring then went with Bilbo back to Bag end, where he kept it for many years, until his heir frodo inherited it, and began the quest to destroy it, thus becoming the ringbearer. He eventually did, destroying the ring for all eternity.Below it the full text of the elven verse written on the One ring, the RIng of Power (as produced by the chronicles of the Lord of the Rings, printed in 1965)
