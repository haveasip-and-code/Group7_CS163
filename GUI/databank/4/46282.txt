laver bread
Pronounced 'Larver', laver is an edible seaweed commonly found on the south west coast of Wales (around Swansea). Laver has to be prepared at great length by washing many times, and boiled for up to 5 hours and drained to form a gelatinous puree. It is mixed with fine oatmeal, formed into small cakes and fried in fat. If you are after a traditional authentic flavour serve it with some vegan bacon. ; Of course, in olden times, and even now in the countryside, there was a hot cooking 'range' constantly available, so extended cooking times for things like laver were no problem. Nowadays it is less convenient (but you could try using a pressure cooker or microwave) ; I have no idea why it is called 'bread'!
