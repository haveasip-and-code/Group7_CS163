Maki
Maki is a term used when refering to bodily excretions of solid waste. Previously used in regards to activities taking place in the bathroom, this term has spread far beyond the reaches of the porcelain throne. Maki is anyone, anybody, anything, and everything that is 'shitty'. Maki is often used as a verb with the core word Mack.
