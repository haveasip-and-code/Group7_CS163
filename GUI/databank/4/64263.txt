no name
1: The username of someone who lives in Medford Lakes. This person has a way of being so unbelievably mean on urbandictionary.com to people it is absolutely infuriating. This disgusting piece of filth has no curse words to describe it, though my friends would say other things. Some people didn't even deserve such foul ridicule this person gave on this site, but even if some did, others were my friends. ; 2: A person who has no label, goes by nothing, waits to be named or does not wish to be identified.
