Wala Wala Wacky Bing Bang
The act of reproducing babies first used by the native tribe, the Chapmans. This dance was called the Wala Wala. Used back in the 1800s, the Wala Wala dance became a symbol for sex as they hop on all fours. Later in the 1900s, men started to use the Wala Wala Wacky Bing Bang technique as they mastered it from the master, Jason C. In the mid 1900s, this technique has been mastered and used for the greater good of mankind. After one is finished performing this dance, they hope on one foot and yell Bing Bang for male pride.
