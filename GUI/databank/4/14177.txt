Detroit
A really awesome city that is stereotyped entirely way too much. Sure it is mostly black and has a large industrial landscape, but so what? None of those two are necessarily bad things. I love black people; they are awesome, and I personally love the [industrial architecture]. In addition, it is one of the birthplaces of modern rock and rap, and has one of the most kick-ass basketball teams: The Detroit Pistons. The [Detroit Tigers] are cool, too.
