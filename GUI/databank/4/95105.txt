biogasm
occurs when a biologist experiences an intense emotional excitement stemming from something they have observed. Examples of these observations are: (1) a rare plant blooming that the biologist has heard so much about but never seen in person, (2) an example from a book that the biologist read in school and found fascinating then but even more titillating in person, (3) seeing the fruit of the biologists labor.
