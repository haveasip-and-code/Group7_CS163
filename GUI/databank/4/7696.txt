This is the handle of a man who tries to regulate chat behaviour on the MSN gaming zone. He usually thinks he's above the law in all circumstances. He will kick you out of a room for using even the slightest profanity but doesn't hesitate to private message you threating to meet you in an ally and kick your ass. He also chastises people who's accounts were hacked into for being stupid enough to fall for the hacker's ploys yet soon later, he had his own account hacked; and very badly I might say. He has earned such a bad rap that his appearance was sharply abated and rumor has it, Microsoft fired him for such indecent behaviour.
