Harley yuppy
A suburban middle management type who buys a shiny new Harley Davidson to ride on the weekends, while togged out in pristine leathers. Thinks he is cool but is really just a pretentious brand name status seeker. The bike is usually in the garage next to the minivan and the trailer with the jet skis.
