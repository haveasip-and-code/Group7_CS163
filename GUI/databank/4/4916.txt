Speedy the Turtle
The saddest turtle in the world. Lives in the basement of the Cunha residence. Even in harsh times such as Winter with no heat. Its home is a small plastic container hardly bigger than the length of this keyboard which I am typing on. If you tap on its shell it tries to swim away but to no avail for it is trapped for all eternity.
