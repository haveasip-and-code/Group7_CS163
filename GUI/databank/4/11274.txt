Webmasters
Bunch of lazy born idle morons who sit on their fat arses and do absolutley nothing. They sit on aol messenger all day and night and their idle away messages stay on. There are some decent webmasters out there that get themselves a job and come home and go on the internet and do their sites. People like Timothy Hoffmeyer from Michigan, USA, just sit on their born idle backsides and can't be bothered to get a job.
