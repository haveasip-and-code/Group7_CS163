orchestra
1)A group of strings-players that come together to play music ; 2)The most unrecognized group in High School. Like band, there are very memorable experiences that involve losing your virginity and long trips on the bus. Everyone lets loose in this cursed bus. Also, most of the insanity comes from the antics of the [Cello] and Bass sections, and sometimes by the Principal Violinist.
