PALSEY
This fierce yet delicate creature you may find in a wide spectrum of venues from a four star restaraunt to an alley in the hood.This is a cross between a 55 and an Odle with a little bit of Keith in the middle.To spot a Palsey just look for good CREDICKS and a DROOPY face.But look to long and you might loose a front.
