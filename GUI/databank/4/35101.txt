The Last Great Console
SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System for the [noobs]), the high king over all gaming systems, made legendary by such games as Super Metroid, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, the mario titles it carried over including the one with yoshi and the all star pack, FFX, the Donkey Kong games, and the badass Megaman series, especially Megaman X 3. Only the Sega Genesis could ever rival it, and that only due to the Sonic Series. As [Nintendo] proceeds to develop their halfass [game cube] platform, the SNES remains the greatest of all consoles ever made.
