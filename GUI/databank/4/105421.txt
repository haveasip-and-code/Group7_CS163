Hokie Harlem
The Upper Quad at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA. Hokie Harlem is the neighborhood of the famed Corps of Cadets at VT, as well as several unfortunate civilian souls. ; Characterised by depressing brick buildings, instead of the traditional Hokie Stone found elsewhere on campus, Hokie Harlem is probably not as shady as the name implies, but nevertheless is not the kind of place one feels comfortable strolling alone at night. ; Close proximity to the Tech electrical plant adds to the general skeeviness of the place. ; Shultz dining hall is also located in Hokie Harlem.
