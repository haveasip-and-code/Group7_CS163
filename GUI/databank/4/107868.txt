manslaughter
1. accidental murder ; 2. murder but the murderer has got away with it by making his plea of manslaughter ; 3. what danny's gone up for even though he did not mean to a) crash the car or b) kill his girlfriend, so i think its stupid as no one could have stopped the crash from happening except i guess he was speeding, but its still out of order as loads of people speed and crash their cars but they dont go up for mansluaghter, hes still only a teenager, isnt it bad enough his girlfriend has just died???
