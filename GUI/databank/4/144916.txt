unwashable
An unwashable is someone who intentionally discards any sort of personal hygiene. An unwashable never bathes or wears clean clothes, never brushes teeth or combs his or her hair. Very similar to crusties and gutterpunks, but even more religiously so. They are rare and often living on the fringe of society, though famous and succesful unwashables are known
