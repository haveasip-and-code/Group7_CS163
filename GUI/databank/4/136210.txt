TK
In the gaming world, TK usually as an abbreviation for 'Team Kill' but it can also be used with the meaning of 'Type Kill'. ; Team Killing is when you shoot someone on your own team, Type Killing is shooting people that are standing still and obviously typing a chat message (many games indicate this graphically, but beginners either don't see this or are just so thrilled they can finally get a kill that they ignore it).
