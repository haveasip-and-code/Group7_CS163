wyrd
The Norse idea of an unescapable fate, also the goddess of fate. When wyrd was brought about, by the God Loki, the other Norse gods would, through a series of greusome events, perish, and the world would die - in some translations of Norse myths wyrd will have a second comming, implying that it happened once before.
