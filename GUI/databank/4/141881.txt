Curb Job
I am sure it existed before the song but on the album 'The Incredible Shrinking Dickies' in 1979 there is a song called 'Curb Job' as far as I remeber it was always a skinhead thing where a person bites the curb and has the back of there head stomped- and would be shown in the film American History X many many years later
