queen dog
Queen dogs are the stuck up sorority girls at major colleges that dress skimpy all the time, wear LIVESTRONG bracelets, get drunk at parties, 'go out' Wednesday through Sunday night, wear too much make-up, chew their gum with their mouth open and drive cars their parents bought for them. It is fully acceptable and expected to YELL 'queen dog!!' extremly loud when in the presence of a queen dog; they will just look at you weird.
