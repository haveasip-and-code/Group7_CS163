vug
To take something entirely promising and make a mess out of it. Currently becoming a popular phrase amongst gamers. The term comes from the actions taken by a certain game publisher to mismanage a certain franchise and their inability to support anything they do. (ED. Not unlike Norman Mailer's 'fug' from 50 years ago, especially if 'vug' is pronounced as if it were German.)
