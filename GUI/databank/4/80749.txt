hide-and-seek
It's a game! You can play with 2 or more players.This is how you play: ; First, pick someone to 'seek'.You can do this by flipping a coin if you are playing with only two players. If you are playing with three or more players, everybody will have to mutually decide who will seek,or you can [draw straws]. Next, the person who is the 'seeker' has to find a corner, cover his eyes, and face the wall and start counting (I recommend counting to 30,but you can also count to 45 or 100 if you want). While the 'seeker' is busy counting, the 'hider(s)' will hide. When the 'seeker' is finished counting, he will commence 'seeking' for the 'hiders'. The winner is the person who is found last in a hide-and-seek game of three or more, and the winner of a two-person game would naturally be the 'hider', no matter what, as he wins basically by default.
