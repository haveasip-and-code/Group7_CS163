Abercrombie
Abercrombie is a really preppy store. Some people like it, some don't. There is absolutely nothing wrong with people who shop there. I don't see why anyone should make fun of it. Preps don't make fun of goths. Why should goths make fun of preps? People who can't stand abercrombie are morons who have no lives.
