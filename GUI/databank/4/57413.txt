Some guy who owns a GameFAQs account who has the last user id number that can access LUE. Because of this, and the fact that the Matrix was pretty fresh back then, a lot of people on LUE started claiming him as the Saviour of LUE. Once into LUE though, he was outcasted for his bad grammar and his non-LUEish attitude.
