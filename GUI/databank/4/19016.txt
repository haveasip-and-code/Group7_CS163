Clubbers nipple
During the late 1980s and early 1990s doctors started to see dishevelled ravers with chaffed nipple surfaces due to prolonged dancing rubbing the body part against synthetic fabric, seams,stitched logos or talc in the case of PVC outfits. The combination of sweat from MDMA use, inflamed the friction wound even further.
