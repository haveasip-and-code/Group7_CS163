Little Nemo: The Dream Master
One of Capcom's often-overlooked [NES] games I missed out on during my youth, because I was too busy playing their war games, like 'Bionic Commando' and 'Code Name Viper.' ; This rather fun video game was loosely based on Windsor McCay's 1905 comic strip 'Little Nemo's Adventures in Slumberland.' Finally, a game with a historical basis, instead of the product of someone's pipe dream.
