comedy bitch
A person is a comedy bitch if they are used by their peers for their own amusement irrespective of the shame and embarassment it may cause the bitch. However, the bitch in question must be a willing party. ; This phrase was created by [James Wilson] in the aftermath of the infamous [James Morgan wearing stupid looking hats incident] (one of which was quite clearly Russian and shouldn't be worn by anyone except Russians and as shown by the incident, comedy bitches).
