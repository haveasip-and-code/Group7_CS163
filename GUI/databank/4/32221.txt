episciple
One of the main figures whose quotes and sayings provide the foundation of the beliefs and methods of the super-right-wing political organization, [H.A.T.E.] As of January 2005, there are three episciples, and they are, in no particular order, Dan Quayle, Denis Leary and Mike Tyson. New episciples are selected by the current leaders of [H.A.T.E.] When a candidate for an episciple is found, a review of their notable quotes is reviewed, and if the leaders feel that their quotes represent the beliefs of [H.A.T.E.], they are declared an episciple.
