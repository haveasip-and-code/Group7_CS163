The Mog
The nickname given to Mogadishu, Somali by U.S. Forces in that region in 1993 during Operation Restore Hope. It was in 'The Mog' where the Battle of Mogadishu (Blackhawk Down) took place. ; It is very dangerous, and if you are a white guy going through the Bakara Market area, be sure to have 10 layers of kevlar and a few guns.
