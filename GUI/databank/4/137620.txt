Nerd's Rant
A condition often displayed on forums and guestbooks internet-wide. Nerd's Rant is a truly devastating phenomenon, made even more so by translation into GeekSpeak, aka 'Leet'. ; Nerd's Rant usally comes up in protest to an unsatisfactory post, or incorrect reference to [All Your Base] or [Numa Numa], thus angering the Nerd, causing an explosive showering of acronyms and stupid insults.
