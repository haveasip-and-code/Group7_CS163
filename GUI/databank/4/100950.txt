SCOUSER
Person from Liverpool. Scousers are generally welcoming, fun loving, hardworking and a talented breed of people. Over the years there has been a wealth of talent come out of Liverpool and that flame still burns bright today. Let me also mention that Liverpool will now be the Capital of Culture 2008, and with the funding from Europe, it can only make Liverpool even better. As for the people who like to use old boring stereotypes made popular in the 1980's, I really would like you to come and see for yourself. Either that or check the crime and unemployment stats, Liverpool has higher EMPLOYMENT rates and LOWER crime rates than the likes of Manchester and areas of London.
