Enix
Makers of the Ever and more popular then Final Fantasy 'In japan' Dragon Warroir/Quest games. When these games come state side most of the time they are not looked at because of the old school look and the fact people want 30 hour RPG's like Final Fantasy or just want Final Fantasy because it is just that. Enix has had a long history in making quality RPG's. ; Enix merged with Square a few years back. Kind of a bad thing being Square will try to drag them into the dirt somehow and make their Final Fantasys look great. ; Who knows what the future holds for Enix really...all I hope for is Dragon Warrior to come state side.
