republic commando
great star wars themed first person shooter for xbox and pc. despite being a star wars title, it defies their habit of making childish games and makes a game everty bit as thoughtful as halo: combat evolved. in it, you command a squad of clone commandos during the clone wars. they are an elite squad fo four, and you complete various missions behind enemy lines.
