brain stew
i do beleive all the other definitions of the word, but i have to argue with the one about it not doing crystal meth, it clearly says 'spun out in my room,' which means that you are high on crystal meth, so maybe the song is a mixture of beth definitions, and if not, why did billie joe use the term, spun?
