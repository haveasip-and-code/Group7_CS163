Naples
A city in southern Italy. Once a wonderful city it is now plaugued with mafia violence. It is home to the worst and most feared mafia organization in the world, The Camorra. There are different clans of the camorra that often war with each other over the sales of drugs, prostitution, and controlling businesses. It is more of a threat to Italy than the sicialian mafia was, which is now decreasing. I am Italian and have been to Naples, and let me tell you, don't look at anybody the wrong way, becuase you might end up with a few holes in you.
