Kip
It comes from the movie Napoleon. and its pretty much a cool thing to say to a person that is obsessed with the computer. If you get online every day no matter what.. your kip. If you cant do anything else because you are so invloved with the computer.. your kip. If after you do what you needed to do on the computer but yet you stay on for hours surfing the web.. your kip. If you get on the computer to do homework and end up not doing it or it takes you hours because your chatting with babes.. your kip. If you found nothing wrong with anything I just said.... YOU ARE KIP.
