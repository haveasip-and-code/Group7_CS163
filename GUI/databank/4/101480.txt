toda moda
definition: a word describing anyone or anything you could possibly want it to explain. ; background: the store in Josua tree near the crals junior that sells fashionable items for that part of the world. Teenage girls from Glendale CA began abusing the rediculous word and making it a fun inside joke that now the entire world knows as...toda moda.
