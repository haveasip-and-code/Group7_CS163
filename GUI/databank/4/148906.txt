ASHTRAY
Young women of the Province of Ontario (Canada), usually good looking, with a superb aptitude for putting off men's desire for them. The 'ashtray' status is usually achieved by (1) wearing ample, non-sexy-non-revealing clothing, (2) using questionable makeup in social contexts, (3) not being able to hold one's liquor, or (4) a combination of the previous elements.
