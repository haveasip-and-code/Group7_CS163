Parkinson's law
Parkinson's law is an administrative principle that states that work tends to expand in relation to the time available for its completion. From C. Northcote Parkinson, a professor of the University of Malaysia, who first wrote of this law. While Parkinson, like Laurence J. Peter, apparently wrote his book as a satire on administration, unfortunately it turned out to be true.
