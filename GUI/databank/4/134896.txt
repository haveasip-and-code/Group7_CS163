Bone Thugs
A rap group who made it big with their unique style of raps. One of the last real rap groups. In the 1999's they were very populer. ; In 2000 member 'Flesh N Bone' was arrested on weapons charges after threatening a friend with an AK-47,and being found with an illegal sawed-off shotgun.Flesh N Bone is now serving a 6 year sentence,expected to get out of jail late 2005,or early 2006. ; After Flesh N Bone went to jail,Bizzy Bone got kicked out of the group because he would get really drugged up and would barely be able to stand on stage,though he sometimes never even showed up on stage. ; Now the rap group consists of Wish Bone (AKA Straight Jacket),Krayzie Bone (AKA Sawed-off-Leathaface),and Layzie Bone(AKA L-Burna)They dropped an album in 2005 called 'Bone 4 Lyf' that has recently gone gold. ; Now a-days bone thugs are still keepin it real,but have very little(almost no) public attention,so they make a living off off internet releases and their fan base. ; Bone Thugs are still among the best rappers to ever walk the earth,they just arnt getting the attention they diserve. ; Each member,except for Wish Bone,has more than one solo album out,these are by far some of the best rap albums out there,and seriously show some skill. ; Layzie Bone and Bizzy Bone teamed up to make a 'Bone Brothers' album,featuring the outlawz,Krayzie,and Wish,the album was a hit,and showed some of the best bone material yet. ; Bizzy Bone was invited back into a contract with bone in early 2005,but he didnt want it,he explained to Krayzie he wasnt ready yet,but he wants to be back in Bone. ; Though Bizzy is regarded as crazy,fans still a wait when he'll join Bone again,as he is one of the best rappers of the group,if not THE best rapper of the group. ; Bizzy Bone dropped an album in 2005 called 'Speaking in tongues' featuring small unknown artists,the album was good,but not as good as '10 years in the making' should sound.
