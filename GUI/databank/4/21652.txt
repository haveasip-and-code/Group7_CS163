Internet Whore
Someone who competes with others for the sole purpose of gaining a name for themselves online. A person who has no life whatsoever in the real world, that they must put on shows to make a nice online reputation. These people should be pitied for their inability to make anything out of themselves when a computer and AOL aren't present.
