Nelo Angelo
A commonly seen (and quite mysterious) enemy from the popular videogame, [Devil May Cry]. Not much is known about this character, but the player eventually learns that it is Vergil, of Dante's rather disfunctional family. Boasting incredible speed and unbelievable demonic power, he is a great match for Dante. He is also the main focus of the upcoming prequel, [Devil May Cry 3]: Dante's Awakening.
