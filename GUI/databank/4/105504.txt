bounce mode
the positioning of your car while parking so you can pull forward out of the spot. In a parking lot this requires pulling through a spot, or backing in. For parallel parking this means to take the forwardmost spot in a line of spots. Referred to as bounce mode because it awards the driver the fastest possible escape, or ability to 'bounce'. Always handy in a qustionable situation.
