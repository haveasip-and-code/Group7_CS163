toffee
Supporter of by far the most emphatic team in the beautiful game. Hater of [Kopite]s. Trustworthy by definition, these honourable lads and ladies forge a belief in what is possible through sheer determination and style: a class that can never be matched by the cheap nouveau riche [red shite]. Toffees are people of directness, unparalleled by any, not afraid to speak out in the name of truth and integrity. The wrongs of Europe will be righted. It is only a matter of time and belief.
