18
The age when you get to DO WHAT YOU WANT. It can kind of suck because you have a lot more responsibilites and shit, but as long as you arent livng with your parents they can't choose your friends, give you a curfew or say shit about the people you date. Therefore if you missed out on partying it up when you were a young teenager because of your parents strict rules now is the time to do so.
