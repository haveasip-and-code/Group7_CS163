The date was June 1, 1921, when 'Black Wall street,' the name fittingly given to one of the most affluent all-black communities in America, was bombed from the air and burned to the ground. In a period spanning fewer than 12 hours, a once thriving 36-black business district in northern Tulsa lay smoldering. A model community destroyed, and a major Black economic movement resoundingly defused.
