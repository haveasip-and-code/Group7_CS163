Gribble
'Gribbling' is being completely unaware of events that are going on around you, especially those that are completely obvious. Comes from King of the Hill's Dale Gribble, whose wife is having an affair, and he is the only person who is completely oblivious to what is so obviously going on between his wife, Nancy and her lover, John Redcorn.
