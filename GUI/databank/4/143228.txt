snowblade
Snowblades are small twin tipped ski's. To use requires no skill, style or consideration of other slope users. ; A bit like rollerblading on snow with the same annoying characters doing the 'sport'. ; The most fun to be had is to cut the little f@#kers up and watch them face plant whilst going past on your propper sized snowboard or skis.
