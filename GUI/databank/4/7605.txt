Seven Faces
my favorite and one of the most recent songs of Slayer. This song is unlike most of their songs which deal with killing people and satan, but this one does relate to reliegon dealing with the seven fatal sins and how people change throught out their lives. So I can actually relate to this song which is very rare when it comes to Slayer because I don't not go around killing people and worshipping satan :P
