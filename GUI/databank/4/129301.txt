Crazy Asshole
Not your commonplace, garden variety asshole. This asshole is far more clever and is very skilled in the art of making simple-minded fools go completely insane. Has the annoying habit of continuous nonsensical babble, and also loud, ornery vocal outbursts. They usually travel in pairs but are known to have gathered in groups of as many as 6 or 7 to go pestering poor, innocent people who wish to be left alone in the woods. Most will grow to be cenial old men who sit on their porch, play banjo, and talk to themselves (Damnit, Damnit, Damnit!).
