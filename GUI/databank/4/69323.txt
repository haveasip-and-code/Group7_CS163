bofh
B(astard) O(perator) F(rom) H(ell). The all too well-known system administrator. Usually one who has been sysadmin for too long and has either stopped caring about his users, or become too power-hungry, or maybe he's just a mean person, who knows. One day, when I start a personal network, I too wish to become a BOFH. ; Bytehway: if you have a female BOFH, would that be bitchy operator from hell or something?
