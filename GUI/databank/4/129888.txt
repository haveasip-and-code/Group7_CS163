Hector
A Hector is any extremely hirsute person, typically of very swarthy skin tone. Hectors are commonly found in tropical areas, but are quite far-ranging. In more temperate areas with lesser amounts of sunshine, Hectors are known to absorb available sunlight, lessening the amounts available to others. This absorption of sunlight often causes them to sweat profusely, sometimes resulting in an unpleasant odour. See [Hector smells].
