R2D2
The [1337]est character to ever grace the eyes of film viwers. He is a ship repair droid and AI enabled robot. He has the ability to serve drinks, fly, destroy battle driods, and hack into anything with a port. Without the [pimp] [skillz] of R2D2 the Jedi and their powers would vanish at the hands of the Trade Federation, The Empire, the Separatists, and the Sith.
