90210
90210 is an postal zip code in Beverly Hills, California. It is followed by 90211, and 90212. 90212 is mostly apartments and smaller homes, and the value of homes increases as the zip code decreases. ; 90210 IS THAT shiz of all area codes in the Continental US. It DOES OWN other zip codes because its' residents make more money than ones in other cities. We don't think it, we know it. Why do you think we prevented the LA Marathon from crashing thru Beverly Hills? Do you think we would want to close our businesses just because a bunch of liberal idiots wants to shed pounds after reading the South Beach Diet? HELL NO! ; WE MAKE MONEY ON SUNDAYS, AND WE PUT MONEY ON BUSINESSES THAT ALREADY MAKE BILLIONS PER YEAR! THATS WHY WE ARE THE SHIT AND SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED! ; One minor gruff: We've got too many iranians here. Most of them are rude and violate human sanity codes. They are loud, and use their money made from oil to gorge their high school kids on Range Rovers, Benz's, BMW's, and throwing a FUCKING $200,000 BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR SOME SNOT NOSED, SPOILED BITCH WHO AIN'T GOT AN IDEA OF HOW TO MAKE 1 DOLLAR SCRAPING GRIM OFF THE TOILET.
