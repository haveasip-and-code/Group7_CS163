knacker drinking
When irish teenagers are underage and have nothing less to do they go knacker drinking this is where they buy (or some one who is over 18 buys for them) cheap alcohol (usually dutch gold or vokda) and drink it in woods or the side of the street parks are also popular.. its usually pissing rain and you go home feeling like shit and wet... but it was a night out and you dont feel the wet cause you are so drunk.. all is well until some night the gaurds catch you and you are brought home in the back of the cop car or your stomach gets pumped...
