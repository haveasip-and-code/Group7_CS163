fisticuffs
A primitive dance usually done by 2 males late at night initiated by a slur or a pretty girl. Who clench both their hands and together, and move them up and down over their face (elbows down) while jumping from side to side in front of each other. The dance rarely ends with both parties impressed with their own or their partner's performance.
