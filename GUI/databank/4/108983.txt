American Pie
A once great song by Don McLean, which has been ruined with association by that awful teen sex romp movie. Stupid people who only know about the movie should be killed. ; The song is about the untimely death of Buddy Holly. It is very interesting, and has many references to rock and roll heroes, such as the Beatles and Bob Dylan.
