poughquag
common slang: PQ (pee-cue) ; perhaps one of the most happening places in the greater new york region, that still gracefully maintains its charming 'small town feel'. its closest major city is poughkeepsie, but is far cooler. poughquag comes complete with 3 gas stations, a few housing developments, and 2 traffic lights. also home to stop & shop, the beekman rec and skate park, the john deer store, cumbys, barton orchards, joe the grower, dunkin donuts, pleasant ridge pizza, beekman beverage barn, the beekman plaza and its stentch...etc. basically its better than the town you are from. ; note: the youth population of the area commonly deem themselves the 'PQ crew' and are by far the coolest, raddest, funniest, most spontaneos group of kids ever...they rock...HARD. and that is fo sho.
