new jerusalem
The state of [New Jersey] in the USA. Used especially in [hip-hop] culture. Although [New Jersey] is directly across the [Hudson River] from [New York City], and thus shares much of the same status in terms of [hip-hop], many people nevertheless consider people who live in [New Jersey] second-class citizens compared to residents of [New York City] proper. Also [new jeruz].
