Lowell
First of all, i live in lowell massachusetts and you dont see 'atleast ten shootings a year' ive lived there for 18 years and havent heard a gun shot. not to say that it doesnt happen on occasion. most people like to get high and drive around on blunt rides and get wasted. its a nice place to live so stop wit all that stereotypical bull.
