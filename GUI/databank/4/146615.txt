bloomingdale's
A store with a large selection of popular clothing, accessory, and jewelry brands. Such as; Juicy Couture, Burberry, Chanel, and so much more. It pretty much fits into the category of Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. It is a little pricey, however, the atmosphere is so great that it's even fun to just shop around and try things on, even if you have no desire to buy them. If you are looking for something in particular however, the employees are very friendly, and helpful. They even have personal shoppers to assist the fashionably helpless/wealthy. It is basically just a great store.
