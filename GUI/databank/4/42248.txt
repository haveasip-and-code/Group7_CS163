GATSO
A clever device invented by a swedish rally driver to help him improve his driving, but once the UK government got to know about it then the little grey money boxes started appearing in places where they would make the best profit. They are just another one of Tony Blairs (see [arsehole]) schemes to milk and piss off all of his precious voters which I'm proud to say I'm not one!
