Tokyo Marui
The largest [airsoft] company I know of, based in japan. They manufacture 90% of the crappy [guns] I play with and against. They are pioneers in the development of the Automatic Electric Gun (AEG) with their [1990] release of the m16a1/2, fa-mas, mp5 series and g3's. They are incredibly common in airsoft because of their development of hicap mags carrying hundreds of rounds. They sacrifice duribility, fps, and rpms for the ability to use these hicap mags, and use batteries instead of gas. they are approximately 20 dollars cheaper than a used classic gun, but their upgrades cost much more. They also manufacture some gas pistols and spring guns which are obselete before you buy them as pistols have an accurate range of 12 feet in airsoft.
