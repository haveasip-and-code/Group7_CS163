Cummy
Piece of cloth or hankerchief used to collected ejaculated semen after male masterbation, usually left hidden under pillow or materess of teenage males. Used to prevent semen from spilling and staining the bed sheets - and supposedly to stop your mum from finding out how much you masterbate (but mums know what's going on - the smell is a giveaway!)
