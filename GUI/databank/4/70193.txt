Philipenis
From South Philadelphia, reference to those uncircumcized, somewhat irregular cock shapes in that part of Philadelphia. Most Philipeni are never upgraded to near mediocre, are never smelling good, should be cut off and sown to one's forehead so the term 'Philipenisunicorn' means something more than it already does.
