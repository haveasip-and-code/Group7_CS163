Michael Brown
The former head of the [Federal Emergency Management Agency]. Proof that kissing ass and being well connected are the only requirements for high level jobs in the [George W. Bush] administration. This person had no prior emergency management experience. The most incompetent Federal response to a crisis ever took place on this clown's watch. A contributing factor to so much death and destruction that it is sickening. A person who fell on his sword to protect our worthless President.
