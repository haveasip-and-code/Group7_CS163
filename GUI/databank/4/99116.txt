Catwoman
one of the many villans in the Batman (DC comics) series. Since her debut in the series she has had her own comic book series put out. ; she dresses in a leather cat suit and her weopon is a cat o' nine tails whip. ; She has had a love interest role with bruce wayne (batman) in both series and the movies. ; in one version of the comic her background story is basicly both her parents die and she is cast into the world of crime. shes in a constant battle with good and evil. ; She was a major minor character in the batman tv series and was in the 1966 batman movie. ; She was in the movie Batman returns played by michelle pfeiffer and the background story was way off the comic books. ; in the movie Catwoman she was played by halli berry, the movie did not fare well. ; Catwoman is a very awesome character in the DC comic world, my favorite.
