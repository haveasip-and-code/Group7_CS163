ifia
A predicatable departure from the defined UFIA (Unsoliciate Finger in Anus), a popular slang acronym found in discussion threads in the Farkropolis and the TotalFartopia of Drew Curtis' weird news agreggator website, fark.com. This derivation means 'insert finger in anus.' In many ways it has risen above the denotative meaning and has become an expletive acronym much like the FUBAR of yore.
