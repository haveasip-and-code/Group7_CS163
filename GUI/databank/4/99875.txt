Mandeep Sandar
Mandeep is a strange creature who has hair like a girl and never washes it. He often visits the chip shop to dip his hair in the grease to give it a nice shiny finish. He often sports many different head wears ranging from a hair band to a tea cosy to keep his mush warm. Very hairy indivdual with a strong smell of daddy's sauce.
