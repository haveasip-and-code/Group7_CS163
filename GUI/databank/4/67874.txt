4D in this case is having your senses heightened, so you don't see things in 3D as you usally do, you see them in 4D hear them smell them taste them touch them. it happens when you smoke alot of weed, just before you whitey mainly, so basically being real stoned. ; you seem to be able to read body language better, and figure things out, but way too lazy to move, and in my case my limb's such as my legs and arms, seem to move to the sound of music without my control. ; everything is warm in 4D and you generally feel good, but you can ffeel down when you realise the faults of your friends, and what makes you feel down is that your thinking about your friends in this kinda way ; but end of it's all good. ; the term for this 4D orginated in wolverhampton, by a guy called amit
