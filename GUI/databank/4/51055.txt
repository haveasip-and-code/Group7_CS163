CEVO
Cyber Evolution: A [counter-strike], [day of defeat] and [call of duty] league widely considered to be the first online gaming league in North America to be better than [CAL] ([Cyberathlete] Amateur League) This is because of CEVO's highly acclaimed [CMN] (CEVO Match Network) and CEVO's superior anti cheat software. ; CEVO's anti cheat software, while highly popular, has come under fire due to the fact that it scans your active processes (which makes people afraid that their privacy is in danger) ; Another complaint is that CEVO has a registration fee while CAL is free. However, most people agree that it is a small price to pay for a league without cheating, with knowlegeble and friendly admins, and for a chance at some prize money.
