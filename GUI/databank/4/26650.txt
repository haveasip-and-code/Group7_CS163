Lakitu
Villain from the Mario Bros. series. Looks like a fat, bald turtle with thick glasses. It rides a cloud and hovers near the top of the screen, following Mario wherever he goes. Lakitu is a heartless bastard because he seems to have no problem with pitching an infinite number of his spiked progeny to their death in an attempt to wound or at least annoy Mario. However, he was recently changed careers from most annoying Mario enemy ever, to doing camera work for Mario in his more recent 3-D games, as well as refereeing for the Mario Kart series.
