St. Ursula School
Often referred to as 'St.Useless,The Hell Hole, etc' ; This school is run by Nazis who watch your every move, and if you even look at a teacher the wrong way, they'll give you a demerit. The only school with beer-chugging, Irish, nun/principal, who thinks she's a leprican. The teachers always find a way to yell at you even if you did nothing wrong. You could walk down the hall, not doing a thing, and they'll pull you over and tell you that your shirts untucked, or your socks are too short, or ' you need to pull your hair up because it's in your face.'
