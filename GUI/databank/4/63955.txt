Culcheth
hey i live in culcheth! ; A Small boring village inbetween warrington and manchester but more towards the warrington side. ; The centre always used to be used for the skaters but then the chavs and scallis took over and have been hasseling the residents of culcheth. i personally think the skaters should re-take over the centre.
