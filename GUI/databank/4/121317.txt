bottom feeder
Someone who is willing to do just about anything to get a deal. It doesn't matter if what they're buying is junk, if they feel that the price is good, they'll do anything to get the deal (including standing in long-lines for hours and clipping dozens of coupons to physical violence and door crashing).
