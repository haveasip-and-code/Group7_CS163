the robberlanguage
A made up language by Astrid Lindgren the famous writer from sweden. ; anyway the grama i simple: you put an 'O' between every consonant and the vocals are the same so for an example if you want to write or say ; 'mate' it becomes 'momatote' , the 'M' becomes a MoM, and the 'T' becomes a 'ToT' and so on.
