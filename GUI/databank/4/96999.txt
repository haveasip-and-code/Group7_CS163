Greece
A country which didn't create science-Arabia did. Arabia also created maths. India and China created Medicine, Astronomy and Astrology. The Greeks didn't even invent the pillar, Koreans did. Overall, countries more ancient than Greece like China, India and the Middle East created everything the Greeks like to claim 'credit' for. Greeks weren't the creators. Indian scripts date back to 20,000 years ago, Greeks are only 2,000 years old. Also, India created the alphabet, as Sanskrit, and were the first people to actually write down written language. Once again, Greeks weren't even around at that point.
