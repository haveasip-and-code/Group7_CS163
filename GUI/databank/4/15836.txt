true love
True love is when u would sacrifice everything for your sweety. Its when nothing else matters to you but making hem happy. It's when u don't see yourself with anyone else but them. this love is so deep, so real. True love is when you miss them before you even leave, it's when you could listen to them talk all night and never get tired their your voice...It's when the thought of their name gives you butterflies, and when you see their smile when you close your eyes...That feeling is IRREPLACEABLE.<3
