plink plink
Commonly mistaken for bling-bling, plink-plink is an inexpensive alternative meant to look like real gold, platinum, or other forms of 'bling.' ; Since most people who would make use of bling are in a financial class that disallows expensive purchases, plink-plink is actually much more popular.
