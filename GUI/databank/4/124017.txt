juicing
intentionally bleeding, in professional wrestling. ; In pro wrestling, a wrestler will, at times, nick themselves with a hidden razor blade to show blood on camera. This helps sell the intensity of the fight to the audience. Oftentimes, the juicer will take aspirin before the fight to thin his blood, causing even more blood flow on-camera.
