A neighborhood where asians and also cool kids (like me) chill. It used to be a lot more scene (haha) and people used to hang out there and blade around, and sometimes Jack and Jeff would visit from Indiana (of course this is before they moved back). Kids would blade and hang out and drink soy milk and get dog shit on sticks and blow up pumpkins after halloween. Now it's all disintegrating but we might go there today.
