gabba
Extremely fast, aggressive and insane hardcore dance music usually exceeding 200 BPM with a big [phat] kick drum. See also [gabber] which is wrongly seen in USA as some kinda freaky screamo trash metal when in fact it is the same thing i.e. Hardcore [Tekno]. ; Also dutch for friend. A gabbahead is someone who likes hardcore tekno and who usually has a shaved head (see below)
