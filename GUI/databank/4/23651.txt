cuhvalry
Code of honor and loyalty between cuhs(see [cuh]), such as letting your fellow cuh have [shotgun] when he has rightfully called it , and vise versa, or not being an asshole, or being drug free. There is an exeption to this rule: the only sitting member of the cuhs whom is not drug free is tubby(but only because he is cool). ; Cuhs are also very strict follwers of 'bros before ho's'. NEVER!! ditch one of your fellow cuhs for a bitch. ; there is also a distinct lingo that the cuhs use; phrases like 'what it is cuh'-meaning 'what's up' ; or [basically], which is a highly frequently used word within the cuh circle. ; cuhs also us the phrase 'what it be' or 'what it ass be'(wiab). both of these phrases mean the same as [what it is] ; cuhvalry was adopted by the original cuhs: XAARON-CUHX TUB-CUH XASON-CUHX and ADAM-CUH. ; The also have hand gestures such as 'CP'(cracka plams!)- giving high five with the the inside of your palms(the white meat) and 'DAAHRKNESS!!'- The exact opposite; giving high five with the back of your hand(dark meat) ; One cuh will give another cuh CP usually after the other cuh has said something extroidinarily funny, or has done something really awesome, like puttin' a bitch in her place. ; Daahrkness is the same, but more sacred.
