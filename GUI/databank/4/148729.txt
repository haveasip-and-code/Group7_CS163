Shark-Bite
Taking a bite out of a FrozeFruit bar(by Bluebunny) or popsicle approaching from the side rather than from the top, which is the more conventional method here on Earth. A person may employ this technique to avoid someone elses frozen slobber(back-ice), or to sabotage the integrity of the frozen fruit bar's architecture....thereby, exposing the beneficial owner of the FrozeFruit bar to the catastrophic risk of a big mess.
