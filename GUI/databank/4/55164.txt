tahiti treat
Fruit drink spiked with sugar to practically the point of saturation. Fucking awesome drink that was phased out in the early 90's only to come back in certain areas since then under the name 'Tahitian Treat'. Unknown if the formula has changed drastically. ; If you've got bottles of 'C'-plus Fruit Frenzy, it'll definitely bring up memories of Tahiti Treat. I've wanted the real deal back for the last ten years though.
