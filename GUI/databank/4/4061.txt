tool shed
The second level of being a poser/loser. Someone who is 'whipped' or someone who thinks he's cooler than he really is. A toolshed usually dresses outside of the mainstream just to make others think he is cool. He is always a jackass. A female tool shed, though rare, shares these same characteristics, and usually operates by being a total bitch and thinking she is hotter than she really is. A tool shed is is a bigger loser than a tool, but not quite a hardware store.
