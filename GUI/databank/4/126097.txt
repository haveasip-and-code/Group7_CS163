William Paterson University
This school is definitely not known for its strong academic standards, and the kids who go here hardly made 1000 on their SATs, if at all. Although it can be fun from time to time because drinking and smoking is huge in the dorms, and there's the occasional frat party (they kick ass in the beginning of the year, then die down), the weekends are boring because most people go home to work or they're just bored. If more people stayed on campus, it wouldn't be so boring, NOW would it?? ; The kids here weren't the brightest of the bunch in HS (besides me - top 10% of my class, what what!). They don't even know who William Paterson was, or what a Pioneer (our mascot) is. However, most of them are kick ass and chill people who know how to have a good time when they want to.
