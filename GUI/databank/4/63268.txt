Medieval Times
a place in Buena Park Ca, on Beach Blvd where you pay a whole bunch of money to eat shitty food, drink expenisve, shitty mixed drinks, and watch a bunch of fake ass knights, on small ass horses, compete in tournament games, in hopes of winning the princesses heart. Oh yeah, and dont cheer for the red knight, he always loses. ; Nah, just kidding, its fun, and if you go, make sure you call your server 'farm boy'
