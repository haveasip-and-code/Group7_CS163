nirvana
A criminally overrated band fronted by Kurt Cobain. Though some good came of the band and the associated grunge scene (the destruction of Poison and Ratt), the negative effects were far more pronounced. Real metal was dealt a crippling blow as well, and depressing heroin rock was able to dominate thereafter. Though grunge died in 1995 with Cobain, the effects of Nirvana's 'whiney generation' revolution are still being felt today. Nu-metal and mallcore filled in the vacuum left by heavy metal, mimicing the simple chord progressions and detuned guitars that were present in the grunge movement. Post-grunge rock, which has blossomed into many lackluster subgenres, still bears the simplicity and downcast attitude, as well as the whiney vox of the grunge movement.
