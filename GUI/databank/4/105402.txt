Veela
1) A gorgeous yet bitchy creature that has the power to seduce any man, but will throw balls of fire at you if you piss one off. Mentioned in Harry Potter. ; 2)The Veela is also a very close relative of humans, but with interesting powers. Veelas are universally female, exceptionally beautiful, and can exert a strong grip over human males with their brand of sensual dancing. Any males watching will instantly be overcome with a desire to watch them and impress them with some great heroic feat. Even when they are not dancing, the Veela carries a certain aura which is deeply inspiring to men. The effect seems to wear off a little with age, as Arthur Weasley was able to resist the charm of the Veelas' dance at the Quidditch World Cup, whereas Harry and Ron were about to leap on them.
