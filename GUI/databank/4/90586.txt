wikinition
[URBANdictionary] entries that look like they belong on [Wikipedia]. We're talking page-long 'definitions' that could be printed off and turned in for credit at many institutions of higher education. ; See certain definitions under [emo], [punk] for examples. (Wikinitions often pop up when some poor soul is trying to re-educate [the masses] about what a word (music genre) originally meant.)
