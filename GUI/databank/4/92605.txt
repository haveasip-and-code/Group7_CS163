psilocybin
A hallucinigenic compound found in various strains of magic mushrooms (native to many countries in England). Very potent, producing an intense trip. Typically, the trip lasts around 4-6 hours. It is a psychedelic trip with many colors and shape shifting, ect. Often one will have a rather philosophic come down (the stage of the trip where the effects are wearing off).
