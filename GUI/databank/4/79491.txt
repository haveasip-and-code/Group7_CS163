jak salad
[jak salad] is a combination of jelly beans and (chocolate) kisses. This recipe was created by (me!) when a sentence in the 6th grade keyboarding book mentioned [jak salad] and students inevitably asked what it was . . . so I created ; J = jelly beans ; A = and ; K = Kisses ; Salad! Incoming 6th graders always look forward to it!
