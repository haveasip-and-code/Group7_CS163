tepi
[Tepi] in modern day society is something which is extremely desirable but cannot be attained unless sanctioned by the supreme goddess of [Tepi] herself. ; There is no substantiated proof of any [Tepi] worshipper ever claiming the prize of [Tepi] even under circumstances of extreme duress and mass destruction of a universal nature. ; It is written in the scriptures of the time that many [Tepi] worshippers have accumulated a large number of [Tepi points] over the course of their natural lives only to be disappointed by not being to fulfil their worldly desires and die unfulfilled and disillusioned.
