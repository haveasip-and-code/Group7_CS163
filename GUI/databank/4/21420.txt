high point
A game which is played while intoxicated by only the top drinkers in the world. The game requires an empty beer can and 2 players. Player one holds the can horizontal on a table while player 2 chops the can in an attempt to break it in half. Then player 2 spins the can to the 'highest point' (or usually the part of the can that will fuck the other persons hand up the most) and allows player 1 to chop the can. You take successive turns. The winner is the player who successfully breaks the can into two separate pieces. The winner will obtain bragging rights, and a bloody hand. You drink when you need a little more courage to submerge the side of your hand into a jagged bloody pile of aluminum.
