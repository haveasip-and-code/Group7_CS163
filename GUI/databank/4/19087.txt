The Lizard
Depending on his mood, this creature can be big or small; public or private. He will come out of his cage and play when he is in a state of elation; and when depressed, he tends to stay hidden from the outside world. He doesn't always have to be depressed in order to hide; sometimes he just wants to be by himself and 'hang out', so to speak. Sometimes he needs to be 'private' - having not the urge, nor the desire, to be looked at, touched, kissed, have his picture taken, shake hands with Hillary Clinton, etc. The Lizard has been in many different places; generally wet areas. He often finds himself in 'canals' of some sort, and in 'mouths' of rivers. This tends to happen when The Lizard (or 'Thick Lizzy' as he is nicknamed),has been drinking too much alcohol. The Lizard always wears a protective suit, however, when he swims in impure waters. Sometimes he just wants to put his feet in the water, without going all the way in...but most times, he thrusts right into the water and hits the ocean floor! In any event, Thick Lizzy is sure to get suited up...and that 'suits' him just fine. (No pun intended).
