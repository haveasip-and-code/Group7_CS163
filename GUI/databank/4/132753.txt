ehole
Short for 'email black hole', but obviously a play on 'a**hole'; a person who never replies to email of any kind. ; Note that people can be selective eholes -- not replying, say, to urban legends that are passed around. ; Someone can also be rendered into an ehole by a busy schedule -- see the second example below.
