Georgetown Prep Lacrosse
As one of the top prestigious teams in the nation, Prep finishes in the top 10-15 every year. We beat Landon in 2003 due to our incredible talent, and our remarkable defensive skills, and not because of our recruiting. Regardless of our national standing against the Landon School, we are always a better team. We respect our opponents and prepare for every game (not just the landon game).
