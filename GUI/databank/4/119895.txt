New Classical
Fuckin' A - Old classical is a boring, lame, useless waste of time. Today only old people listen to this crap and when they are dead, classical music will be gone forever. Every time a classical radio station goes off the air or a symphony orchestra goes bankrupt music gets better. This stuff can't go away soon enough.
