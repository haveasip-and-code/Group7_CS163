covenant
A collection of alien races consisting of Grunts, Jackals, Hunters, Elites, Brutes, Drones and Prophets. Humanity was not consumed by the Covenant and is therefore an enemy of the Covenant. Humanity's saviour, an augmented human (Spartan) named 'Master Chief' is the Human's last hope against those Covie Bastards.
