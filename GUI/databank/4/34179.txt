dragen
The Dragen is a race, much like were-dragons, who are split into many expansive tribes. Females are usually lithe, willowy and cold, while males are tall, thick with muscle, and equally as cold. They are highly unaccepting of races other than those who incorporate Shamans, Mystics, or any other people with occupations such as that. The defining traits of a Dragen are these: Their wings. Draconic in appearance, they are usually scaly, smooth and metallic in color. The average wingspan for a female is 50 feet, where for males it is 75 feet. Their tails, usually that of a dragon's, are similar in appearance to the tails, and always the same color as the wings. Sometimes, depending on the tribe and the color, there are ridges or spikes protruding from the flesh. Their most profound ability is to be able to turn into a dragon (western style, thank you) of the color shared by the wings and tail. They can produce flame, fly, maul and any number of things. They are a very formidable opponent. Tribe's usually have an overall demenor, which can be described by the person who uses the race in a roleplaying game or a story.
