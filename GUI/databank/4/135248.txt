University of Minnesota
A huge state University populated by [Minnesotans] and Midwesterners. There are many schools inside this great institution including [Institute of Technology] which is dorky except for the Honors group which drinks. There is also the [Carlson School of Management] which is full of [douchbags]. There is also the [College of Liberal Arts] which focused on history and writing and things like that. It is really cold at the University of Minnesota so bring a jacket. Also there are some really smart people at this school so watch out, they'll set the curve.
