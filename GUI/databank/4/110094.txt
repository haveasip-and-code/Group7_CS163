farmer's kleenex
the act of blowing one's nose without a kleenex. this is typically done one nostril at a time by using the thumb to pinch off one nostril while blowing hard to clear out the opposite nostril. the procedure is then reversed to complete the act. ; this is known, ironically, as the 'farmer's kleenex' because farmers typically don't carry tissues with them in the field, so they just use this 'tissue-less' method instead.
