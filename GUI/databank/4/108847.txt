re animator
Excellent film from director Stuart Gordon, based on the short story 'Herbert West Re-Animator' by H.P. Lovecraft. The film tells the tale of Herbert West (the always underrated Jeffrey Combs, 'The 4400','From Beyond', 'The Frighteners') as a mad scientist with a drug that can bring the dead back to life. Of coarse, things don't exactlly go as planned, and before you know it, you've got tits, gore, a horny severed head, great one-liners, vengeful intestines, zombies, and other things of the sort. What more could you ask for?
