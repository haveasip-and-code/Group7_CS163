Cary High School
The first public high school in north carolina. CHS probably has more traditions and spirit than all neighboring high schools put together. CHS has great soccer, football, and wrestling teams. Which are always a good time to hang out at. And at cary we don't feel the need to deal with freshmen, so they have their own campus up the street. Though the school does have a 7 point grading scale(which sucks cuz that makes 92 a B) and has too many teachers that are homework nazis, in reality the students and the faculty are nice, cool people. If you're looking for a good time CHS parties/games/dances are the place.
