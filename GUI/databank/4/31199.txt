ljstra
ljstra was created march 6th, 2004, in denton texas, when an astronomical experiment failed due to excessive cloud-cover. ; in essence ljstra is an amalgamation of two very capable Halo alter-egos, which, when combined, defy all previously set limits in wheel-of-fortune style gameplay. ; ljstra can often be found frolicking on parkgrounds and college campuses, usually seeking a pond, where he/she will engage in the hunting of turtles. ; those wishing to capture the elusive ljstra are encouraged to use a lure of either poorly secured apostrophe's and/or secluded movie-watching environments.
