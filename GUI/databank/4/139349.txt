scene queen
someone who over does the 'scene' look. this person usual gets a lot of attention from scene guys/girls if they are really skinny and wear super tight pants or short choppy black hair and 7483274 million diffrent eyeshadow colors on there eyes.they get hored up on myspace and are never seen without there scenie queenie crew. they just go to shows to be seen and they usually stand by thr pit evn though though they cant dance, and if they did they would beat up by the tuff bro with the brand new camos on.
