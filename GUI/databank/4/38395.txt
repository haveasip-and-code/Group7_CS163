bogel
A bogel is a Malaysian spambot. ; The spambots appear in irc chatrooms, paste a line of text and then leave. The text is usually in Malaysian and includes a line of text and a link to a webpage supposedly offering porn. The text in their message almost always contains the word 'bogel'. This is where the spambots get their name. ; Anyone who visits their webpage and downloads the .zip file, opens it and clicks on the .exe file inside will get a hidden copy of mirc installed in their system folder which turns them into a spambot without theit knowledge. ; Bogel is also the Malaysian word for 'naked'.
