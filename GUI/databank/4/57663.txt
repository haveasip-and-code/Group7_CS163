The best band in the world
Metallica. The greatest band of all time. Nirvana is close to Metallica, but Metallica is better. (Nirvana rocks, though I like Metallica a little bit better)Metallica consists of James Hetfield, Kirk Hammil, Lars Ulrich, and... it was Cliff Burton, but I forgot the new guy's name. Well, they rock!
