Red sands
red sands is a fucken sick bodyboardin spot on the south coast of nsw, australia. it is a pretty unknown spot.... only locals, pros and hardcore bodyboarders know about it, which is a good thing because if heoasa cunts knew about it it would be fucked coz cunts would come from all over the world to surf it. Some of the barrels ive seen at red sands are so big i swear u could drive a fucken truck straight through and it could backdoor it and make it
