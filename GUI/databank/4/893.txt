airsoft
Game for 12 year olds that buy 11 dollar guns from the Chinese guy at the flea market. The other market is old fat angry men that like giving orders to their squadren members. ; The markers are unnecessarily large and heavy just so they give these 30-year-old kids a feeling of power. ; They would be better off using real guns.
