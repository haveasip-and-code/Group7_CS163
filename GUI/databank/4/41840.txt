Doney
A grimis looking elf that has small hands and small fungi growing feet with nails that could cut a human throat. Has a large passion for soccer and his hair. Jesus himself could say Doney has a unibrow but he wouldn't believe it. He believes strong in family values, such as nurturing for the 13 feline members and the one anteater of the family. Although he looks friendly, keep your distance if he has not had the proper amount of sleep or his sandals have been stolen. Feeds on Coco Puffs, turkey, and Fresca.
