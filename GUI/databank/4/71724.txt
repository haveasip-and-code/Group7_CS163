Puerto Rican Puddle Jumper
A small car usually foreign like a Nissan or Toyota with Pep Boys tinted windows and baby sneakers dangling from the mirror. This vehicle will also be seen sporting chup caps 'plastic fake chrome rims ' with loud Spanish music pumping from a bad Wal Mart style system and a plastic blessed mother on the dash with some rosary beads ( your all ready going to hell, so no holy stuff in yo ride is going to save you). This vehicle can be found in the following parking lots Wal Mart, KMart, your local welfare office, Ron's crack shack in Hammonton,NJ or any supermarket.
