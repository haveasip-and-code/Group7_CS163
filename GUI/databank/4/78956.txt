Tiny Toon Adventures
A show, by Steven Spielberg, that was largely popular in the early 90s. TTA featured witty comedy, pop-culture comedy, and wacky hilarity in a Looney Toons fashion. Memorable characters based on the original Looney Toons, and a host of A-List voice actors were amongst the show's lineup. ; Largely regarded as one of the best cartoons to span the 90s next to 'Animaniacs', 'Ren & Stimpy', and 'Freakazoid', it spanned over roughly 100 episodes, and still has a cult following today. The main characters of the show were Babs & Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, and Hamton Pig. ; One full-length movie, ending the series on a high note, was released. 'Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation' is considered by many to be the end of the series, as the only episodes released after that were specials and reruns. The series is supposed to have a DVD release, according to Warner Home Video. ; The 'Tiny Toon Adventures' theme is by far one of the most popular and memorable TV themes of the 90s. [Arch0wl] even made a Stepmania file to it, where people can step to the arrows of the song. It tanked, however, because it was made very early when he was extremely inexperienced. There have been numerous versions of the theme available for download on the internet, including versions in Japanese and French. ; In all, there were 98 episodes that weren't a special or a movie. ; TTA first aired in Sept 14, 1990, and discontinued it on Feb 12, 1993. The last bit of original TTA material to air was on May 28, 1995.
