Cavalry
Highly ritualized branch of the [Military] that traded in its horses for [HMMWV]s and [helicopters] and its [sabers] for [Anti-Tank Rocket Launcher]s and [Machine Gun]s and have been tear assing around the world ever since. Dating back to the mongol invention of stirrups to allow men to fight from horseback, the cavalry has been and will continue to be the preminent fighting force on the battle field. Their speed, mobility, self-reliance, and combat effectivness has lead to their use as scouts leading every advance and as the rear guard covering every withdrawl. 'First In, Last Out'
