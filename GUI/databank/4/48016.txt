ramboism
Usually found in online games, especially cooperative ones. When some little 11 year old faggot thinks it's another episode of some gay anime show or something, and goes out to be a LONE MERCENARY FAGGOT but ends up getting fucked up when he leaves his group, because the sole purpose of the group was to work together to kill monsters that they couldn't normally kill anyway. People like this usually never learn, because ramboism is usually a cause of impatience. The term derives from Rambo, who was the stereotypical lone badass.
