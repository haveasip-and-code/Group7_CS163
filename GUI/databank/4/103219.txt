oak cliff
a huge neighborghood in dallas that's so rad it just is. ppl who live in the OC are tuff and rock so much they just cant help it cause thats what its all about. there are different parts of OC like North OC, and South OC, that are almost like they're 2 completely different neighborhoods, but they're not. there's an awesome song about it and alot of ppl sing about OC and dont even know what it IS!!
