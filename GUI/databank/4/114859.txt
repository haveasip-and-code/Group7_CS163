Honda
A vehicle manufacturer similar to Toyota, which built reliable vehicles in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, but, like Toyota, has made a few duds in the last few years. They are also convinced that their vehicles can't be broken unless driven and maintained by idiots. ; While a number of Hondas have given the driver years of trouble-free operation, the ones who don't get one are in for a world of pain.
