Sammy Gravano
One of the cruelest mobsters ever. known for his cruel way of killing people. such as when he took a suspected flip, or rat, and took a nail gun to his knee's, what a badass. also in jail now for selling extacy in Arizona. was worth 260 million, now worth....NOTHING! ; got the nickname the bull from the way he fought bigger kidds and won as a kid. also was a flip himself to get a shorter prison sentence.
