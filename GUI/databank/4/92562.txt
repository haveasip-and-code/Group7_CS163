Andrew McMahon
Singer/songwriter/pianist of Something Corporate, and side project Jack's Mannequin. Truly a musical genius, who amazingly incorporates piano(barefoot :])into rock music. His voice is full of emotion, although his appearance is known to be a little nerdy...but totally hot. Andrew has been diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia,is being treated in Los Angeles and his doctors expect a full recovery. GET BETTER! <3
