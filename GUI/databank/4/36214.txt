half
Usually a half ounce of chronic that sells for $150. Sometimes it may be a half pound which usually runs about 1.8 g's. A dealer would usually make fifty bux off the half ounce if he sells it at a fair price, that is 50 an eighth. But if you got no scrilla a half might be a half eighth... haha sux for u
