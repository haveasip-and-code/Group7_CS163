Kahla
Kahla lights up a room when she enters. Every man wants a chance to talk to Kahla, and every woman wants to be her best friend. She wears her heart on her sleeve and always puts others before her own needs. She tries to be everything to everyone, sometimes to a fault. Kahla has a way of opening your heart and placing herself in it for eternity. Once you meet her, you'll never forget her.
