sidwell
IS THAT ALL YOU CAN SAY ABOUT SIDWELL, '4YOURINFO?' first of all, sidwell is a great school. if the only way people can insult us is by our mascot, that is pathetic. we THE BEST academics, great athletics and are a community that cares for each other. we don't try to go and start lame arguments on URBAN DICTIONARY. we are always there for each other and we have the coolest people ever. no one who doesn't go to sidwell can understand how great it is. we are not saying schools like [landon] and [GDS] are bad. what i am saying is, sidwell is a kick-ass, awesome school and anyone in their right mind can see that. THUMB UP!!!!!
