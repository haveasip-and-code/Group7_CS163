Swinging
A lifestyle of non-monogany where sexual relations occur outside the established couple. Swingers tend to refrain from romantic attachments with their outside partners, thus differentiating themselves from [PolyAmorists]. There is some overlap between the two communities, though the closeness of the comparisons are generally not acknowledged.
