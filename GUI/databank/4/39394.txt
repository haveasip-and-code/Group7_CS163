battery acid
Pay no attention to that other definition. The REAL battery acid is a mixture of a sparks energy/alcohol drink with 2-4 shots of your favorite vodka, preferrably a citrus, making one hip drink. The term 'battery' comes from the striking similarity the can has to an energizer battery. Just hook it up and get ready to party.
