Bee Stings
A favoured playground act of torture/violence, where bullies throw small stones at smaller children, usually aimed at soft parts of the body, especially the back, thighs and buttocks. Hugely painful if a handful of stones are thrown in a 'scattergun' fashion. ; The usual response is one where the victim hops or runs off in abject agony. Very nasty.
