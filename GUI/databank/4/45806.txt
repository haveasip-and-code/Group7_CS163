charades
a game where players act out a phrase, movie title, book title, or tv show name. ; Also, the most amusing game to play on extremely long bus rides to and from Florida, preferably when the clues are difficult and require acting out elements of Napolean Dynamite (ex. hash brownies) ; Note, pointing to things outside the bus/things people are doing on the bus or talking ruins the fun of charades.
