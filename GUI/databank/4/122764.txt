zagato
The DB4 GT Zagato is one of the most desirable Aston Martins ever made. Only 75 DB4 GT's were produced, but the Zagato version was even rarer with only 14 being produced from 1961-1963. Differences between the regular DB4 GT and the Zagato include a slight power increase, a smoother and curvier body, and a re-worked front end. ; engine ; Type: Inline-6 ; Displacement: 3670 cc ; Horsepower: 314 bhp @ 6000 rpm ; Torque: 278 lb-ft @ 5400 rpm ; Performance ; 0-60 mph: 6.1 sec ; 0-100 mph: 14.1 sec ; Quarter Mile: 14.5 sec @ 102 mph ; Top Speed: 153 mph
