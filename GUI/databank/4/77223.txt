carpet farting
A carpet farting is where you release a stream of short, fast, bursting farts while you're running or walking. The name is a variant from United States Armed Forces term 'Carpet Bombing'. A carpet bombing is where an aircraft drops a large number of bombs so as to cause a uniform of devastation over a given area. The phrase is probably intended to invoke the image of bombs completely covering an area, like a carpet; carpet farting is basically the same concept.
