Ironman
Originates from Hawaii, the 'hawaii Ironman' is the hardest one there is and qualifying for it can be as difficult as finishing the race itself. ; An 'Iroman' is a triathlon event( see [triathlon])which takes all three disciplines(swimming,biking and running) to extreme levels. The event starts with a 3.8 km swim, then going on to the 180km bike and the marathon(about 43km)run. ; There is no break between these 3 sports which is what makes it so hard. That and the intense distances. There is a time limit for each event. The swimming time limit is about 2 hours and 20 minutes. ; The best usually take about 8 hours to finish an Ironman, the worst will take over 16 hours and some might even have to drop out or risk severe injury and in some cases, death. ; It is hard to get into an 'Ironman' event, and preparing for one can take years depending on the individuel. Those who participate and finish get a t-shirt which they can proudly wear post-race. ; Triathlon and the Ironman are growing in popularity.
