Gerard Arthur Way
Gerard Way is the talented singer of My Chemical Romance. And no, he's not gay. No, he will not have you babies. And it's your opinion if he looks like a freak or not. Personal, he is gorgeous. Not 'Hott', not 'sexay', not 'hAwT'. Just gorgeous. ; Gerard went to an art school in New York City and for a time wanted to be a comic book artist. He made creations like Breakfast Monkey during this time. He hooked up with former drummer Matt Pelliser and basically, that was the start of My Chemical Romance. ; Gerard then wrote his first song 'Skylines and Turnstiles' based on his feelings on September 11th. From then on, it was the road to stardom. ; So that's basically all you need to know. And you tweenie boppers need to stay in the back so the real fans can stay in the front. Don't be pushing your way to the front sreaming about you're pregnant with Gerard's, or Frank's or whoever the fuck you like in that band's baby. Okay? They all have respective girlfriends who they love very much. -nods-
