california dreams
n., the best tv show of all time. 5 seasons, from 1992-1997, about a group of highschool kids who play in a band. they deal with real life issues in between gigs. their music is amazing, and u should buy the cd if its available (there are 2 but 1 of them is hard to find - it's called the Anthology)
