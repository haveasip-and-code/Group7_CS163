Nato
'Nato' is generally a term used when a boy likes partying on a sunday morning as apposed to your usual saturday nights. He is relatively clumsy too - he's the boy who might fall off a balcony for no apparent reason. Nato is derived from the Latin word 'Natogalia' which means 'to bump your head.'
