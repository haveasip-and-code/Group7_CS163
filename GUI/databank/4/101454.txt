Syringer
The unofficial [ATOT] Whipping Boy, constantly ridiculed by forum members for not finishing his infamous [spider] story (see [Syringered]). ; One day, the [AnandTech] forum moderators decided to join in the fun and started giving him custom titles, ranging from Junior Member (used for new members with <25 posts; he has over 8000) to Useless User to a [Cute Little .].
