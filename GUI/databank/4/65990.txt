Fooly Cooly
1) To fondle a woman. Is usually specific to breasts or the ass, but can refer to any part of the body ; 2) An absolutely awesome [anime] also known as [FLCL]. Beleive it or not, Fooly Cooly IS the original name. How it became known as [Furi Kuri] is an interesting fact. ; The way the title was written down was a complicated matter, as the words related more to the symbol and less to the actual word. The closest you could get to writing Fooly Cooly was pronounced Furi Kuri, as 'r' was the closest thing to 'l'. Thus it is only pronounced Furi Kuri when read aloud, though the name is still Fooly Cooly. ; Several people still prefer to call it FLCL. It's about a 12 year old boy, Noata, who has a brother in the U.S., his bro's ex-girlfriend is horny for him, and this crazy Vespa woman who calls herself Haruko slams into his life, and robots start exploding out of his head. Then you throw in guitars, some Christ like robot named Canti, The Pillows, and there you have it; FLCL. ; The show is famously confusing, so to help you out, think of it as an anime Mary Poppins, with randomness and robots.
