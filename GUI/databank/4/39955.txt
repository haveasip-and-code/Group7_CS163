chopping hands motion
Another thing me and Rich came up with aswell as [slammin' doors]. the chopping hands motion is a lesser known replacement for the common 'wanker' sign, and involves moving your hands up and down in a chopping motion when they are about 6 inches apart and fairly parrallel. This came about in a bragging contest about the fashion in which we had to pleasure ourselves because of our over-sized penises.
