wheely wanka
Wheely Wanka is name of a tyre that I one day found in a ditch. This magnificant king of the highway can be rolled down a hill, at high speeds or off a cliff. The Wheely Wanka is a creature of little balance and gets filled with sand easily. It's sister creature is the tyre which can be found on the wheel of a car. The tyre can serve for the same purposes as well as going round and round, round and round all day long.
