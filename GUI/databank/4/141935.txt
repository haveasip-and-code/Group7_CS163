rizzla
1. Noun. (Rizz-luh). A brand of rolling papers found most commonly in Europe, however we have been able to get some silvers in Santa Cruz. They come in a bunch of sizes, but for the most part are more opaque than your average zig zag. Harder to roll with, rizzle's are the true test of a good j-roller. Used primarly for smoking fat spliffs or kingsize L's.
