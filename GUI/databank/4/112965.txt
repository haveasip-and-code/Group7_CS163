Tiara Tuesday
Every Tuesday is Tiara Tuesday. When you're feeling low on Tuesday, all you have to do is take a deep breath and imagine a lovely glittery tiara perched ever so daintily on your precious noggin. Then stand up straight and give the world your best elbow, elbow, wrist, wrist wave and don't forget to touch the pearls, in true Queen Elizabeth fashion!
