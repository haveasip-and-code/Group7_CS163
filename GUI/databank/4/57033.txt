novell
The moron 'skuzzi's defintion says it is an operating system 'noone uses.' No, normal users don't do it, because Novell is a server OS, not an OS for users. It is made to handle network traffic and security. ; Another idiot, 'Cail' states that the user name 'Novell' will get you in to any network...However, the truth is, 'Novell' will only get him in to the network he uses @ his school. The only user name that comes preinstalled is 'admin' which REQUIRES a password. The reason 'Novell' is your login name is because the idiot administrator where you work/go to school has set that to be the username / password with unlimited concurrent connections. (you both are jackasses)
