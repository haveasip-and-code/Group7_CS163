Dr Quinn Internet Medicine Woman
The definition of this 'joke' is still opaque at best. From my understanding, it was a reference BY Lindsay Ann Sherrill ABOUT Lindsay Ann Sherrill. It was made on Valentine's Day 2005 after she pounded not one, not two, but three White Russians. (and by pounded three white russians i dont mean had rough sex with three men from russia)...(or do i???) While she is in nursing school, she is not a doctor. She has been in charge of giving medicine to patients on occasion, which may be where this self-title is rooted. More information will be posted when received
