bite
Used in graffiti, as with the other definitions, it is to steal someones idea/style. Used by true hip-hop loving graffiti heads, the guys that have skill and have the right to critique others work. Not the gangs of filth that spread their messy skribble tags and would die if they ever attempted to design a piece.
