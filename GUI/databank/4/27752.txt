95
The number of theses that Martin Luther posted up on the Wittenburg Church in Europe. This groundbreaking event shattered common belief and the Church's influence. His 95 theses sparked the reformation world wide. This gradually led to the Glorious revolution where Churches had less power, Catholic rule was decreased, and people became literate. Johannes Guttenburg's invention of the printing press helped Martin Luther spread his ideas like a wild fire.
