urinal protocol
The unwritten, unmentioned male code of conduct strictly governing behaviour in a public restroom. ; Urinal protocol dicktates (pardon the pun) that every male must make due effort to accommodate a [buffer urinal] if possible. In situations when a [buffer urinal] is not possible, the pissor must engage in mindless, inane, random conversation with his fellow piss-ees- a phenomenon known as [urinal talk]. The highest rule of urinal protocol governs eye contact. Eyes must remain straight ahead in a zombie-like stare, and finish with only a brief glance downward (at your putz) during the final shake. While a brief glance at the face of a fellow piss-ee is an acceptable part of [urinal talk], a 30 second jaw-agape stare at his dong is un-cool. Similarly, while placing a hand on the wall above the urinal to steady one's self is acceptable (especially when drunk), placing one's hand on another's sholder is not too cool. [Urinal talk] must never lead to the pissor urinating on the shoes of the piss-ee. ; Urinal protocol evolved as a means to deal with [urinal anxiety] (also referred to as being [pee shy]) and it's corresponding eccentric behaviour. Restroom owners may erect (pardon the pun) a [shame shield] as a method of dealing with [urinal anxiety] and encourage compliance with the time-tested 'urinal protocol'.
