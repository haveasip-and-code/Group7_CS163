Coco a.k.a. Kathie Schmid
In another pathetic and feeble attempt to get attention, Coco would go on and on about how 'busy' and 'stressed' she is. First, the bitch does not work. Second, the mongoloid slept well into the afternoon. Third, the wife of Bob (see 'stinky finger') would be the first person to cry for help and the last person to provide it.
