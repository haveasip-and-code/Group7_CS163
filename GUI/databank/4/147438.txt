Groovy
First of all i would like to point out that anyone who says that groovy is old and uncool is completely wrong they are the people who stopped using the word groovy because they were not groovy themselves and still arent!!. Groovy is a wrongly unused and seemingly uncool word which is infact the best word in the history of the whole world ever!! the word groovy describes something cool, great, amazing and basically anything good... it needs a revival people!!dont listen to those assholes who tell you what to say!! use the word groovy!!get groovy!!
