idst
If Destroyed, Stays True. ; Put on the end of messages by immature schoolchildren so that if a message is destroyed, it's appatrently still true- regardless of wether or not it was true in the first place. ; Can easily be counteracted by destroying the IDST first, removing it's protection, then removing said message.
