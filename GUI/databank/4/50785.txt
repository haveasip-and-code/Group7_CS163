Blue Oyster Cult
Excellent New York rock band who have created awesome albums like 'Agents Of Fortune', 'Fire Of Unknown Origin' and many others. Lead guitar player is the awesome Buck Dharma. Sometimes called the 'thinking man's heavy metal band' which I personally think is a bullshit title, as it misrepresents both heavy metal fans, and heavy metal music. Most good heavy metal/hard rock bands create 'intelligent' music (early Judas Priest, Black Sabbath etc, and no, I dont consider 80's 'hair' metal bands to be representative of what metal stands for). Awesome band nonetheless, and if you dont know they're music, check them out. Listen with an open mind
