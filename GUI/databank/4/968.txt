townie
Townies are scruffy bastards normally aged under 18 year old who speak as common as muck. ; They most commonly come from council estates by drug addict parents, they hang around in bus shelters, outside of chipshops, near Spar, street corners, or MacDonalds. ; They basically sit in a bus shelter, bandstand, etc, smoke blow, ciggies, drink horrible booze such as cider, white lightning or 'lightnin' as they call it. ; They will wait for someone normal to walk past before one asks, 'Av ya gorra lighter?', if you say no, they will follow you calling you 'goff' or 'mosha' or other stupid stuff. They may call you something and if you call them something back, you will likely get stalked, chased or beat up. They sometimes just follow you anyway, trying to intimidate people. They sometimes simply mug people, beat random people up, happy slap, sit on someones wall trying to cause trouble, smash car windows, piss on peoples fences, you get the picture, just pointless stuff. ; They only hang round in groups, if you actually get one on their own they act like wimps, or say, 'Am gonna ring ma bruv up to come and batter' you like'. The girls are sometimes pregnant, they wear trainers, tracksuits (trackies), puffer jackets, hoodies, anything that looks crap. ; They are scum, total douchebags
