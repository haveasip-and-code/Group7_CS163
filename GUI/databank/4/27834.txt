Apple Computers
A wonderful company that sells amazing products like Macs, iPods, and software. Products sold from Apple Computers are almost always stunning, fast, powerful, and rarely crash or cause other problems. Apple's main product, the Macintosh computer, is argueably the best computer in the world (specifically the G5). It runs on OS X, but is highly compatable, too. It is also equipped with a UNIX core, accessable through the Terminal. Basically it totally kicks microsoft's pathetic butt.
