THOUSAND YEARS OF PAIN
A faux jutsu used by Kakashi-sensei in the anime Naruto. The technique basically consists of the user sneaking behind the anime, sticking his/her index fingers into the enemy's anus and thrusting the enemy into the air, hence a thousand years of pain. ; Naruto later customizes this technique. Instead of thrusting the enemy into the air, Naruto leaves a firebomb in the enemy's anus.
