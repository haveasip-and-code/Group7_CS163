one inch punch
The famous 'special move' of the late [Bruce Lee], based on a technique known in kung fu as 'fa jing', which can be described with the following example: you know that when you try to get a tree out of a garden or a nail out of a piece of wood, you tend to jerk at it repeatedly, rather than pull continuously? It's sort of like that: by moving a part of his body with a quick jerk, rather than a constant force, Bruce Lee (and probably quite a few skilled kung fu practicioners) was able to release a large force from a seemingly short distance.
