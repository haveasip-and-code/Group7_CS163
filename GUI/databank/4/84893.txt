anarchopunk
a strain of punk rock concerned with abolishing the state and capitalism. often concerned with animal liberation and radical environmentalism. some bands may be against civilization (domestication), a relatively new tendency within the anarchist mileu. ; this subculture/ subgenre is generally agreed to have been started by the british punk band crass. ; songs will the decry the ravages of war, police brutality, animal testing and meat-eating, etc. the songs are usually about things anarchists don't like, and express exactly how much they don't like them. ; anarchist punks tend to wear a lot of black. crass started wearing all black at shows as a reaction to punk fashion. most kids don't have that reason anymore. reasons will be as varied as the individuals asked. ; record covers will invariably be black and white, with black forming the negative space/ background. imagery of dead bodies and war scenes are common among certain strains of anarchopunk, especially those which emulate the older bands. ; bands will often use stencil font or a font utilizing scratchy, goopy-looking letters., and these logos will be seen adorning the pants, vests, jackets, etc. of punks, usually printed with white ink on black canvas. patches will be sewn on with dental floss. it's really strong and looks cool. ; the variations on the anarchist punk are many, and new strains are constantly being formulated. ; peace-punk (as in crass, contravene), ; d-beat crust (named after the band discharge, who arguably were the first to use this beat.. some say it was mob 47), folk-punk (often poppy, as in against me!, or defiance ohio), and anarchist-punk takes on grindcore and metal are just a few.
