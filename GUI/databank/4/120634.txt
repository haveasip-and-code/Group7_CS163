QLR
Queen's Lancashire Regiment: Regiment of the British Army. It recruits around the area Lancashire and is infamous for scandalous shannanigans during the Iraq war. There are two QLR detachments in Merseyside ACF, sometimes referred to as the Queers Lesbians and Rapists, who to this day persist in being hated, mainly for being dirty wools ([woolyback]s) from St. Helens where everyone is family (dirty in-breds).
