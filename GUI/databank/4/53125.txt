Academic Decathlon
founded in the sixties by some guy from orange co. California. ; Where a group of nine kids get together and study for a year on a designated topic (i.e. ancient civlizations) in hope to master 10 different skill areas. Incredibly hard competition at the national level and most likely california will win. ; a joke is some states, and serious business in others. ; a safe haven for the incredibly nerdy or naturally brilliant.
