Sports
Ummm... why do folks think all athletes are stupid? Leonardo DaVinci was said to be an outstanding athlete. He was also considered the protoypical 'Renaissance Man'. So, all those people who consider themselves 'Renaisance Men' (or women of course) and are weak at sports are, in fact, ... just plain weak.
