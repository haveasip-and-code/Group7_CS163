This is the layout on modern computer keyboards. This came about because on typewriters, using the alphabetical method, meant that the most commonly used keys were next to each other, and got stuck a lot. The new keyboard method came about because some bright spark placed all the most common keys apart from each other, and the qwerty keyboard has stayed with us forever! :-)
