Website Tagging
On the 19th april of 2005, Tim Williams, Gemoman, Gemo, Tim or Timmy, was talking with me on MSN messenger, and out of extreme boredom, came up with what has come to be known as 'website tagging'. ; The concept is simple. You take a screenshot of a website, and write something on it - your name - that the website sucks - That a horse took a shit on it -- Anything. Once this is finished, you illegaly own the website. ; See the image section for examples. ; Let it be known that this trend was started by none other than Gemo.
