OceanCity
Ocean City -- known for the best senior week parties for us in maryland...not a beach week or a 3month party like those jersey people have after graduation....its where all the beer is flowing in front of your face, the beach is right at your fingertips, and most of the people down there that have houses are spending as they say 'daddys money'...that is what high schoolers look forward too and what we college people will go to after high school cause we know how bangin it is down there....and no its not like the ocean city in jersey, cause up there in the 'stepford' like town, us down here at ocean city, md have just as much money but know how to have a much better time.....
