7th Heaven
TV show that you either love or hate. The most common reasons it is watched are for family morals/values, because Barry Watson, David Gallagher, and/or George Stults are 'hot', because some comfort is found in watching the show, or for snark value. ; The show is extremely highly rated, so it's obvious not that bad and has a good basic idea behind it.
