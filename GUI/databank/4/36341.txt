Yorkshire
Yorkshire is Englands Largest County, habitat of a truly great breed of peoples, the yorkshire men. But alas the end is nigh for these peoples as they succumb to the grasping fingers of the big city corporations which seek to turn their flatcaps to NY baseball caps, their pint of bitter to a bottle of smirnof ice and generally give the place a good 'chaving' up. I fear in 50 years the sight of the true yorkshire men quaffing beer after a hard games cricket or a quick sweat down some or other coal mine will be no more. And we'll look like every other sod in sodding britain.
