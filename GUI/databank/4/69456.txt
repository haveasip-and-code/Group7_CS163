Vaughn Allen
This is the original writer of the number one hit single Black Tee. Once while he was chillin on the corner of Tron some crazy mofos tried to rob him of the brick he was holdin. But he handled that real quick, he pulled out his AK-47 with his 2-11 and fucked-them-up! Instead of bullets he had ammunition of chess pieces. Everytime he kills he leaves a sticker on their bodies that says 'CHECKMATE!' Don't mess with him!
