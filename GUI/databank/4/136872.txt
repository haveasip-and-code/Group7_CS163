FTTYYGTS
FTTYYGTS; Farts That Tell You You Got To Shit. Usually Pronounced as Fitty-Gits. Passing gas with a very bad odor that makes you aware you will soon need to move your bowels. Originally only used in written correspondence, as it is cumbersome to speak each letter, it has recently come into use in the spoken word with the more recent advent of the pronunciation, 'Fitty-Gits.'
