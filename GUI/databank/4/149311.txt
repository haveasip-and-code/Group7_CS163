Pat Buchanan
Politician, who wrote speeches for Nixon, Ford and Reagan. Some people would say he's a diehard conservative. He would say he's a traditional conservative. He thinks that the GOP has shifted from its original values. Had the nerve to quit the party. Doing this, he knew he would never have any chance to win a Presidential election.
