casino air
Term based on the myth that Vegas hotels pump extra oxygen into their casinos to keep people awake, boost alcohol's effects, etc. etc. This is false, and would be highly illegal if true. Not to mention what would happen if someone lit a cigarette. ; The 'rush' that many people feel when entering a casino is really a combination of overstimulation (flashing lights, noise, excitement) and sudden exposure to lower temperatures; though they aren't allowed to pump oxygen in, some casinos keep temperatures lower than normal to help keep people awake and alert, spending more money rather than returning to their rooms. ; Although it's based on false information, the term is not obsolete; it can also refer to the casino's atmosphere of excitement and risk.
