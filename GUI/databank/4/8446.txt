pwnd
A gamer/hacker term, usually used when playing a game/hacking; meaning 'ownd' or 'owned'. The reason a 'P' is used instead of an 'O' is because the 'P' represents a flag pole with a flag (flag pole with a flag represents owned, such as the american flag on the moon representing america landed there first).
