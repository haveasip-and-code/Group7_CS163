wallball
Arguably the most effective training drill in the sport of [lacrosse]. One simply throws the ball against a wall 8 to 10 feet high and catches it back, cradling the ball. Rinse and repeat. Spice it up a little with things like: behind the back, switching hands, running around while throwing, etc.
