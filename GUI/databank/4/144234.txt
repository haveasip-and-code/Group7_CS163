CC Attack
The passive aggressive practice of sending an e-mail showing the target recipient (usually of lower status in the hierarchy) how foolish they are and then using the cc line to include as many people as possible (who have previously not been involved in the e-mail conversation) to further the humiliation as widely as possible. Commonly used in the business world.
