chillum
The chillum is a narrow funnel originally shaped out of fired clay. Chillums were thought to have originated in India or South America. Chillums were orginally used in a spiritual manor by Hindu priests. Today they are used by stoners everywhere. Inside the chillum is filter stone to prevent the weed (or whatever it is that your smoking) from falling into your mouth. Today, some chillums come with an attachment at the top that can hold a lighter. This attachment makes it possible to just hold the chillum from the lighter, light and go! Smaller chillums bring hot smoke directly into your lungs. The larger the chillum, the colder the smoke and the more you get in your lungs.
