urbandictionary.com wall
A place where people like to make as vulgar comments as possible, post their telephone numbers inviting people to have hot monkey buttsex with them, swear a lot, say random stuff, whine about how shitty their lives are, make fun of the US, and generally say whatever the hell they want without fear of repercussions. A general waste of time and a perfect glimpse into how stupid and offensive people can be when they're anonymous and can say whatever shit they want without their identities being found out.
