Albedo
Albedo is an artificial construct referred to as a U.R.T.V. He possesses incredible otherworldly powers that allow him to actually regrow severed limbs, up to and including his head. Albedo seems to be working for the U-TIC Organization, but it's more likely that he has his own agenda. ; Albedo has descended so far into madness that he can no longer even be described as human. He shares deep familial roots with both Gaignun Kukai (Nigredo) and Jr. (Rubedo). Sick and twisted beyond belief, Albedo is the main antagonist in Monolith Soft's famed Xenosaga series.
