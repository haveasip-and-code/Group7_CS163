National Novel Writing Month: A contest in which contestants try to write a novel of at least 50,000 words in the month of Novermber. ; -It's not really a contest. It's a lot of fun, and the reward is a nifty little winner picture and the satisfaction of knowing you've created, at least some, Good Art. ; -As many people who can win are official winners. Wordcounts are validated by the Nanowrimo website. ; -It's only called National because that sounds spiffy. People from all around the world participate every year. ; -Nanowrimo creates a deadline and in this way forces people to write books that they never would have had the initiative to write themselves.
