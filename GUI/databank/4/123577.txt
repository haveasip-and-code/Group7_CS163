Kreyol
Haitian Creole. A vulgar language with French origins. ; Kreyol is often and incorrectly thought to be a mere dialect of French, but it is a language in its own right, springing from African tongues under French slavery and occupation. It is both spoken and written and had a distinct phonetical and grammatical system. ; While Kreyol may not be the 'official' language of Haiti, it is spoken by the vast majority of Haitians (roughly 8 million) and all of Haiti's large illiterate population.
