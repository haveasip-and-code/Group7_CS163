Boyiee
A [slang] word often used in a joking manner, or by (don't get offended by this people) black women who think they're rappers. In a joking manner, it just can be used in random sentences to add flavor, inslut, or fun. In a rapping manner, it means 'boy' or some other [shit] I don't understand.
