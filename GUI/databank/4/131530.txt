harriet miers
Nominee for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Previously served as White House Counsel to the President. Her nomination has come under fire because of a lack of experience and what some Republicans feel is a lack of conservative credentials. She is a born-again, sexually inactive 60 year old woman who looks like Jerri Blank from Strangers with Candy.
