Hockessin
Hockessin, true we don't have any true gangstas, but we're still better than those poor wiggers in North Wilmington Joe... A.I. DuPont blows, so does Sanford, McKean, Dickinson, and every other public high school anywhere near there. Yeah so what we hang out at Wawa? We know a good thing when we see one. Not to mention we have 2 Cousin's with the best pizza, hottest girls, and coolest guys ever working there. Yeah and Woodside's ice cream is almost better than sex... Hokie, WHAT!!
