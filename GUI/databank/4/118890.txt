Polishing The Pewter
Another one of the countless names for masturbating. Derived from the movie 'Almost Heroes' staring Chris Farley (RIP), in which him Matthew Perry portary Lewis and Clark. However, one should note that in the movie the phrase is not used to describe masturbation, but the various acts of sex. Over time the phrase has changed meaning.
