Blockbuster
A shitty wanna-be company that will/should either end up unionized or flat broke. Cheating people outta money is the game, treating employees like shit is a bonus. Managerial skills take backburner to sales. They actually had the balls to say late fees dont make up much of their profits. Ya, ok shitbrick.
