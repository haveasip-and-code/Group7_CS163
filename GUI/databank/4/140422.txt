rig
n. the proper slang term for an ambulance. people often use the word 'bus' instead of 'rig' but they are usually the ones that want to be cops or want to sound like FDNY EMS when in fact it just makes them sound like incompetant assholes. a bus is something that catches fire on the side of route 42 in jersey.
