Peep Show
A great new British TV comedy show, which started on Channel 4 in 2003. It is nothing like the BBC show The Office because it's not in anyway done like a documentary. The show is more similar to Sean Lock's 15 Stories High - but alot of the show is seen through the eyes of the main two characters who share a flat together.
