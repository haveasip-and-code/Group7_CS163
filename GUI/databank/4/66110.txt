overlord
Normally a master race of giant space ants that like to 'conquer' spacecrafts. It's difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they normally consume the planet captives or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants can soon be here. ; I'd like to remind them that as a trusted [Urban Dictionary] contributor I could be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves.
