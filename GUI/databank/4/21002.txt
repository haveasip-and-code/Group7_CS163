kant
A german philosopher from the 1700s, Immanuel Kant pontificated at length about what people should do. Manny derived the law of universalizability, which states if something can be applied universally, it must be good. Manny also claimed that we can never know the true motivations of our actions, which only muddles ethical theory and provides an excuse for unethical conduct.
