Awesome japanase light sportscar. The older rear wheel drive models where the better ones, especially the third generation, in particular the RA65. With it's 2.4L EFI engine, power steering and hardcore rear wheel drive handling it is a drift machine. The RA65's W55 supra 5 speed gearbox is well geared with a grunty tall second gear and has ultra quick gear changes. The W55 is also very strong and can take hard downchanges. Sexy angular shape, pop up lights and chick pulling power it is one seriously cool car that is known everywhere.
