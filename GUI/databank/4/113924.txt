Emo kids
Sad creatures of the dark. These kids hate sun light and for them it's illegal to be happy or ever smile. They are usually seen wearing clothing of their favorite bands (lots of black) and will most likely have dyed hair (mainly black or sometimes colorful streaks). They're mainly found in groups of other emo kids writing music, lyrics, or poems about their sad lives that they can't go on living.
