Force
1. A physical exertion on something. ; 2. The living field of energy, from Star Wars. Some people are stronger in it than others, mainly Jedi or Sith. The Sith are better. (Don't ask me how midi-chlorians come into this, at all.) ; 3. What I usually have to do in order to get the shit out of my ass.
