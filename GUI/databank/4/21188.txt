wedlock
Wedlock is not the 'art of bastard breeding,' nor is it 'illegitamate children,' (sic) nor is it 'the act of having children before marriage.' ; Wedlock is the state of being married, or it can mean matrimony. ; Wedlock should not be confused with the phrase 'out of wedlock' which means that something has taken place or one or more people are out of the state of being married (read: unwed).
