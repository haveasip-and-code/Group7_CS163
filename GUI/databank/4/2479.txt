Panzer
German for tank, and short for Panzerkampfwagen. German for armored combat vehicle. The word Panzer is used widely to refer to the many German tanks in [World War II], with a total of 6 operational variants, Panzerkampfwagen I-VI. They were the Panzer I(light tank armed with 2 7.92mm MG), Panzer II(light tank, armed with 1 7.92 MG and 1 20mm cannon), Panzer III(light-medium tank, armed with 37mm cannon, 2 7.92mm MG), PAnzer IV (medium battle tank, armed with 75mm short barreled, 2 7.92 MG, later versions armed with long barrel 75mm cannon), Panzer V (aka Panther, armed with high-velocity 75mm, 2 7.92mm MG, considered to be one of the greatest engineering marvels of the war), Panzer VI (aka Tiger, armed with 88mm cannon, 2 7.92 MG, considered to be one of the most powerful tanks of the war; many tank crews often avoided engaging Tigers in the open, this was called 'Tigerphobia'), and the Panzer Tiger II Konigstiger (aka King Tiger). These were Germany's main battle tanks from 1939-1945. However, the Panzers weren't limited to tank warfare; other variants came about, such as the Wespe(mobile artillery built on the Panzer II Chassis), Bison I(built on the Panzer I chassis, mobile artillery), Panzer Wirbelwind (mobile anti-aircraft gun build on Panzer IV chassis), Nashorn (mobile anti-tank gun built on Panzer IV chassis), Marder I, II, III (mobile anti-tank guns built on Panzer I, II, and III chassis), and the Sturmgeschutz III(an assault gun/anti-tank gun built on Panzer III chassis). ; That being said, Panzers were very reliable tanks, powerful, and deadly. They almost always strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.
