The Ultimate Fighter
Awesome T.V. show that airs Monday nights 11:00PM Eastern time on Spike TV. I highly suggest you watch the show. ; The show also airs Saturday nights at 10:00PM Eastern time. ; 16 guys all want to become a UFC fighter and get a UFC contract, each week two guys fight. The loser gets sent home, if they get knocked out; the winner gets 5 grand cash in their pocket.
