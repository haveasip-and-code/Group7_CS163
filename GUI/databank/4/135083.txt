mother-in-law
A woman who bears children who one day wed, will find herself at the wedding day changed into a mother-in-law. This demotion of status as the previous Number One female in her children's world can create horrible changes in what was once a lovely woman. Most of the bad scenarios arise from a jealousy between wives and mother-in-laws, although there have been some husbands who have faced the wrath of a mother-in-law. A mother-in-law is generally seen as a mythically bad person. As a parallel, father-in-laws don't get the same bad rap.
