Sidharth
1) Sid-arth ; [yawesome], crazy-tall Indian dude who is quite possibly a product of my imagination/schizophrenia. If he's not doing something art or music related he's either being obnoxious, looking for the 'better katie,' procrastinating, watching videos on Launch, or looking up webcomics on my laptop when I'm trying desperately to do school work. I'm kinda glad we seem to be stuck on the same brain-wave, but sometimes it's just a little creepy. ; 2) sid-Harth ; The being that takes over normal Sidharth when he's exposed to an addictive video game. ; 3) sid-(leans forward)-Harth ; Just pretend the H isn't there Mrs. Brady. (I mean, technically it isn't. He added it so he can never graduate from high school and take spanish over and over again....)
