QuakeCon
The largest LAN party.. ever. 2005 marked QuakeCons 10th annual celebration of everything gaming. It hosted up to 4000 computers, and plenty more people just showing up off the street. 2004 and 2005 were held at the Gaylord Resort in Grapevine, TX. Every year they get a bigger budget, and better swag (free stuff). If you get the chance, go, you won't be displeased. Also, bottles of Bawls are passed out like candy, and are used to supplement the 3 hours of sleep each night that the average person gets. QuakeCon is a celebration of all things gaming, but by tradition and name, is really a hail to FPS games, especially games in the Quake series.
