Titty Movie
A term given to any 1980s-style mindless formula sex comedy, primarily marketed to teens, which included several scenes of gratuitous female topless nudity. (Today, sadly, a dying genre.) ; Examples are too numerous to give here, but these are the movies that in VHS days suffered extreme wear and tear from excessive pausing and frame advancing on the above referenced titty scenes.
