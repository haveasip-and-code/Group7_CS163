tubbs
when a statement is made, it is someone who replies to the statement with some kind of idiotic phrase that is just a bunch of jumbled nothingness and should have not been stated at all, and after the 'tubbs' does this you are to yell at him/ or her and tell them how idiotic they are and tell them to shut up, possibly even punch them. ; Someone can also be called a tubbs if they have a goat. in that case u just touch the goat and make fun of him saying he hates it. ; Another definition for a tubbs is someone who has not yet learned to talk to the opposite sex, so you make fun of them and tell them they talk a lot and they know what they are doing.
