Beaner
Beaner is often mistaken for a 'lazy' mexican border-hopping spic. ; Thats not the case. You cant honestly call beaners 'lazy' ; They work on roofs from like 6AM til until dark....They work on yard's all day long....and will usually cover about a 55 mile radius of yards in that period of time. ; They work on cars....and good at it.....REAL good at it.... ; They're not lazy.....but they are border-hopping spics.
