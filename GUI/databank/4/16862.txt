spanky
Oddly this word has two meanings which are almost polar opposites: (i) An object, product or district which is undesirable because of its poor quality construction, poor stylistic taste, dilapidation etc. (ii) An object, product or district which is desirable and trendy, usually in an offbeat or gimmicky way.
