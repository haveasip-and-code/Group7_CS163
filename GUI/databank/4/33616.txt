rock and roll
A term used to describe the new emergence of rhythm and blues fusion type music in the 1950's. Often the music is referred to simply as rock in modern times. 'Rock and rolling' originally was a term frequently used in predominantly black neighborhoods to mean 'having sexual intercourse'. The term was however first derived as a musical term by disk jockey Alan Freed. Alan Freed first played a collection of rhythm and blues albums in his show under the name 'The Moondog Show'. However, upon relocating to New York he changed the name to 'The Rock and Roll Show'. He had full knowledge of the term and it's racy implications, but probably found great satisfaction in the spread of the term among mainstream America with little knowledge of the term's true meaning.
