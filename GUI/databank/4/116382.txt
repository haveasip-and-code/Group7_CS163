Sedentaryville  CA
Also known as southern California. We sit in our cars for hours on end, day in and day out. We are commuters. We have no choice. Our cities are not compact like New York. We are spread out with no public transportation to make the connections. We drive 50 miles or more a day just to get back and forth to work! Throw in the traffic factor and we're talking 8 to 10 hours a week sitting in a car.
