Chav Hunting
A game with rapidly increasing popularity in towns and cities all over Britain. The idea is to amass a gang of your own peers and take out as many chavs (see [chav]) as possible. The connoisseurs of this sport are pushing to make this sort of pursuit legal, and have achieved some success at local election level in many Northern English towns (see [blackpool],[bradford],[burnley],[york] etc) and are vowing to make it a parliamentary and general election issue very soon. As soon as this sport is legalised we can kill the chavs, and save the world! ; (see also [euthanasia],[mercy killing],[extermination],[pest control] etc)
