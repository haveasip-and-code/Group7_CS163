DFF
An acronym for Dumb Fat Fuck. This acronym is normally used to describe someone who acts in an unintelligent and dim-witted manner. It is one who should have been fired a long time ago, but still works at the company because he knows someone high up in the ladder or is having sex with one of the bosses.
