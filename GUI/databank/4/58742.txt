Bill Brasky
A character on SNL during the early ninties that seems to have quite a Legend. Participants in the sketch usually consist of Alec Baldwin, Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell. ; The skit takes place in a bar/a funeral/etc where we find three or four drunk guys (known now as the 'Brasky Bunch') yelling and screaming about all the times they've had with Bill Brasky
