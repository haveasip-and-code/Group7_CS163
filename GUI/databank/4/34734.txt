Lenielle
The product of a noted evolutionary conglomoration of three beings into one due mostly to excessive co-dependence and poorly executed CRT(read: College to Reality Transition). Lenielle is not a fictional character but can actually be spotted out in the wild, usually, however, in bars, on the weekends. The breakdown is as follows; Lori (L) Jennifer (en) Danielle (ielle) and one must take note that when refering to only one-third of 'Lenielle' that particular third must be verbally emphasized.
