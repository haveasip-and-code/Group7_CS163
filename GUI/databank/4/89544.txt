Love Muppet
A muppet in love. Most commonly used with reference to a member of the male gender. Describes a guy who has become entirely wrapped around a girl's finger in serf-like fashion, and as a result displays pathetic, incoherent, twat-like behaviour in all other areas of his puppeteered existence...and yet is regrettably oblivious to the fact.
