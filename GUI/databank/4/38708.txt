lane drifting
On a multi-lane road (usually a highway or mainstreet), lane drifting is when a car suddenly begins 'drifting' over the lanes, usually because the driver isn't paying attention, or cannot see the lanes because they aren't painted well enough. ; Usually they'll hover between two lanes, going the speed limit, and holding up traffic in both lanes.
