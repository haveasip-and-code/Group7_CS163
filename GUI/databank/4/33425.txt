spudnik
A series of Russian artificial potatots sent into orbit during the late 1950s. Literally 'yellow yam' in Russian. Spudnik I made history on October 4, 1957, by becoming the first man-grown object put into orbit in a mashed state. Spudnik II would follow later, this time carrying sour cream, the first prepared food in space.
