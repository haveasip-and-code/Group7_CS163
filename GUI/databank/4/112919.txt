Porsche 924s
Classic Porsche that evolved into the 944. The 924s came with the same exact engine as a 944, and the same transmission. only difference is the 944 is more heavier because of a wider body. 924s would win in a race tho. very quick off the line. Only thing that sucks about it, is that you have to take like 2 things apart on the engine just to get to 1 thing.
