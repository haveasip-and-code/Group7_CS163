fluffy cup
(noun) A cavity found in female humans running from the [vulva] (open end) to the [cervix] (closed end). The cup is scientifically termed the [vagina], affectionately termed the [pussy] or [honey pot], spiritually referred to as the [yoni] by followers of the [Aryan] tradition, but disrespectfully known as the [cunt]! Fluff is the term used to refer to the [pubic] hair that naturally grows around vulva. In ancient times all adult cups were fluffy, with the exception of those of individuals suffering from a condition called [alopecia], but today due to the [playboy] wax job, the term is no longer universally applicable. Today's preferred configuration is the [Brazilian].
