snowploughed
The process whereby one's own plans are shunted aside to make way for what someone else wants to do. The offender's act(s) can often go unnoticed, and 'snowploughed' can be uttered (most commonly as an interjection) to make them (and anyone else around who will listen) realise just how appalling their selfishness really is.
