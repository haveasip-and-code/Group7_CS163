dharna
An Indian protest tactic which involves a combined sit-in and fast or hunger-strike (usually not ongoing, and sometimes carried out on a rotating basis). Participants in a dharna sit down in a strategic location, either inside a target building or area (thus amounting to an occupation), or outside some such target, and fast, usually while also chanting and holding placards.
