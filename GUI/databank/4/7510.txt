public defenestration
A fairly adaptive solution for many of society's problems. Consists of turning an otherwise mundane [defenestration] into a public spectacle, visible to all. Great for cowing the masses back into line with the fear of being tossed out a really high window. ; Emperor Cuzco was particularly famous for employing this technique.
