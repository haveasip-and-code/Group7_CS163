mud butt
(muhdh - buht) n. med. (usu. pre. by 'the') Mud Butt is a common affliction of the anus and the glutteal crevice, affecting mainly (but not limited to) 'heavies'. The condition usually occurs 30 to 45 minutes after defecation, especially if sufferer engages in physical activity within this time. Sweat and some remaining feces (though one's wiping habits may be immactulate) mix in the glutteal crevice, causing mild discomfort and, if not treated, a raw ass.
