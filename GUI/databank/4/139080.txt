slap-happy
adj. (1) this word describes the state of someone who becomes somewhat giddy or abnormal in behavior as a result of being smacked around. It is thus synonymous with [punch drunk]. ; (2) it has also been used to describe a person with a penchant or delight in hitting others, but this is certainly not a noun that refers to the state of happiness produced by the hitting.
