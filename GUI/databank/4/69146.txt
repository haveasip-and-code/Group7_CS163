alchemy
The Hermetic science and art of causing change, both physically and spiritually. The term is also used to describe the spiritual practices of chemists from other ancient cultures, such as ancient Chinese 'alchemists.' In the old days, there was no division seen between spiritual and physical practices, but for the sake of modern obsession with duality, alchemy can be divided into two types. ; Practical alchemy _is_ chemisty, studying and manipulating the properties of matter to get what you want out of the universe. ; Spiritual alchemy is what is discussed when 'turning base metals into gold' is described. It is a form of mysticism, spiritual self-improvement with analogies to chemical jargon. 'Gold' is spiritual perfection, while the lesser 'base' metals (such as lead) are impure states of the spirit, unenlightened and full of the problems of mortal life. ; Knowledgable alchemists were never trying to make a potion for eternal life or a stone that would transform physical materials into gold.
