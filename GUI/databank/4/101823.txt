Le Mans
The famous 24 hour race, a gruelling test of man and machine. A race so long that 23 hours can go right but in the end you still might not survive. Taking place at the Cirque De La Sarthe in France this race has been considered the most prestigious form of racing in the world for manufacturers. Le Mans stands next to Formula 1 and the World Rally Championship in europe for history and just as Rallying is unique for the different distances and terrains and Formula 1 is unique for its driver skill and technology Le Mans is known for its long distances and great engineering.
