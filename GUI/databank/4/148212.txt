The Figel Option
A term used in beer pong that replaces a team mate for usually just a throw. The replacement can be anyone near the table choosen by the single player. This term is put in effect if the missing team mate taken a piss, droppin a deuce, or just unavalible at the time of his throw. This keeps the game flowing.
