Shit-Box (X-Box)
A term used by avid gamers of opposing gaming consoles to insult the X-Box. While the long-believed rumours of the X-Box being more powerful than the PS2 have been scientifically proven wrong, the console still has a wide variety of games, including the extremely popular 'Halo' franchise, that launched the console into its success. It is designed by Microsoft, and will be replaced by the Xbox 360 which will be released November 2nd, 2005. ; The interior of the Xbox is a Celeron CPU running at 700 Mhrz. It also contains a small harddrive which is more than sufficient for storing saved games and other media such as music, rather than using memory cards. Its graphics processor was custom designed by the Canadian company ATI.
