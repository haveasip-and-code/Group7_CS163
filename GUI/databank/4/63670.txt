Taito
'Taito' - TaichixYamato : Very popular Boy's Love (Yaoi) relationship in Digimon. ; Also, 'Taito' shows the readers which boy takes on the more 'dominant' role('Seme') and which one takes on the more 'submissive' role ('Uke'), in this case: Taichi - Seme; Yamato - Uke. ; If the roles were reversed, the pairing would not be called 'Taito', rather it would be called [Yamachi].
