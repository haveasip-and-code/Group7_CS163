bite the kerb
Said in situations when you want someone to die, when approached by a mugger or someone who wants to steal something from a human, you say 'bite the kerb', in the style of American History X. When you feel the rage you get when someone tries to steal something from someone who worked for money, then all you want to do is either kill the bastard or wound him very much.
