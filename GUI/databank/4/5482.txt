Hockey
1) A sport originating in [England], not played on ice but on foot, not using a puck but a [ball]. After hockey had developed in the British Isles in the late 19th century, it spread throughout the British [Empire], largely due to the British army and this is one reason why India, Pakistan and Australia are so formidable (all were British colonies). Today, hockey is played all over the world by a variety of countries and is currently the second largest team sport in the world, just behind [football] (that's soccer to those who didn't realise). ; 2) A faster way of saying [ice hockey]. ; Note - Both are good sports that need [speed], [stamina], [skill] etc, I'm just clearing up that it is seldom recognised that field hockey was the original.
