gorham  maine
The best town in the world!! We have our own pizza shop, coffee shop, and black market hand bag shop. Everyone wishes the lived here. ; The upper part(north gorham) is called the Sticks. People from the Sticks like to think they are their own little town. They are wrong. They are Gorhamites just like the rest of us. ; Kids from Gorham like to hang out behind Shop n' Save and in the woods. But if you are really cool, you can hang IN Shop n' Save. ; Adults from Gorham usually spend their time in Portland, so basically nobody with a drivers liscence wants to hang here. ; If you were raised in Gorham, then go to USM, you automatically become a Townie.
