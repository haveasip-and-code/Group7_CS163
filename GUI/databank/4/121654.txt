Miscegenation
The term white supremacists for race mixing. Miscegenation is based on a misunderstanding of genetics; that the superficial differences between various human social groups actually means something on a genetic level. Humans are in fact remarkably homogenous worldwide ( Moore, Randy, 2004. The dark side of creationism. The American Biology Teacher 66(2): 85-87.)
