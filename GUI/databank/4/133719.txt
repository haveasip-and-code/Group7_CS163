east brunswick
Located in [Central Jersey], its by far the best 'Brunswick' out of all of them. The other Brunswick's are New, North, and South. East Brunswick is home to many Jewish people, and as a joke even the non-Jew's are counted as Pseudo-Jews. East Brunswick's town mascot is the Bear. EB also has an adopted little brother, Milltown. Many Milltown residents pay taxes to and have their children go to East Brunswick Highschool.
