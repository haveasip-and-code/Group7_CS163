waaa
A term used to define a subtle action, occurance, situation, or thing in daily life that someone notices or mentally grasps, which others don't, or can't; usually due to their lack of imagination. Which means that the person is not a conformist and has a richly unique personality, and imagination. Therefore waaa is something that someone has to work at, to be able to mentally grasp. waaa could be many things, occurances, situations; as long as someone who officially gets(meaning understands) waaa recognizes it as so. If someone doesn't get waaa, it may seem like a really difficult concept to understand. People who get waaa are bretheren of each other, and should rspect each other for being so unique. waaa is a noun.(thing)
