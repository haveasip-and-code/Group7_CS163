hole in the wall
Noun: Generally a small, raggedy place (usually a bar or a club) that has very low quality equipment, furniture, etc but sometimes will provide the best variety of entertainment on any given night. Defining characteristics include: holes in walls/ceilings, nonflushing toilets, a ceiling fan instead of central air, $5 'to get in', and only one bartender. Most of these types of places are found in the country and in the south.
