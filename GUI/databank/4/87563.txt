banana show
A signature trademark in the Japanese territory of Okinawa. A very disgusting and decrepit old lady inserts several freshly peeled bananas into her snatch. Once they are inside she then internally slices them up, and projects them onto the stage below in perfectly even, and intact pieces. ; The highlight of the show is when she tries to get a haplessly drunk audience member to come on stage, and eat the banana she has just chopped up. Similar things have been tried, but this has never been duplicated. Often referred to as a Okinawan Pastime.
