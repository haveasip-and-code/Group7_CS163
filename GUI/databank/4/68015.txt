the funniest comedian I've ever heard. died reciently of a drug over dose. said things like 'I ordered a club sandwich and I'm not even a member. you say u like your sandwich with three slices of bread? me too lets form a club. we need more speculations. instead of cutting the sandwich once, we will cut it twice. and we will put things in the middle of the sandwich like potato chips, or salad. how do u feel about frilly tooth picks? I'M FOR EM! I like sprouts on my salad. Well your not in the fucking club!
