cha~
A word thought to be have been started in an online art comunity. It somewhat means the same as [cha] (meaning 'yes'), but also can be used as a form of insult, or exlamation. Mostly feminin. The ~ denotes that the a is held longer, so Cha~~~~! Would mean Chaaaaaaa! which saves a lot of space. For the most part, it only needs one ~. The ~ comes from the Japanese language, where a similar looking symbol would mean for the vowel to be held longer
