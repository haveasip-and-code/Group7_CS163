Lunchbox
Noun. Invincible person of great prestige. Can take damage and come out nearly unscathed. He is one bad momma-jamma and often rides pimp style in his [Kuribo's Shoe]. His name is dope, his chicks are fly, and you better hit the ground when his knuckles float like a butterfly and sting like a trout. ; Cheese is his ambrosia. Caffeine, his nectar. ; He is cognizant of those he relates with and always takes into account their views on even the most trivial matters. He never exacerbates things. He is Lunchbox. Fear the Lunchbox. Be one with the Lunchbox. Just BE the Lunchbox. ; Lunchboxes often like to ride on their barstool of love, though they sometimes take the train. ; They like to dance all about and put their big toe in your mouth while you scream and shout and threaten to 'poke out your innards with a spatula' if you spread rabies in Church one day. ; This shouldn't mean that you should fear the Lunchbox. By all means, no. You should befriend a Lunchbox today because they have nachos and everyone knows that the Nacho People will rule the world of Salsa. With their leader, Enchilada by their side, the Lunchboxes will enslave humanity. ; Will you be a part of their enslaved or will you be dead? Actually, the best answer is 'to be a Lunchbox' but not all are worthy of such a title.
