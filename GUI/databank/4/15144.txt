Seton Hall Prep
Seton Hall is more than just four years. It is for life. The students are known for their sense of humor, extreme pride in being a pirate, and ability to drink more than thought humanly possible. A prep student can be easily spotted by his tie, oxford shirt, khakis, and dress shoes. There are three types of kids that prep students are classified as: Preps from Morris County, Guidos from the area surrounding Caldwell, and Ghetto kids from the greater newark area. Often times students from Delbarton describe Seton Hall students as rejects from their school. However, these students from Delbarton have large foreign objects up their asses(generally dildos), and forget that they would be at Seton Hall too if their fathers had not donated $500,000 dollars for a new football scoreboard, and had a penis that could be measured without the word 'nano' involved. Seton Hall kids are tough, fun, and down to earth.
