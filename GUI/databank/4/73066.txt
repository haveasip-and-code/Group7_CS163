deceptacon
UK. A woman who appears attractive but is actually ugly. Can be found in a number of situations or for a variety of reasons. Clever use of make-up. Drunkenness in the eye of the beholder. Darkness in a club. Nice from afar but far from nice. If you've only seen a very well taken photo. Looks good but has an awful voice/mind/personality. Anything that might deceive you into thinking she's [buff] but she aint. Comes from Transformers - robots in disguise.
