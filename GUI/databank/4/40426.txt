Vaginasaurus Rex
A pejorative term I developed in reference to some, heartless and destructive women. From 'vagina' referring to the mamalian birth canal and 'dinosauria' (conined by Dr. Richard Owen) meaning 'fearfully great lizard' The term is meant to convey the epitome of 'bitch' potential that some (emphasized) women display.
