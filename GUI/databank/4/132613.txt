launch
1. Raise your rev's high enough to do a burn out. (Depends on application) ; 2. Find the best rate to let out your clutch while allowing just a little bit of wheel spin as you slowly apply throttle. (about 17% wheel spin) ; 3. Floor accelerator as you approach full clutch engagement. ; 4. Watch you're rpm's as you gain traction so you don't bounce off the rev limiter. ; P.S. Wide-open throttle shift into second at about 750 rpm below redline.
