Rye  NH
A very small and wealthy town in New Hampshire located right on the coast, close to Portsmouth and New Castle. Only about 5,000 people live there and about 1,000 only live there during the summer. All the kids (and even some adults) have wardrobes full of Abercrombie, American Eagle, Polo etc. Although it's a rich community, the town spends nothing on their schools. It's also a basically all-white community.
