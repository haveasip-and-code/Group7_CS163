false metal
the horshit 'music' that bands like slipknot, and korn make. music that requires no talent to make. based on an image, rather than quality of music. fuckin poser ass shit. i hate it. singers that cant sing, screaming meaningless lyrics, and playing power chord after powerchord, over and over. ; garbage. music at its worst. Nu-metal. ; disgrace to music. disgrace to mankind. ; unfortunately MetallicA decided to sell out to this shit, and they dont make the good shit that they used too. its sad but true.
