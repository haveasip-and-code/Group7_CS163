Mahna Mahna
A muppet song performed by the infamously hobo-esque Mahna Mahna, that has been re-created with no Snowths (those were the weird, pink, cow-like singers in the original Mahna Mahna sketch), and instead with two muppet-females with rather long hair. ; What many people don't actually know is that the song is apparently taken from a Swiss porno, which leaves many to wonder, just what the heck Jim Henson was doing when he came across the song. ; Basically, it's classic.
