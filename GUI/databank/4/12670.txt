new zealand
Why is Australia being mentioned with so many New Zealand definitions? because many a farmer in New Zealand are jealous of Australias riches, but if they would only look up.. to Auckland or Wellington, they would see that we are rich too. And for the uknowledgables who think we live in Teepees.. we dont, we actually are home to the tallest tower in the Southern Hempisphere AND here in Auckland we're not treehugging green peace hippies we're just like anyone in a metropolis RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS and proud.. legit. ; stay cool NZ, peace out
