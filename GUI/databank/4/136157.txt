I fuckin' bate ya  roit?
The sentence most commonly uttered by [knackers]. Translated, it probably means something like: 'I am going to fucking punch and kick you repeatedly, and if you try to resist, I'll stab you with my screwdriver, then steal your clothes and sell them in Clara Market, is that okay?' Usually results in the knacker in question getting beat, then running off into the distance shouting 'I get me brudder after ya'. In many cases, the 'brudder' (brother) is also the 'fadder' (father).
