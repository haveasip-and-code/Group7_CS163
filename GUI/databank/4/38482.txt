cheekologist
A profession in which you prescribe ways to comfort an aching gluteus maximus. This word originated from a woman named Alexiassis Hilmer who lives on a little artificial island which is called Cape Cod. She came to this profession after a jolly ride on her two wheeler one glorious morning and found that her bottom hurt.
