AOL speak
adj. used to describe crappy writing for people who are too bored to type out the whole sentence. can be seen as the degression of talk. for we have gone from saying highschool to school to skewl to skwl and now we are at 'shit' Can be seen the generations hyroglyphics but is rather seen as the stupid writing that takes 10 minuets do decode if you have not studied it. Generally used by people who want to type faster then their friend but end up typing a usless form of skrawl.
