Booney
A resident of Boonton Township. ; known for there hick like ways of living(especially the warnicks) and their great distance in between houses. Many Booneys that are of the female gender try to be a part of[mountian lakes] but they just dont fit in. Booneys and Lakers have gotten along for many years and dont seem to be stopping the relationship. A Booney can also be described as a wannabe laker but that definition is ignorant. Booneys are not posers and keep representing the BT for years now. ; BT FO' LIFE
