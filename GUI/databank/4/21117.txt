Double Loser
A double loser, once coupled with numerous quotes from the infamous Shifter, can break down even the strongest of men and drive them to their own death. A common misconception is that once these words are uttered, the receiver of this insult is instantly killed. This is not far from the truth, but only Shifter can deliver that instantaneous death that many fear.
