christian taliban
These are fundamentalist [Christians] who believe in establishing a theocratic state based on Biblical doctrine. Most of the world's Christian Taliban reside in the mid-western and southern [United States of America]. A growing ethnic minority in the region, these populations tend to be poorly educated, isolationist, and fun-loving in the great tradition of the late 17th century (they advocate flogging of children, burning of witches, stoning for various and sundry offences, and greeting foreigners with a cheery 'You're going to Hell, praise God!'). For some inexplicable reason, they are also fascinated with all matters sexual: homosexuality, human reproduction, 'man-on-dog,' and so forth. A visitor to the Christian Taliban homeland should note that these topics never fail to 'break the ice' and elicit spirited conversation with the locals.
