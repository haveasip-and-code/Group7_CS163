nation of islam
Black nationalist movement that is as different from Islam as night is from day. These people are not true Muslims. For example, they don't believe that Muhammad (S) was the last prophet. In fact, their founder Louis Farrakhan is regarded by the NOI as a Prophet. Also, in Islam you are supposed to be tolerant. The NOI hate white people and want segregation. In short and are actually just racist bastards who are not Muslims. They only use the Islamic jargon.
