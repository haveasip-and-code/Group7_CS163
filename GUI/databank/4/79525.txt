Curveball
A pitch which is doctored by the pitcher to make it have a bending motion as it comes to the plate.The pitch is thrown with a different grip than the fastball in that a pitcher wedges the ball in between his fingers and delivers the pitch as if he were slamming his fist down on a table. This creates topspin on the ball which makes air moving around it curve to the axis rotation of the pitch. ; 'The only reason why the batter is the underdog in this game.' ~Warren Spahn, Winningest lefty of all time
