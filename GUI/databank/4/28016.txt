Dundas
A town of 25,000 in southern Ontario. Sometimes known as the 'Valley Town' as it is located in the valley formed by the Niagara Escarpment as it bends its way around the western end of Lake Ontario. ; Dundas is a nice looking town with lots of Georgian and Victorian homes and a downtown that some people actually use. There are lots of natural areas around Dundas with natural waterfalls, gorges, and forested areas due to the Conservation Authority and the RBG. ; Dundas is considered one of the more wealthier areas around greater Hamilton. ; If you make fun of Dundas, I'll come and kill you in your sleep. Have a nice day.
