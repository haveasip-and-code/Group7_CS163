coldplay
A good band with fresh music back in 2000-2002, but their music style hasnt changed and they havnt grown musically. Over-rated now by lots of clingy fans. They have plenty of talent and work well as a group. But Chris Martin (lead singer) has cocky tendancies and the new album is all the same songs, same tempos, same rhythems. Many bands will explore different genres and cultures of music. Coldplay are just stuck in a cycle these days. Talented, but Milky- White music these days
