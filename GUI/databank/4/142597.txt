GZA
GZA is one of the original members of the Wu-Tang Clan. He is not the leader as the post below me claims though. He put out the legendary Liquid Swords album that recieved critical appraise and is considered by many to be the greatest hip hop albums of all time. He also has put out: Words from the Genius (His freshmen album) Beneath the Surface, Legend of the Liquid Sword, and most recently Grandmasters which is a collab effort with Cypress Hill's producer Dj Muggs. GZA is known for his punchlines and his metaphors.
