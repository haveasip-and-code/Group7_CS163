basement dweller
(n. pl. basement dwellers) ; 1. Any one inhabitant of a subjugated or marginalized minority relegated to a basement in respect to a bureaucracy and/or geographical location in an office environment. ; Despite oppression from contact with the outside world and natural-environmental elements (i.e. sun, fresh air), basement dwellers often find unity amongst co-habitants and enjoy a jovial air. Over-exposure to environment may cause hallucinations, excesive use of jargon and inappropriate behavior, and a tendecy to create fantasies or religous cults.
