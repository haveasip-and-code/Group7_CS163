Colne
A small town in North West England. Suffered years of decline, but in recent years has seen regeneration and is becoming a rather desirable place to live. Filled with Burnley fans and the occasional bastard rovers fan, also contains quite a few man united wannabe fans. Historic town which contains a Roman Fort and was a strongholding on the way up to Skipton and eventually, the Roman Capital, York.
