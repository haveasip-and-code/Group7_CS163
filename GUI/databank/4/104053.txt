balmung
Never mind the other definition. Balmung is a character from the whole [.hack] series. Known as 'Balmung of the Azure Sky', he begins as a legendary player in [.hack//SIGN], then gradutates to a [.hacker], or ultimate hero, in the .hack games. And finally, in [.hack//LEGEND OF THE TWILIGHT BRACELET], he becomes a manager for [The World]. Balmung is oh-so-prettiful. ^^
