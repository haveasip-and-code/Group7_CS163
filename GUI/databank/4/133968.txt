gunkai
Not to be confused with [gunk-eye], this is an exclamatory expression used under any number of appropriate circumstances. There is no clear-cut definition of when to use this word, and however appropriate it is to state this word is to be determined by the speaker. However, if caught saying it in a poor situation, the speaker may be subject to humiliation by his/her peers.
