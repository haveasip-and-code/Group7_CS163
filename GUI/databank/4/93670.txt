ambien
sleeping pill. if too many are taken you hallucinate and see things such as 'little concrete men' and the room moves in weird dirrections'. you may also not be able to walk without falling and looking funny and you may slur your words. its hard to remember anything..usually only a couple of small unimportant memories can be remembered.
