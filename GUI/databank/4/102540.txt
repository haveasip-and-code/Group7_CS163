Van Hagar
A rather negative term used to describe the period of time in which Sammy Hagar dominated as the lead singer of Van Halen. This period of time spans from their album '5150' to present day Van Halen. Hagar took over the lead singer's role when David Fucking Lee Roth walked out on the rest of the band shortly after '1984'. Although the Hagar albums are quite different from the Roth ones, they still kick major ass. Van Halen's next album should release early this summer. Hagar owns you all.
