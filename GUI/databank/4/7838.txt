pledge of allegiance
Daily address read in public schools. Instated by Congress. Later, Congress adds 'under God' to the Pledge. Somehow fundamentalist Christians believe Congress passing a law respecting an establishment of religion doesn't violate the whole 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion' thing.
