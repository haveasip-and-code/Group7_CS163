big mcfish mac
The 'Big McFish Mac' is a custom burger created by the all mighty [Jono]. It's a regular BigMac with two Fish-O-Fish patties added to the burger. ; It's a huge burger and a sickening sight to watch the master of it's creation slowly devour it. ; If you want a Big McFish Mac then go to your local [McDonalds] and order a BigMac with 2 fish patties on it (don't let them remove the beef).
