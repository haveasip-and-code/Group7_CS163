deodorant malfunction
Usually happens when there's not a lot of deodorant left on the stick. You're trying to put some on, you press just a little too hard, and the entire deodorant head snaps off, leaving you with nothing. This has happened to almost every guy who uses solid deodorant regularly, and is really annoying.
