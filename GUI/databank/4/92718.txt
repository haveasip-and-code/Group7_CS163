to the butter
used as a phrase of emphasis on an action word (similar to 'to the max' or 'to the extreme') ; origin: Acapulco, Mexico (at a resort's dinner buffet, the employees did not have a grasp of the English language and on the index card for a tray of French Fries, they wrote 'Potatoes to the Butter'). Began as an inside joke, later caught on as phrase of emphasis.
