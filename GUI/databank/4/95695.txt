Buddhist
An individual who believes and follows the teachings of Siddhartha Guatama, a former prince who, they say, stepped out of his castle and had an epiphany,and saw the hate in the world, and set out to rid the world of evil needs. The basis of Budhism is to rid yourself of wants, and only focus on the essentials of life, meditation. When you had finally achieved these things, you would reach Nirvana, or true happiness. Budhists are often kind and loving souls, who believe there is potential in everything. Budhists tend to also follow the teachings of Confucius.
