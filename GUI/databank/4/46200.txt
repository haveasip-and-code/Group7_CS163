Orazi
Someone who equates being around since 400 B.C. as producing moral and intellectual fiber. Apparently descendent from Roman gods, which is evident in the overall attractiveness of the (incestuously?) created offspring. Italian in ethnicity (majority). Personality tends toward pridefulness and (warranted) self-confidence. Did we mention they're usually hotties?
