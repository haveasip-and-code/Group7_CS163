Kwank
A chinese martial arts champion. ; Kwanks can almost fly, they can jump from any size and make no sound when they land. They can destroy a whole army just using their fists. Their greatest power is that they can shoot nuts from their hands and hit whatever they want totally accurate. ; Since they are so good, they don't have to care about anything. If anyone messes with them, they are soon to be six feet under.
