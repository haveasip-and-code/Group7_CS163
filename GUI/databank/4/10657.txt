ull
a noise made by many strake/st. agnes students to indicate a range of emotions including (but not limited to) regret, embarrassment, uncertainty, disgust, and hesitant disagreement. used best with a hand motion of both hands, palm out, shaking back and forth as if to say 'not me.' we think it came from mrs. mouton, but we can't be totally sure.
