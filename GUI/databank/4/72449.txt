Rye High School
Mandatory outfit: Popped collar (for boys & girls), with Abercrombie jean skirt for girls and sand color khakis for boys. A place where no matter what's going on you'll always have a bottle of bacardi in your hand. Rye inhabitants may venture in to Greenwich to shop. But the only time they drive their BMW's into Port Chester is to buy beer from Mexicans or to go to POCHO bars.
