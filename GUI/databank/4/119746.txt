Lord Wejust
(n) A proper name for [God] that is most commonly uttered by white college-aged [evangelical] [Christians] in parachurch organizations (such as InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Campus Crusade for Christ, and The Navigators) and mindless youth ministries during group prayer in a vain attempt to soften their language and hide their [narcissism]. It's origin is the collapse of the default [prayer] phrase 'Lord, we just...' A phrase containing [irony] in that, while supposedly praying to God, one expresses what are more likely their own desires/opinions arrived at without thoughtful discernment.
