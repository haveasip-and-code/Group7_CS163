new port richey
A sorry excuse for a 'city' that is located on Florida's west coast, twenty miles north of Clearwater. This hellhole is comprised of retirees, sluts and white trash. Recreational activities include going to Wal-Mart Supercenter (there are two), going to redneck bars, or going to Tampa. New Port Richey will ruin you if you stay for too long.
