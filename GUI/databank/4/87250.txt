dupin rares
The act of duplicating rare items and/or currency (usually gold) for personal gain or advancement in a video game. Originates from the MMORPG [City of Heroes] and a forum poster who felt that such actions would ultimately destroy the game if not reported and/or stopped, despite the fact that [City of Heroes] does not feature any real items or gold.
