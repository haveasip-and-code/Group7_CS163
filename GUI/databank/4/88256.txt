One of the worst neighborhoods and housing projects in the America, if not the whole world. Located on North, West, South sides of Chicago. Constant crime, drugs, violence, weapons, etc are/were common sight. Right now the buildings are being torn down, along with Robert Taylor Homes which are located on the South Side of Chicago near the Dan Ryan Expressway near the lakefront (Lake Michigan).
