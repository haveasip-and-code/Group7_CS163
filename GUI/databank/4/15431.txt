cha-ching
Slang for 'time to cash in'. In essence it ; is an autoresponse sigh that a typical money hungry woman will make when spotting a wealthy man. The oppurtunity itself brings on this trance-like state and the 'cha-ching' sound is heard aloud although it was orginally ment to be manifested in the sayer's own mind.
