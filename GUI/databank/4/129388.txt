bhenchod
Literally means 'sister-fucker' - ; originally from Pakistan, this word is now extremely popular within the sub-continent. Pakistanis use it very often as compared to the Indians. For instance, if a bunch of Pakistanis are sitting with a couple of Indians, they will definitely use it way more than the Indians would - in fact, the Indians would probably be a little startled at how frequently Pakistanis use it. This explains precisely where the word originated from. Anyway, in punjabi, it's pronounced 'panchod'... interesting change of dialect.
