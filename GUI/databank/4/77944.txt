Hummer
A hazard to the road that puts the drivers of smaller vehicles at serious risk in case of an accident with one of these monsters. Seriously folks, I drive a 96' 2 door Pontiac GrandAm. What the hell do you think would happen if I got in a wreck with a Hummer!? Gets about 9-12 miles per gallon, and big rich men with sunglasses talking on a cell phone can be frequently seen driving them. Occasionally you will see the top of a woman's head over peering over the dashboard and two skinny arms reaching up to the wheel.
