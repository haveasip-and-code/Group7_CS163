Salesianum
Oh my God, is that last guy for real?? Sally's guys are little preppy dweebs who think they are God's gift to women. Dream on, guys. The only girls who would date one of you are Padua or Ursuline girls - cause they don't know any better. Like you, they must live their lives devoid of interaction with the opposite sex, and as we can all see, that really fucks a person up. And a stellar academic education? Come ON! St. Mark's offers twice as many A.P.s as you, has five phases to your three, and develops students into people who can function in the real world - not guys whose jaws drop at any glimpse of a woman.
