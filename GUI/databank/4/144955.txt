Punta Gorda
The best town in the Florida... no, wait, the entire WORLD. That is, if you're a) on crack; b) a redneck; or c) over 55. ; The only entertainment for teens is the small and extremely dull mall and the overpriced movie theatre. Wait... that's in the next town. ; World-famous as the former Best Place To Live, and now as 'the place that got destroyed by Hurricane Charley' in August 2004. ; Most middle and high school students now attend school in portables thanks to the hurricane that wiped out the (ancient and already falling apart) schools. The high school's mascot is a Fighting Tarpon, and yes, that is a type of fish. The high school is filled with terrible academics, stupid people, a heavy concentration of rednecks and that annoying 'I-hate-the-world-so-I'm-going- to-dress-all-in-black-and-not-shower' type of people, vicious and cruel-hearted teachers, and 'guidance counselors' that try to send honors students to the local community college. ; Punta Gorda is the home to a lot of old people year-round and even more during the winter. None of these old people are good drivers. It is also home to a lot of people who graduated from the high school and whose children have teachers that taught their parents. ; Almost every person under 18 complains about Punta Gorda constantly and plans on leaving imediately following graduation. In fact, getting out of Punta Gorda is such a big deal that some people may even kill themselves if they don't get the hell out of the godforsaken town. ; When Punta Gorda was on CNN in August 2004 after Hurricane Charley, the caption said, 'Punta Gorda - A retirement community.' ; And yes, Punta Gorda really is THAT BAD.
