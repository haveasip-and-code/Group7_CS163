to glans
To glans, to rub your [glans] against an object in the purpose of tainting it. Some teach that in a proper glansing the [foreskin] is pulled back over the object, obviously this creates several problems. For instance [circumcised] males cannot preform this act, and no matter how stretchy your foreskin is you ain't never getting it to stretch around a car.
