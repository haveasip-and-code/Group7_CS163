Alphaghetto
1. Used to describe kids from Alpharetta (or any other nice suburb) who like to pretend that they are from the ghetto, and therefore [badass], when in reality they are spoiled, stupid brats. An Alphaghetto kid can be from any ethnicity (though they are usually black), so 'Alphaghetto' is not simply another word for [wigger]. ; 2. A 'bad' part of a nice suburb (merely meaning that there is not a Starbucks within a five feet radius).
