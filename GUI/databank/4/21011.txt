gian
Gian is a guy (most likely italian), who is very talented. Usually most talented in the area of music, and is best suited to play the drums, but is also good at alot of other instruments. A gian is very social, and very firendly. He enjoys music alot, and hanging out with friends (usually hangs with an Eric). He is extremely funny and well liked. He is also very good looking (usually has red or black hair, with blue or hazel eyes). ; A Gian is usually a very nice person, but don't get on his bad side. If provoked, he can become a total tight-ass, and this may be recieved as being rude, when he's really just proving himself to be the pekker-head we all know he can be. He will sooner or later apologize, but give him space so he can realize what a dick hole he's been. ; All in all, Gian is a great person, and not only sickeningly talented, but he's a great friend...And yes ladies, he deffinately worth it.
