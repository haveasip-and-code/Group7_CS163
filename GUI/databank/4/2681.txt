special constable
(UK) A Special Constable is a voluntary Police Officer who is attested in front of a Magistrate and so has full police powers. Special Constables give up their own free time in order to help the policing effort in their local area and 'Specials' are much valued members of almost every Police Force in the United Kingdom.
