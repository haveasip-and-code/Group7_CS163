Kansas
A state right in the middle of the U.S. It has lots of small towns (soon to be gone :( ), wheat, airplanes, farms and stuff, construction and road work. It's known for tornadoes, but doesn't get as many as some people think. It's biggest city is Wichita which is also the hometown of Dennis the Mennis. Topeka and Lawrence are nice places too.
