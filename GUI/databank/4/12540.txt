acdc
not a sewing machine, dumbass, the guitar amplifier. best rock band out there, still going strong. Bon Scott, origional lead singer, was better than present singer Brian Johnson; but he still kicks ass. anybody that doesn't like ac:dc, take 2 pairs of tweezers and shove them into your eardrums. you might like it assholes
