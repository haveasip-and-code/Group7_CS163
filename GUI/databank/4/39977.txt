dragon kick
The Dragon Kick is performed like a normal 360 Jump Crescent. However after the rotation, instead of kicking with the right leg with a crescent, the left leg shoots out as a front kick. Once the leg is out, you complete 1/2 to one full rotation with the leg in that position. ; Usually used on your kids as a last resort at beating them, if they wont listen. Just administer one of these babies, and you'll be gaurunteed to be asking once to clean the dishes from then on.
