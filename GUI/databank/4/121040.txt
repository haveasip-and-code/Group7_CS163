Point Lookout
11 blocks long by 3 blocks wide, this small beach town is the best town on the south shore of Long Island. Cute, Preppy and quaint and safest town in the world. Although the speed limit is 15 mph, everyone rides their bikes around town anyway. It has everything you need to get by, including some of the best bars; The famous bouy bar, Bayhouse and Alice's...All the moms are milfs, all the dads are dilfs, and all the kids are freakishly good looking.
