XBox 360
A next-generation gaming system that will be competing with mostly the Nintendo Revolution. PS3 is out of the race. Not innovative in controls or gameplay but the graphics are slightly improved. Plus you get an arcade where you can buy bejeweled for 15 dollars, that's a deal! ; Bottomline, It's last years Xbox with better graphics.
