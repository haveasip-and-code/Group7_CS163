UED
United Earth Directorate. ; Name of the futuristic totalitarian government of Earth found in the game Starcraft. Committed a mass genocide of criminals, psychics and mutants to retain the 'purity of the human race'. Akin to the Nazi Germany in this sense, and that of an uber-bureaucracy. ; First makes their appearance in Brood War, in which a fleet is sent to fight the Protoss and Zerg onslaught. At first does amazingly well, winning numerous battles and taking over the Zerg homeworld of Char; even enslaving the Overmind. Later defeated by the Queen of Blades, so totally that no ship ever makes it back to Earth to tell of what transpired. ; Better be back in Starcraft 2.
