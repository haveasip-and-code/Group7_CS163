New Hope
A truly unique cross-section of suburban life, where even historical monuments have homosexual undertones (ie the cannon on Main St.). Every gay man you will ever meet has spent a weekend there at a Bed & Breakfast, eaten at Marsha Brown's, gone on a horse-drawn carriage ride, and spent an evening at The Cartwheel. ; People who grow up there find themselves totally clueless about what the real world is like, because of New Hope's complete isolation from the real world. The sprawling housing developments cover every inch of free space and former forest, and it is impossible to go thirty feet without seeing a shopping mall. SUVs crowd the school pick-up area, where stay-at-home moms wait for their spoiled, oversexualized, burnt out children. There is no culture, there is no identity, there is only the tourists. ; Also referred to by some as 'No Hope'.
