SGT 2000
Shitty Green Trucks / 2000. A Drummondville Kebecstand based trucking outfit notoriously known for hiring English-challenged people and of having some drunk dispatchers and cute secretaries with high bang-ability factors. ; They usually have Mack trucks and Volvos and are underpowered. But newer models are introduced to make up for lost time. ; Legend has that Cornholio once worked for this company but was kicked out for failing a drug test at American Customs hence they thought he was smuggling corn in this rectal receptacle. ; They're a not bad company to work for, IF you have EXPERIENCE or speak Kebeckstander.
