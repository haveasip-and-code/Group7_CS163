Purdue
A College in the middle of Indiana, which by the way has some of the strangest weather i've ever encountered in my life. While it's a very good engineering school, and has both a large greek system, and exchange student program, it's placed in the middle of...you guessed it, cornfields! In short, there is a lack of activites at Purdue.
