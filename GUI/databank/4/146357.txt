Everquest II
Contrary to above definition, a semi-popular sequel to the classic yet dying MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) Everquest. Released prematurely by Sony in order to snatch up paying customers before the also-anticipated World of Warcraft. The game now faces mediocre subscription, and the players suffer from it.
