C.R.A.S.H.
An acronym for Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums. It is a police squad unit originally created by the LAPD as a way to break the infrastructure of crime in the ghettos. It turns out leadership of these CRASH teams became corrupt, and even the most decorated officers were guilty of killing other cops, selling and using [crack], and planting weapons and drugs in order to frame innocents. The origins of the CRASH lead back into the fifties, when J. Edgar Hoover ran the FBI, and as sneak attacks before dawn and after midnight would claim the lives of many black leaders, and eventually the [Black Panthers] and rappers like [Tupac Shakur]. CRASH disbanded officially circa 2001, but very similar units exist across the US in other departments. ; Many CRASH cases are still unsolved, and the LAPD is imfamous for hiding any inciminating files.
