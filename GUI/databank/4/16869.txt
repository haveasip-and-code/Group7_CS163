Light Nazi
Comes directly from the top of McVey (thanks Grace). A semi-derogatory term, taken light-heartedly by the recipient. It literally means that the beholder of the name is very specific in what needs to be done, and expects the crew to do it. If you are part of the crew and reading this, then you need to get back to work! Wankers....
