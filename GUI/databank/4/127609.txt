got you last no returns
A stupid thing boys say in early elementary school that has no real purpose. Kid A will tag kid B, and then as kid A is running away as fast as possible, he will yell 'got you last no returns!' which means that kid B is tagged, and can't tag kid A back. Kid B will say to himself 'darn!' but that is about the extent of its impact on his life. ; Sometimes kid B will try to tag kid A back, before kid A can say 'got you last no returns,' but kid A is prepared for this, and will jump backwards so as to be out of kid B's reach. ; Again, none of this has any real purpose, because it is not in the context of a game of tag; it is just random.
