12. Westport
A mainly rich population. Houses overly priced for who knows why, some of them are tiny and crappy. Kids are mostly sterotypical and own multiple pieces of designer clothing. They also don't know the true meaning of poverty, but think they are so terrific when they 'help out' in some way shape or form. Unlike most other people say, Westport teenagers don't all go to ivy legue schools. Only about 25, more or less, of the top students make it.
