Reticulin
Also known as a Grey, these aliens have large upsidedown-seed shaped heads, black slanted seed-shaped eyes, tiny slits for mouths, usually no nose or nostrils, tend to be about three and a half feet tall, communicate through telepathy, and tend to reportedly smell like plain cinnamon and wet cardboard. They are called Reticulins because they supposedly come from the Zeta Reticuli star systems.
