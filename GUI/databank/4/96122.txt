Gunbound
A great on-line game, free downloadable, where you drive a tank and shoot weapons , aiming with angle and power to kill your enemies. The problem is that there are a lot of annoying people , cursing , botting , hacking so you may be annoyed soon. Interesting too is to find a way to do the perfect shot (please consider wind deviation) by searching from some secret formula, shooting by feel, using a ruler in the monitor screen it is fun. You get ranks and credits. You can also pay real money for credits and with credits you can buy stuff : armour , defense , attack , etc. ; As in every game, you can get bored after a while , but in my personal experience, Gunbound provides you with a very nice feel of community and online-gaming , even if the comunity is a nasty one , so as our world sometimes tend to be.
