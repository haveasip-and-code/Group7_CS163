metal head
One who listens and headbangs to all types of actual metal music, normally excluding Nu/Alt. metal such as Limp Bizkit or Disturbed. Metal heads have since died down in schools since the 90's. Metal heads are typically seen wearing jeans, a band t-shirt, and either long hair or buzzed head. Since most people to not understand the sub-genres of metal, metal heads are typically mistakened with [goths].
