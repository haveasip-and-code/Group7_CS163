tiggenbasty
Result of switching the 't' and the 'b' in the phrase 'Big n' tasty.' A term of frustration used when you go to McDonald's or an equivalent fast food restaurant, order something, and the cashier or person behind the drive-thru window attempts to repeat what you said in either unintelligible language or something totally contrary to what you asked for. This is a stupid, yet somewhat gratifying, way to respond.
