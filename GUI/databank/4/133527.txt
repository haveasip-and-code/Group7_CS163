Di-Whore
A fashion-obsessed superficial backstabber who cannot control her constant desires for designer labels and brand-named goods. She will never settle for an ordinary item of clothing, that is just as good and hard-wearing as a catwalk piece, but will always shop for a pointlessly expensive pair of jeans, preferrably tight-fitting, from a ridiculous store that sells clothes for way more than they're worth because they have a certain name printed on the label.
