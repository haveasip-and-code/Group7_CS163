next time you're dead
this phrase means several things. ; it was a phrase repeatedly yelled out of the windows of certain fast-moving vehicles on chicagos north side at other drivers otherwise too slow or inconsiderate to know their fate had just been so spared, and were thus warned against further infractions. ; it is also the name of a hardcore punk song done by the Rat Bastards referring loosely to the selfsame individual responsible for the reprehensible meteing of such an admonishment to otherwise innocent but perhaps mentally encubmered drivers on chicagos north side in the late 80's & early 90's.
