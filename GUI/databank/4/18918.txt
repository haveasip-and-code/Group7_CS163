pidgeon
Similar to a [bilbo], a pidgeon was a character during games of AD&D who wasn't given much chance of survival. What seperated a bilbo from a pidgeon was not bad luck but a staggeringly poor performance during combat. Custom dictates that other players must coo repeatedly when a pidgeon is trying to attack someone.
