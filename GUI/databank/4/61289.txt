General Chat
A chat room on [Neopets] that was once a legendary gathering place for fun-loving, open-minded people. ; Unfortunetly, the creators of Neopets (Adam and Donna) gave way under pressure and decided that they would like their site to become the new Pokemon. They soon began the sick process of 'cuteification', thus alienating their original fan base of bored college and high school students. In the process, they REMOVED the GC, then replaced it with pathetic new chat rooms so stuffed with unnecessary features that they loaded too slowly to allow the natural flow of conversation. ; You will find former [reg]s of the GC dispersed among the internet. Try looking on [Sensipets], for a start.
