A totally random anti-imperialist punk band that think they're living in WWII era. Either that or they're a pop punk band that woke up one day and decided to be political. Still, their lyrics are amazingly profound and there are some original(!) and worthwhile songs despite the terrible female vocalist. Top of the mp3.com J*POP* charts for a while.
