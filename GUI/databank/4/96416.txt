copper-T
A product of population control in India, and an item of great mystery to high school kids, and cooper-T is a T shaped strip of copper inserted into the sac of a female, to ensure non-fertilisation. The arms of the T are highly coiled. This has a 97% sucess rate. The copper deactivates the sperm, and the coiled arms are a physical barrier to prevent fertilisation.
