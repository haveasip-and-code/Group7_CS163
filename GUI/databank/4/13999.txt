Indianapolis Colts
Perhaps the largest collective group of underachievers and whiners in the history of professional sports. Their starting quarterback - Peyton Manning - routinely racks up huge numbers, loses to the World Champion New England Patriots, and cries and pouts during and after a loss. They have yet to win a meaningful game, even though the NFL changes the rules to benefit their already potent passing game. Peyton will break every passing record in existence, end up in Canton, and have no rings to show for it. See [Dan Marino].
