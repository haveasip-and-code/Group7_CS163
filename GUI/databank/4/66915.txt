Brazilian Portuguese
a branch of the 'official' continental European Portuguese language that over the 500 or so years of this giant country has become as rich and diverse as the millions of people from varying backgrounds who use it. ; It's just a pity that not every country has a decent infrastructure on which to build a quality educational framework, perhaps if the Portguese and the various other invaders had entered the country with a different philosophy, not just one of 'snatch & grab', things would have been different.
