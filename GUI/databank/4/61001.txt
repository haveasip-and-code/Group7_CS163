warweed12
Despite constant failure, and countless runnings with the law, warweed was unable to learn from his transgressions. ; Unfortunatly he continued to do foolish, illegal, fucktard and irritating things; such as deleting RedSky's god-like posts, and manufacturing illegal explosive charges. ; In my earnest, I believe everyone must pay for such unforgivable actions, he is sentenced to rot in jail for a minimum of 5 years; 4 years for disrespecting RedSky, and a single year for manufacturing explosives. ; I have faith. ; -RedSky
