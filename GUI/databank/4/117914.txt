4KIDS
Known fully as '4KIDS Entertainment', it is rumored that 4KIDS is made up of former Rankin-Bass employees (known for classics like the claymation Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer). Once they broke off of Rankin-Bass, they became an [anime] dubbing company. Their first property was Nintendo's Pokemon, which quickly gained the company massive amounts of fame, and, of course, money. They soon went on to get [Cubix], [Yu-Gi-Oh], and, eventually, they bought out [Saban]'s FoxKids Saturday Morning Block and transformed it into their own FoxBox (now known as '4KIDS.tv'). ; They are a company to the core, and as such, care about one thing alone: the bottom line. The Bottom Line for 4KIDS is profit. They will seek maximum profit in any way whatsoever. Usually, this involves drastically altering the anime license they have - re-writing all the dialogue, re-composing all the music, and generally editing the content so heavily it's difficult to comprehend what the show was originally like.
