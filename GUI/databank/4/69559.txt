CQC
Close-Quarters Combat ; Same definition as [CQB]; it's a martial-arts inspired art of hand-to-hand combat. CQC can also be used when you have a flat knife and a handgun equipped at the same time. ; The reason a flat knife (such as, say, a Colt Combat Commander) is recommended with a handgun is because, when you're equipped with both at once, and you're engaging in shootouts, you can rest the knife on the grip while holding the gun the way you should be to maintain capability (see [gun control]). Thus if you suddenly engage in proximity encounter, you can immediately switch between a handgun and a knife. ; 'CQC is only recommended for special forces personnel. It doesn't work for everyone.' ; -Motosada Mori
