Amazing crazzzy band from Watford area. Mikee is the god of madness - a true legend and Justin is an amazing singer. Dan, the drummer, is trully amazing (has to be heard). The rest of the band are equally great and add to the amazing sound as heard on 'The Trees Are Dead & Dried Out, Wait ; For Something Wild.'They put on a brutally loud live show too which leaves you wanting more. They have to be one of the greatest bands of the moment.
