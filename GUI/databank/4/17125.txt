Brumder
A grown man living in the basement of a married couple and their family. Between haggling the couple's children for urine samples and foreinicating with the family maid he manages to still have time for his X-box, picking fights. A Brumder lives off of snuff, mad dog, cheap cigars, and chanellos, along with the occasional cigarette (but only when provided by his princess.)
