hr0nz
Hr0nz is a word to describe an excited sexual state. This word is a derivative of [pr0n], but doesn't necessarily have to pertain to pornography. Hr0nz can be used to describe somebody who has just seen someone that he/she felt was attractive, or simply somebody who is just sexually aroused for no damn reason whatsoever.
