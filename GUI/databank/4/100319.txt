fatback
A layer of buttery cheese commonly found on a [sorostitute]'s back, just above her waist that usually shows signs of [dunlap disease] and may or may not be accompanied by a large stripper tattoo. This type of fatback is mostly caused from drinking beer and eating large pizzas all by themselves. Possibly a major portion of their freshman fifteen.
