scientology
In other words, the biggest scam on the planet in its entire history. Anyone believing what this 'religion' does is true, is brainwashed. They interfered with rescue efforts at the WTC on 9/11, and after being forcefully removed, walked back in, and tried to SELL their shit to people who were bleeding, crying, and desperately looking for friends and family . It's a [religion] based upon a horrible book aimed at converting everyone to be rid of 'crime, insanity' and everything else they believe to be bad. All definitions on this website claiming Scientology is beneficial and good, are probably written by brainwashed arses.
