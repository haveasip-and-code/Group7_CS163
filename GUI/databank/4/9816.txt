POK
'POK' is the infamous sound made by a tennis ball coming in contact with a perfectly placed swing of a tennis raquet. ; POK is also the term given to ThumbDrives or USB Drives (USB Mass storage devices). ; This term is derived from the brand name of Hewlett-Packard USB Drives called the 'PockiDrive'. ; Shortened, edited and combined with the personified 'POK' sound, the term 'POK' took over the old USB(Thumb)Drive.
