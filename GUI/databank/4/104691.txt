dianetics
Dianetics comes from the Greek dia, meaning through and nous, meaning soul , and is defined as what the soul is doing to the body. This has to take into account that there is such a thing as a soul. Popularized by the grand [pobbah] of [scientology] L Ron Hubbard. Science being something of proofs or disproofs the name [scientology] and it's use of dianetics is farsical and insults the very nature of science in the same spirit [Christian Science] does.
