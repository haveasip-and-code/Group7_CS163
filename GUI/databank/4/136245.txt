Loyola College
Small Jesuit school in Baltimore, MD. Known for its spacious dorms, fantastic culinary facilities, and a student body which looks like it walked out of an Abercrombie and Fitch catalogue (including the fine looking women). ; Don't be fooled though, it is a very challenging school and has high academic standards.
