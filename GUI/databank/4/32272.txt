bumblesquito
A bumblesquito is when a bumblebee and a mosquito both love eachother very much and make babies. The cannot decide which name to use because the bumble bee, although being the male, is very feminim and they therefore decide to combine their names. Since a bumblesquito is such a dorky animal it could also be used as an insult towards characters such as jeremy.
