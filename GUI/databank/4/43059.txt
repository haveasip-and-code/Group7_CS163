splog
A unwanted post placed on a [blog] that is used for soliciting purposes. Like [spam], [spim], [spat], and [spobile], these messages contain links to websites featuring the usual array of forcibly advertised online services, such as pornography, credit repair, and prescription drug sales. The messages may be made to appear as a comment from an interested reader, stating that the posted link is to a webpage relevant to the current discussion, or an invitation to view the spolgger's own personal blog.
