white van
no matter how old they are, the male driver of this van will always spend less time watching the road and more time eyeing up any member of the opposite sex. If you get two men at the front of the van, you are more than likely to have the non-driver wind down the window and make some laddish comment. Usually grown-up townies (see also). Also see: paedo, paedophile
