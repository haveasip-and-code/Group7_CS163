Tom Ford
Perhaps America's most recognized fashion designer, Tom Ford is best known for his time spent at Gucci. Prior to Ford joining, the House of Gucci was about to fall, until this genius came along and gave it a spectactular revival. Ford left Gucci in 2004, leaving it, once again, amongst the most prestigious design houses in the world. Many believe Tom has an obsession with sex in his designs--his time at Gucci suggesting this to be very true.
