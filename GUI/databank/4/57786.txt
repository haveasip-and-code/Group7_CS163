Germantown
Often referred to as Gtown, or the last bit of civilization before Frederick or Damascus. Germantown is a small town in Maryland with the most eclectic population of people ever. Rednecks, gangsters, preps, working joes, working stiffs and hippie's all living together. Most locals are known for their ability to drink unsuspecting visitors under the table and then walk out on the check.
