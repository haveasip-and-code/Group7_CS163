Kwanzaa
It's the right-on power handshake of the 1990s. Yet another politically correct tactic to get whites to pay attention to non-whites, primarily blacks. It's a fabricated holiday based on race, invented by a convicted felon, which is too third world for most black Americans, too jewish for black muslims, and too stupid for everyone else. Now that's a fine example for the ghetto children of the world!
