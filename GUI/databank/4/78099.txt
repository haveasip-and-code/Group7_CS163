Crunch Bunny
Someone who makes a big deal about and talks too much about online games. More specifically someone who takes the time to type the word noob, newbie, leet, camper, or any other geek word and can't JUST PLAY THE GAME because they are fueding with someone on the game because of some geeky kid reason.
