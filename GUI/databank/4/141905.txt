Maple Creek
1. Located at 49.55N latitude and 109.29W longitude in a meteor crater from the crustaceous era or earlier, estimated at 75 million years old, which is only slightly higher than the median age of the town, and probably slightly lower than the median age of the people who drive through town and usually converge at an intersection with Jasper St. and get caught in a face-off, because no one knows who's going first. ; 2. A growing community estimated at 2700 people with more to do than Fox Valley, Piapot, and other immediately surrounding areas. Questionable public accomodations, but adequate shopping, even for some furniture and small appliances. Lots of hard-working, helpful people, and if you're 16 and have wood, there's lots of places to put it. Just shop around a bit first, and double up on condoms just to be safe.
