hoosier
a hilbilly from indiana. they got that name cuz the hilbillys in indiana are always fighting with each other and occasionally they mite get a busted nose or their ear cut off. in the case of the latter, after they were all done fighting, the people would be in the street and find the ear and theyd go 'whos ear is this?' and since the rednecks are lazy too, it would just come out like 'HOOSIER is this?'
