lancer
Napoleonic era. A type of light cavalry unit that was armed with a lance. They were used to harass retreating troops. Lances had been retired, but after a group of Polish lancers defeated an entire group of British forces, many countries brought the lance back in. Some countries, like Prussia, had Uhlans, which are the same thing.
