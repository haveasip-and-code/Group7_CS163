Eric Clapton
Eric Clapton was born in Surrey, England, 30 March 1945. One of the finest blues guitarists of his generation. Played awesome guitar with The Yardbirds, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (possibly some of his greatest work), and Cream. Other bands included the short-lived Blind Faith and Derek and The Dominos, before going solo with great success. Clapton's nicknames are 'Slowhand', and even 'God'. Is a great player, but 'greatest on the planet'? I dunno, he may not even be the greatest in Surrey (Jeff Beck grew up not too far from Clapton). Anyway, its debatable, but who wants to talk about music when you can be enjoying it instead?
