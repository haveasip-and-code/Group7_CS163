swan
1. (noun) A large bird that is similar to but much larger than a goose. The most recognized type of swan is the Mute Swan, which is all white except for its black face, orange bill and black legs and feet. It is native to parts of Europe and has been artificially introduced to North America as somewhat of a 'decorative bird.' If geese mess with it, it will chase them away. If you mess with it, it will chase you away. If you see a swan nesting, run because her mate will get pissed and will start coming at you. Doesn't sound very intimidating, but when you're staring into the eyes of an oncoming angry swan, you'll understand. ; 2. (noun) Slang term for a female who was once unattractive but somehow became very attractive (referencing the 'Ugly Duckling' story).
