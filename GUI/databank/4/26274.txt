Scott Storch
One of the greatest hip-hop producers out there rite now. Former Roots keyboardist. Responsible for joints like Lean Back, poppin' them thangs, still d.r.e, etc. and endless jay z, dre, snoop, busta hits. Says 'a Scott Storch song will never appear on a Ja Rule album again' as he is so strongly asociated with shady/aftermath family. Dating lil' Kim.
