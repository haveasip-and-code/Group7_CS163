indian giver
To give something to someone and then take it back. ; As in, giving some unwanted land to the Native Americans (or Indians), finding that the land contains gold, and then taking it back. ; At least, that's what I was taught. None of the other definitions on here seem to follow this route, but surely my explanation makes the most sense?!
