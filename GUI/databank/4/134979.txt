VeggieTales
A video and DVD-only show by the company Big Idea created for smaller children that teaches lessons such as Obedience and Thankfulness through stories from the Bible and also their own stories (still about God). All of the charcters are vegetables. There is one movie: Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie. Though the show is made for little kids, it is actually quite funny and the show and movie are great comedies.
