Devon Prep Guys
Between the prep schools of the Philadelphia area...Devon should be considered the underdog. Devon guys arent as rich as Malvern guys or as sports-oriented as the Prep (St. Joe's) but they excell where the others fail. While the others take themselves too seriously, a Devon guy will make you smile by doing the goofiest thing you've ever seen. They're not stuck up and really down to earth, totally approachable and friendly to the core. Generalization is impossible at Devon, as each person is an individual, a motley crew that may be shunned by jocks but has anyone ever seen Animal House? Who won? [Roll Tide]
