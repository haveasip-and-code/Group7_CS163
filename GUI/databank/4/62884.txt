North Brunswick
Could possibly be one of the most uneventfully boring towns on the face of the Earth. With 6 Subways and 19 Dunkin Donuts in an 8 mile radius it enables most people to gain mass amounts of weight on donuts and then proceed to lose it quickly eating Subway subs. Masterful idea. The most exciting thing to do in this town is drive around to the Manor or Georgetown and hope to see a gang fight or something.
