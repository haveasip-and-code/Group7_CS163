homework
The work that is given to you after many laborous and tormenting hours at a place where the work should originally be done called 'school'. Such work is given for three reasons: 'to keep kids off drugs', to desensitize children and get them used to doing things they really don't want to do, to do the teaching that the people paid to do it in the first place can't or refuse to actually do.
