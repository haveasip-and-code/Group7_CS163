Babson College
Business school ranked #1 in the country for entrepreneurship...average SAT of incoming frosh is 1252...like Bentley College, BMWs and Audis are a common sight; kids come from money; Unfortunately, the sports teams are D3 and suck a lot. Graduates get good jobs working in investment banking or for big4/consulting firms.
