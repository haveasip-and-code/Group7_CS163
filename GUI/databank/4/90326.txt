phish
(1) an acronym for ; Phake ; Hippie ; Ivy-leaguers ; Smoking ; Hemp ; (2) a faux psychedelic jam band from the suburbs of Main Line New Englend that think they're 'funky.' They have some good songs, and I'll admit those boys can jam, but come on! They're so overrated! Most of their fans are also 'funky' suburban soul brother wannabe hippies who actually have no idea what true funk is. In fact, many Phish fans I know hate real black funk bands like Parliament, JamesBrown, and the Ohio Players, and only like white jam bands like Phish, the String Cheese Incident, the Dead, and all those other posers.
