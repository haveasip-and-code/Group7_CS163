swindon
location: SouthWest Wiltshire, England ; a town which seems to mainly consist of 'townies' (see: [nike], [pimpin], [crew cut], [bling], [chav], [pregnancy]) and 'metalheads', or 'rockers (see: [nirvana], [hoody], [piercings], [tattoos]).. both of which hate each other stupid, but have the same attitudes generally; *aggression is the key to life*. the music shops are alright, but apart from that, it's not a nice place. There seem to be nicer people there than [salisbury] and [andover] though. ; *not written to cause offence*
