Calvert Hall
otherwise known as Trailer park, America. upon passing calvert hall you may mistake the school for a grocery store, but then as the students walk out you realize that their red and yellow jackets serve as uniforms for mcdonalds training school. being ugly and moderately retarded are the main requirements for admission, academic acheivement is ignored and will not affect your performance in their soon to be burger flipping career. its the school you go to when everywhere else sees you for the screw up you are.
