wowzone
wowzone (noun) ; 1. A word used to describe an object or being (esp. person) that is extremely popular for unknown reasons. ; 2. A word used to describe the aura created by such an object or being. ; Origins: In September 2005 (according to Alexia, a division of Amazon.com responsible for monitoring internet traffic) a website known as the 'wowzone' ranked, inexplicably, as the 496th most popular site (out of 8,168,684,336 web pages). This led to a small group of individuals using the word as a description for things which had become popular for no overt reason.
