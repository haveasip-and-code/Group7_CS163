Ladykiller
A game invented by Blackjack Ho Dude one day out of boredom. Here's how you play Ladykiller: first, you need an IM program that has access to local chats (Yahoo IM is ideal!). Next, enter a user-made chat that says something along the lines of '13-15 TEENZ ONLY OMGWTF!1!11'. Now, here's the fun! All you say in the room is '15/f/ca' and count how many people IM you in a minute. The horniest people in the chat are the ones IMing you, and the goal is to try and get as many as you can just by saying '15/f/ca' only once! You can place bets with your friends, like, how many you can get or how many you think you can get. The possibilities are endless!
