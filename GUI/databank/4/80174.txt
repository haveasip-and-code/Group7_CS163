Also: [Chavs], [Scallies], [Townies]... ; These are the coolest people on earth!!! Actually...nah. Not at all. The opposite. They are all the most uncool people regardless of their personalities, because, lets face it, they don't actually have personalities. The best way to describe them is to say that they only have enough brain cells to accept people who look exactly the same as they do; if they can look at a mirror and then at another human being and see a different person, it confuses them, and they lash out violently at the other person. ; For this reason, all chavs look the same, with fake burberry, jewelery and tracksuits. They pay for such extravagances (in their eyes of course) with money stolen from old ladies' handbags and government benifits (since the government are convinced that they should rob from the civilised members of society in order to give to lazy, fat yobs who can't get off their arses for long enough to even learn the english language.
