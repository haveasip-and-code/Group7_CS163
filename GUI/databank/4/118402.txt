geezer gamer
A graduate of the days of pong, pac man, and space invaders. A gamer in their thirties and above who plays for fun and the glory of the occasional win, who doesn't have to ask mommy or daddy for money to buy the latest game, who doesn't have to get permission to stay up late and play online ( .... well, a kitchenpass from the spouse may be required). A gamer who ... 'back in my day, we didn't have gameboys. We had to walk in 3 feet of snow, uphill both ways, just to play Donkey Kong'. A gamer from the era of Atari, Commodore 64, and the TI 99.
