INS
Acronym for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the brach of the United States Government burdened with the responsibility of treating non-Americans who wish to become Americans like inorganic garbage in a demoralizing form of torture commonly known as immigration. This despite the fact that all Americans as the world knows it are in fact descendants of immigrants themselves. Note that those that figure out how to enter and reside in America without going through this process are rewarded with prizes like welfare and food stamps paid for by generous hard working tax paying Americans, while those that opt for immigration are made to wait years and years filling out expensive forms, untangling miles of red tape and enduring the vicious, dehumanizing abuse of immigration and/or consulate officals. see also [purgatory].
