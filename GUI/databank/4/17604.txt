The Sopranos
An HBO TV series that focuses on Mafia chieftain Tony Soprano's blood and mob family. Amazing acting, great writing and stories. It's still my favorite TV show and always will. The show is notorious for it's abrasive use of profanity, shocking violence and nudity/sexuality. Certainly not for kids under the age of 17.
