ming dynasty
Something that is beyond the normal minging or to ming. Somehow it is totally unrelated to the Ming Dynasty. ; A guy once said to someone that something minged, the other guy thought that this thing minged so much, it was Ming Dynasty, to imply that it was greater than something that mearly minged, the extensive rule of the Ming Dynasty somehow found its way here to emphasise ming.
