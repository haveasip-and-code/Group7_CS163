the fake sound of progress
[Lostprophets] debut album. One of the most original and kick ass [alternative]/[metal] cds ever made. The album included the ridiculously good songs [shinobi vs dragonninja], [kobrakai], and a thousand apologies. If you have never seen this band live, you must. It will be one of the best acts you will ever see.
