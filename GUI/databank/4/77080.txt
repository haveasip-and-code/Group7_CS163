Corroldo
Corroldos background was a tough one. As a child he was suckling on Siobhans breasts and with a father fluent in English 'Tunnn the guitarr dowwn' was a common phrase. As this soldier grew up, he noticed his back was somewhat deformed and fixing this cost him two dear years of his life. These days he is a popular lad with a keen eye for food fights and also the ladies!
