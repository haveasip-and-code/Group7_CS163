PolyAmory
In its most basic form, it is defined as honest consensual non-monogamy. While some decline to allow that [Swinging] is part of PolyAmory, the basic definition still applies. You will find, though, that there are as many definitions of PolyAmory as there are people practicing it. PolyAmory must have as a basic more than 2 people in the relationship. Not all participants need be involved with every other participant, nor is co-housing a requirement.
