P-Dope
'P-dope' is a term used to refer to methamphetamine synthesized from the precursor 'P-2-P'. This precursor was heavily restricted in the late 1980s and methamphetamine cooks moved to other precursors such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Older speed freaks frequently recall the 'p-dope' era and compare the product to the current forms of methamphetamine.
