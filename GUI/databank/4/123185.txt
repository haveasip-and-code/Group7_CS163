Netherlands
Ofcourse it's (...)ing boring here, but the UK is nothing better, shut up Sjembek. *superiority feeling* Anyway. The country now known as Belgium was once part of Holland, untill they stood up against the dutch king for letting them slack off. Now we have a frikkin small country and make fun of the Belgian people. The Netherlands are known for the Delta Works, which is a wonder of the modern world. We invented some snacks like Kroket and Frikandel, etc. Things like wooden shoes, windmills etc. are all in the past, although some still wear it, for example farmers. We are also known for tulips, weed, red light district and eating raw fish.
