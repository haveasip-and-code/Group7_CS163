captain kirk
William Shatners role on the legendary original series Star Trek. The Captain never failed at anything, always got the girl (even when she had blue skin) and was the only starfleet cadet to ever beat the Kibiyoshi Maru (by cheating), a simulation designed to test how a cadet responds to failure. He's famous for dramatic pauses, which Shatner is also famous for. Was promoted to Admiral in the course of the Star Trek movies, but then demoted back to captain in a later Star Trek movie.
