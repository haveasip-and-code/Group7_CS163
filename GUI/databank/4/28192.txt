rush hour
1) A movie starring [Jackie Chan] and [Chris Tucker]. ; 2) Evening hours when the roads begin to get congested like a fat man's arteries. Usually starts around 4 and ends at 8, reaching total gridlock at 5. Drivers during these hours seem to be more concerned with not letting you get infront of them in lane switches (by speeding up alongside of you) than their own wellbeing. They also don't want to wait more than 3 milliseconds to take a left turn even when there is oncoming traffic. Even if they broke a hundred traffic laws to get there, drivers still seem to obey the speed limit when they are the first car in traffic, while everyone else is tailgating. Argh.
