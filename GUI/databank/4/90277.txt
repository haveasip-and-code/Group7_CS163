Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
An insanely good movie starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. This movie is one of those 'thinkers' that is confusing as anything until the last 10 minutes when you realize its one of the best movies ever made. It has so many facets to its brilliance that one wonders if the writers and actors are geniuses. A truley amazing movie that should be seen by EVERYONE!
