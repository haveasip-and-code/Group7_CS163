sinnocent
The act of being perfectly innocent but of appearing to be guilty as sin. Most often sinnocents will protest their innocent while the world laughs and thinks they're joking. In reality all sinnocents are pure and innocent and sweet and good and naive and stuff but nobody really believes them.
