Alice in Chains
THE best rock band in my opinion. Their music is deep, poetic, dark, emotional, beautiful and just fucking rocks. Awesome vocals from Layne Stanley. Awesome guitar solos and vocals from Jerry Cantrel. ; Some of their best songs include: Man in the Box, Nutshell, Angry Chair, Again, Rain When I Die, I Stay Away, Rooster, and Grind
