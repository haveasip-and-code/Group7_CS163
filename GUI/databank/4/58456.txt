BULGY
Quite possibly the coolest nickname to ever achieve in life. Origine of term was tenth grade Biology class at Loyola Blakefield. Student with improper speaking methods (catonsville accent) attempts to speak of Biology class, however the word Bulgy comes out, and the term has since entered the modern English language.
