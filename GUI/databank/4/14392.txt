Oasis
The most amazing, revolutionary band to ever exist. Started out with Liam Gllagher as the frontman. But due to the lack of success of the band, Liam's brother, Noel Gallagher, joined the group and took full control of it. Their debut album Definitely Maybe enjoyed much commercial success. Their sophome album, Whats the story? Morning Glory establishes, them as one of the greatest bands in the world. The album became the second most selling album in British music history.
