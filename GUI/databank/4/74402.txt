coke fiend
A slave to the white powder that will do just about anything to have more blow. There are coke fiends of all social and financial standings. Stereotypically young business associates fresh from business school are getting yayed up just to stay at the top of their game. However, there are also broke people who can't afford yayo and have to commit degrading sexual favors or larceny.
