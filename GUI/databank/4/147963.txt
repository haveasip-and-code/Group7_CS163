krazy foo
1.) An attempt to communicate the term '[crazy fool]' by using a 21st-century tech-slang spelling. The change in spelling also typifies the type of people most likely to use this term -- namely, those who would never seriously say 'crazy fool' in the first place. ; 2.) A parody of the term '[crazy fool]' used in conjunction with other street-like vocabulary in order to demonstrate its inherent silliness, especially as a result of its modern widespread use in inappropriate situations.
