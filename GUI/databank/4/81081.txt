Minneapolis
A nice city of Minnesota. It's glamor years were in the 60's with the Mary Tyler Moore Show and big industry. Today, 700,000 people live there. 10% of Minneapolis Residents are also Chicago Residents, but they screw both states and collect their welfare. 15% of Minneapolis Residents are white kids trying to be 'black'. 50% of the residents are immigrants. Can't complain about them, cause they are dumb white trash trying to be 'black' and they work their ass off trying to make a living. The rest of the residents are average, middle class residents. 95% of Minneapolis Residents cannot drive slow enough (Constrast to the 99% of Saint Paul Residents who drive too damn slow). Minneapolis has an elaborate skyline, surrounded by ugly-ass sculpture parks created by liberals and hippies. Overall, Minneapolis is a nice city. Just don't be in the North Side without a gun, or you will get shot (usually by those white kids trying to be 'black'). (PS- We regret ever voting for Jessie Ventura!)
