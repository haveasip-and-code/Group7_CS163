Hoboken
a sexy yuppie town located on the west bank of the Hudson River Overlooking Manhattan. One of the Best places in Hudson County to view the NYC skyline. Place where a 1 bedroom condo could go for about 1 million dollars, and where money flows through the town like water. One of the nicest towns in the urban part of NJ.Hoboken gives laguna beach a run for it's money!!!
