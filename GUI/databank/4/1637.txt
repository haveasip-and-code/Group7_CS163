upstate new york
Upstate NY is anything that's not either NYC or Long Island (how the hell do you dumbasses consider Long Island upstate where it's not north of NYC at all)? Places like Poughkeepsie are just Southern Upstate. And you NYC ppl need to stop thinking that you're so great. You're just a bunch of Yankee-loving sons of bitches that believe that there's nothing to life except money, business, and being so damn agressive. And you guys are such punes when it comes to weather. You guys have warm weather, face it. Sure, upstate is all mountain, woods, falls, farms, and small ghetto of cities, but it's much better than being all hustle-bustle and arrogant all the time.
