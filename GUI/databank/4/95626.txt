two-story hangover
This phrase has a double meaning: ; 1) The hangover is so bad that it's a two-story hangover ; 2) This is when you wake up after a night of drinking and partying and you have two stories from the night before. One story is about getting hammered and having a great time. The other story is about having sex with some nasty chick that you don't even know....damn
