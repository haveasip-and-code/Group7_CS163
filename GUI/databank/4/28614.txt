columbo
Lt. in LAPD. Easily the best 'detective' America has to offer. Characterized by: ; 1: A beat-up raincoat. ; 2: An aging Peugot. ; 3: A cigar (the cheap kind). ; 4: Follows a suspect around, irritating them until they slip up. ; 5: No apparent first name (actually, he does have one: Lt.) ; 6: A never-seen wife. ; To call someone 'Columbo' or 'a Columbo' can either be taken as a compliment or a threat.
