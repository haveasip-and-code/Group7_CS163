Old Kaka
Name for a friendless old witch who delights in spending her twilight years complaining about the slightest noise within a five mile radius of her, with laughable threats to tell the council and frankly baffling resistance to the use of a washing machine on 'the Holy day'. Apparently vomits a lot when forced to endure vibration.
