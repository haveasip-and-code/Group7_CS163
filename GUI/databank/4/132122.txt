Gordon Campbell
A Canadian tyrant; a British Columbia politician who does not know the meaning of fairness; a mean-spirited Liberal leader that wants to dismantle anything public, such as education and health care, so private companies can make a profit which is done at the cost of losing the quality systems that BC is famous for; a man who arbitrarily makes laws to suit the sole needs of his government's agenda and not the people he works for; a leader that uses his legislative hammer to crush organized labour without regard for what is actually fair and reasonable.
