The Legend of Zelda
A nearly perfect balance of puzzle solving and action. The games star a young swordsman named Link, a boy donned in green who goes around getting chicks and then beating Ganon: The King of Evil. There are currently 10 (soon to be 11) games, 6 of which flow perfectly in a sequential order. The timeline is confusing but the official one is: ; Ocarina of Time (N64) ; Majora's Mask (N64) ; The Wind Waker (GCN) ; Twilight Princess (not yet released) ; A Link to the Past (SNES) ; The Legend of Zelda (NES) ; The Adventure of Link (NES)
