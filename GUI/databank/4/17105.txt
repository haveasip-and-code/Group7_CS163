Ionny Camp
A boot-camp-type of disciplinary method used by Ionny when he's had one too many drinks. It usually consists of intense physical labor and calisthenics, as well as humiliation and squalor. The main goal of Ionny Camp is to improve on the inner soul of the 'camper' and produce a more productive member of society. Successful campers can even become promoted to 'camp counselors' after commencement. Ionny Camp is not for everyone, so caveat emptor.
