Battlefield: Vietnam
Another installment in the Battlefield series, made by the same people who made Battlefield: 1942, the 2002 Game Of The Year. Although is very innovative in its chopper tactics, weapons and team based strategy, Vietnam isn't quite as good as its predecessor. However, it is still worth a buy, especially if you play online.
