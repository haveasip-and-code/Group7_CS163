bediddle
The act of tapping the interior roof of a car and yelling 'bediddle' once a car with only one headlight is spotted on the road. ; In one variation on the game, the last passenger (driver included) to tap the ceiling and say 'bediddle' must remove one item of clothing. ; In other variations, the loser must buy their fellow passengers a drink. (Not necessarily alcoholic. Just a drink.)
