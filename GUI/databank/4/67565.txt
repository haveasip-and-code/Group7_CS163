Baldragon Academy
Quite possibly the worst school in Dundee. Actually in Scotland....no wait in Britain! No change that to ever in existence. ; I use the term School VERY loosley here. ; aBy definition school is generally where you learn things... ; Baldragon on the other hand is a building where you go on a daily basis to be treated to overwhelming doses of Meglomania and Inequality ; the staff are a bunch of complete assholes
