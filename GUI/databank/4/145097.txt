Man Strength
The common strength of a man that seems superhuman to all those who do not possess it. In middle school recess, if you got dared into a friendly wrestling match with that guy (every school has one)who was held-back 2 years and already had a full beard and drove himself to school, you would experience the force of man strength. The fingers seem made of steel and grapple with other-worldly force. Eventually, you will be in a full nelson so tight, you wont be able to get the air out of your constricted neck to muster a vocal signal of capitulation.
