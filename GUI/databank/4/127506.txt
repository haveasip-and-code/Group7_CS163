Backpack
To think A girl is hot and/or delicious. Comes from the show Dora the explorer when the backpack says, 'Yum yum yum, Delicious.' ; Instead of saying 'That girl is hot.' Just say backpack in order to let your freinds know that you have spotted a hot girl without letting the girl know that you are talking about.
