thadooking or thadook driving
'Thadook' is the the sound made by a car's tires as it it hits the small reflective square lane markers. Thadook driving is the technique used while under the influence or otherwise distracted to echo-locate your vector on the road. When one stops hearing the steady, repeative 'thadook...thadook...thadook', one knows to brace for the impact.
