live 8
Every single day, 30,000 children die, needlessly, of extreme poverty. ; On July 6th, 2005, we finally have the opportunity to stop that shameful statistic. ; 8 world leaders, gathered in Scotland for the G8 summit, will be presented with a workable plan to double aid, drop the debt and make the trade laws fair. If these 8 men agree, then we will become the generation that made poverty history. ; But they'll only do it if enough people tell them to. ; That's why we're staging LIVE 8. 10 concerts, 100 artists, a million spectators, 2 billion viewers, and 1 message... To get those 8 men, in that 1 room, to stop 30,000 children dying every single day of extreme poverty. ; We don't want your money - we want you!
