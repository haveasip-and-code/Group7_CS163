Rams
The St. Louis Rams. Formerly Los Angeles Rams were moved to St. Louis in 1995. Virmiel (SP) was their head coach and lead them to the superbowl in the 2002 season. After their loss (by only 3 points after an amazing Kick by Vineiteri)they fired Virmiel (SP) and hired Martz, which as of today (Friday, December 25, 2004) lead them to 198 Picks. A really good football team with potential, but they should fire that dickhead Martz because they're not going anywhere with him as a coach. He hasn't been using the Rams or Marshall Faulk (Rams star Running-back) to their full potential.
