ubunge
an old african tradition in which ten tribesmen (ideally these individuals will posses rather large genitals) proceed to have butt sex with another man (usually white) tied to a tree or post. the tribesmen take turns, starting with the gentleman with the smallest penis, and working their way up such that the victims anus and the surrounding tissues sustain much damage and copius blood loss.
