langhorne
A kick ass suburb of Philly. Most people hang out at the Route 1 Pub which is f'in awesome (F blue fountain diner). Open all night and a hard place to get kicked out of if your drunk, trust me. Most people go to Neshaminy High which is a sweet place to go to high school (F COUNCIL ROCK, the girls are bitches). Langhorne is a big enough place where there is shit to do every weekend but everyone seems to know everyone (nice).
