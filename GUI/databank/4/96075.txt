work placement
Another charming aspect of being on [New Deal]. After a certain amount of time on one of their ridiculous excuses for a training course, they decide to send out 'students' on Wok Placement - ignoring the question of how, exactly, can you find paid work when you're stuck in a fucking office all day and not being paid for a second of it. ; Essentially, it proves slavery is alive and well in the First World, as well as helping corrupt capitalists make a shitload of money at your expense? How? Put it this way - would Tesco want to hire ten people to stack their shelves for a salary every year, or a steady stream of unpaid labour from delivered from [CETS] every month to do the same? You work it out.
