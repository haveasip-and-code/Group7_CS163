the hot dog trick
The hot dog trick is when you're doing a girl doggy (Soprano style, from the back!) and you take your hog out and rest it gently between her ass checks. Then after a few seconds when she wonders what the hell is going on, she'll usually ask, 'What the hell are you doing'. You reply with a shrug of the shoulders, 'The hot dog trick, duh.'
