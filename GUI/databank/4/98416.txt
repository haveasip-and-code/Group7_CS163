Short for tha classic album, Only Built For Cuban Linx by Raekwon from the Wu-Tang Clan. Although Rae is given the credit, Ghostface Killah was also a essential part of the classic as he was on most of the tracks. With insane production from da RZA, this is a street classic, a must own and at least a listen for anyone truly into this shit.
