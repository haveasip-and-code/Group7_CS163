spite
Due to someone making you angry (ex, friends, parents) you turn off your cell phone, go party, hang out with your buds and doing everything knowing that the person who made you mad, will get angry at your for doing. This hater of yours won't know what you actually are doing, but because you know it'll make them mad, you are happy. Your purpose is just to piss them off behind their backs.
