each
When someone bleaches their hair properly, it's bright whitish-yellow all the way through. However, fashion, in all it's glory (sarcastic), has made it stylish to have poorly, half-bleached hair of the colour urine-yellow with black roots. This form of quasi-bleach is known as 'each'/'eaching' your hair.
