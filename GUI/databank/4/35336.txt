Vrook
A Vrook is anyone who is unable to see the ICP Raiders. A Vrook should be shot (although shooting the Vrook won't kill it) upon coming into contact with you, and if not, you yourself may become a Vrook, which is worse than death itself. The only way for a Vrook to die is by a Jedi killing one, which can be rare because the Jedis were wiped out in the latest Jedi Civil War.
