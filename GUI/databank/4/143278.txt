Hutu power radio
The radio station that broadcasted [Hutu]-supremacy propaganda in the movie 'Hotel Rwanda' and also during the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda. The radio station focussed on persuading people of the [Hutu] tribe to attack the [Tutsi] tribe. The genocide was fairly pointless as the [Hutu] and the [Tutsi] were rough groups made by the Belgian occupying forces in Rwanda, based on physical appearence. When the Belgians left, the two tribes essentially lost their real purpose but still many uneducated Rwandans continued to discriminate against others based on tribes and this led to the 1994 Genocide. Nothing was done by other countries around the world to stop this tradgedy, apart from a small UN force which was not nearly big enough to save many people at all.
