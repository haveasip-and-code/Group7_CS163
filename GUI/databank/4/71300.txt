degrassi-boards
[Fascism] in the form of a message forum for fans of the television show [Degrassi]. You are sorted into a [clique] that you can't change. The three cliques are the [rebels], [populars] and the [musicians]. The mods are robotic and lock every post if it violates the [Code of Conduct]. Full of 11-25 year old retards who like to chat in the [shoutbox] and make retarded banners with zero photoshop skills. You can buy glowing usernames in the [user store] and whore yourself out for points in the shoutbox. The mods train the members to [asskiss] as much as possible.
