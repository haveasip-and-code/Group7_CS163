Cold Stone Creamery
An ice cream store where employees sing every 4 minutes, oversize your order and assume that you will be back the next day to pay them more money for their overpriced product. Kneading ice cream on an extremely cold slab of marble while adding in things such as candy bars, chocolate chips and even strawberries to your order is their specialty. Coldstone Creamery also markets smoothies, milk shakes, cakes and pint to gallon tubs of their very own ice cream that you can take home in order to place yourself into a comatose state.
