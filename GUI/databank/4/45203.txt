Jeet Kune Do
Translated from Cantonese to English means 'The Way of the Intercepting Fist'. ; A more scientific martial art than pretty much any other. It is inspired by the combination of the Tao (Chinese philosophical way of life) and various styles of Gung fu. Instead of practicing forms or 'ways' Bruce Lee thought you should practice being formless like water. It is one of the only martial arts that does not emphasize defense. Bruce Lee thought that being defensive allows the opponent to set the tone and tempo of the fight. Rather it emphasized the theory of interception (hence the name) for instance, the leg is just about twice as long as the arm so if your enemy loves using punches or other hand techniques you can intercept his kick before his fist can contact because you have the range advantage, kind of like a knife against a staff.
