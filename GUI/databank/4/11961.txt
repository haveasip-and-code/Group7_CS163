D.A.R.E.
Goverment funded anti-drug program that sends police officers to teach 5th graders how to use common household items to get high. They also show children videos featuring a penguin and a rabbit who kidnap kids and force them to smoke the 'evil' marijuana. Because D.A.R.E. is notorious for using false information and scare tactics, most kids with common sense don't take the program seriously. Basically it's a huge waste of tax dollars and school time.
