the get up kids
an amazing indie/emo band that recently broke up (tear) after 10 glorious years. they began on Doghouse Records, and were then signed to Vagrant, where they released 4 studio albums and a live album. their sick keyboardist, James Dewees (from Reggie And The Full Effect) was the band's highlight. unfortunately, they never really got the praise they deserved....
