Were a fucking great band. ; Now a fucking shit band. ; Their first LP 'Grinspoon's Guide To Better Living' remains one of the best albums of the last 10 years or so. Their follow up 'Easy' was also great. With the third LP 'New Detention' they were struggling a bit but still okay. Their latest release, 'Thrills Kills and Sunday Pills' signifies the end of an era in Australian rock music. ; For other originally great bands with downhill-spiralling careers, see [green day], [offspring] and [silverchair].
