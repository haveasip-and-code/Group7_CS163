speed
I've used Speed on a few occasions for weight loss, not for the high the high totally sucked for me, it made me super paranoid and anxious to the point where I didn't even talk to anyone around me cause I thought I might say something stupid, and have em talk about me. ; So basically it didn't amp me up it just curbed my appetite and gave the worst come-downs I've ever experienced in my life. Plus it made my jaw move/look all funny without me even knowing it.
