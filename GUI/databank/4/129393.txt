pohm
The correct way to say Pom or pomme or pommy...both of which the Australians use to describe english people. Which is entirely inaccurate in itself because POHm means prisoner of her majesty and we all know that originally the aussies were the convicts britain didnt want any more. So its rather an ironic word for them to use...pohm is what we should be calling them, but we are far too cultured for that so they may remain those aussie bastards :D ; Just kidding guys :)
