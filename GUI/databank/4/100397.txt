subjectivisten
Dutch blog where music journalists (AKA [Subs]) gather to talk about music, music and some more music. It also includes (but not limited to): ; - a forum ; - weekly lists compiled by the Subs ; - a place where Jan Willem can ramble about foreign music he found out ; - a movie review section, though that one is barely used. Just like 'If... Then...Els'.
