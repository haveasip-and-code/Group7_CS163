Glory Metal
A synonym for the sub-genre of [heavy metal] rock known as [power metal]. The earliest example of power metal is best exemplefied (acoustically) by the group [Iron Maiden]. Near distortionless, extremely melodic rifts, and fast beat make a glory metal song. However, true glory metal is often reffering to Tolkienesque settings, involving Dragons, Elves, heros, etc. Also known as, [troll metal], [epic metal], and [fantasy metal].
