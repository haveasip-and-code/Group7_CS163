tickling the pear
Euphemism for [mastubation]. Orginated in the [Harry Potter] fandom. It comes from the fact that to gain entrance into the school kitchens, one must tickle the pair on a painting of fruit guarding the entrance. [Hermione Granger] learns this when the [Weasley twins] let the secret slip.
