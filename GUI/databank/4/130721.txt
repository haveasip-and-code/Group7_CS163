Conservative Party
The second biggest political party in the UK. Has a right wing stance (think more moderate [republicans)]. The party is slowly in a spiral of decline after an 18 year stint in power under the reigns of Maggie [Thatcher] and John Major. ; The party has a reputation for being made up of solely boring middle aged men from priveledged backgrounds. This is statistically pretty true. The Conservatives are heavily supported by the tabloid that likes to think it is a serious newspaper: the [Daily Mail] which is mostly read by grey haired women that spend most of their time tending their middle class rosebeds and discussing the decadence of young people these days. ; Above everything else the Conservatives believe that society is in decline and hark back to a nonexistant era when nuclear famalies and 'respect for elders' existed.
