the daily show
A news satire show that jumped the shark after the 2004 election but nobody likes to admit it. ; It's not a shitty show by any means, but it's overrated, and its limp-wristed commie fanboys should all be kicked in the nuts. ; Some people, also known as 'major contributors to the downfall of America', actually use it as their only source of news. No, you stupid faggots, it is not the only reliable news source, because it is on fucking Comedy Central. Jesus Christ, even Jon Stewart knows this.
