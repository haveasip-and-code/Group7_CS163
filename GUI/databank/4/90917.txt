sounds
Sounds is the name given to stainless steel tubes, of various design that are inserted into the male [urethrea] for sexual pleasure or pain. It is a common practise amongst the [bdsm] community. Solitary use of sounds, by a male involves the inserting of a sound into his [japs eye] or [urethra] and pushing the sound (which is usually well lubricated with a non-oil based lubricant) deep into the bladder so that the head of the sound rubs directly upon the [prostate gland] of the male. Such stimulation of the prostate gland from the inside of the bladder is often described as 'ecstatic' or 'incredible'. ; The solitary use of sounds for sexual pleasure often becomes pathological and dangerous, with the user experimenting with different shaped and textured sounds so as to heighten his sexual pleasure. ; The use of sounds in the [bdsm] community is both dangerous and depraved. The victim, who is male, often has sounds thrust with little care or compassion into his urethrea or [japs eye]. Not surprisingly biological damage to the urethra and bladder is common, infection and serious injury often follow and lifetime bladder incontinence is a real risk. More serious cases involve penile cancer, bladder cancer and tumours of differing seriousness. The use of sounds is outlawed in many countries and to own a set of sounds is illegal. ; The internet, is often the place where sounds can be bought and they are available for sexual deviants worldwide...at a cost, both financially and biological.
