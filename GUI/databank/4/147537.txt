Back Out Rule
An unspoken rule that dictates when two motorists are parked next to each other and inter their car at approximately the same time, the one that starts his/her car first gets to back out first. ; Should the cars start at the same exact time, eye contact should be made to decide who is to back out of his/her spot first.
