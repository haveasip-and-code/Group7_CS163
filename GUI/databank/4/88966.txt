E
A slang term for the drug MDMA, also known as ecstasy, x, Emos, e-mazing, or the love drug. E comes in pills, gell caps, or liquid form. Pure MDMA is extremely hard to come by, and most E is part MDMA, part speed/coke/meth/heroine. The effects are different depending on what kind of E it is (what is in it other than MDMA). I'd say this is my drug of choice, just because the trip is awesome. It can be very obvious that you're tripping on it, though, as your pupils pretty much swallow your eyes, you usually talk a lot and very fast, and people usually grind their teeth or do other repetitive actions with, most often, their jaws and fingers. A loss of appetite is also experienced. E is pressed into different amounts in pill form: single-stacked, double-stacks, and triple-stacks. If you don't want to become a burnout E-tard, I'd recommend spacing out your E trips; Popping E too often can result in loss of memory, lack of intelligence, and eventually your brain will be fried. E can be taken orally (popping/dropping E), or the pill-form can be ground up and inhaled through the nose (bucking/snorting). When popped, E takes anywhere from a half hour to 2 hours to kick in, give or take. Bucking E kicks the trip in faster, but the effects also wear off faster. The average E trip lasts around 4 to sometimes up to 8 hours. The crash is horrible, though: depression, stupidity, slowness, exhaustion, sometimes dizziness and sickness. I'd say the coming down is well worth the trip, however.
