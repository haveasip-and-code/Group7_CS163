Taxes
Money coerced and collected from honest, hard-working people in proportion to their INCOME. This means that the harder a person works, the more he is taxed. Taxes are NOT collected on WEALTH, which explains why rich people pay few taxes. ; Therein lies the explanation why pollutocrats like John Kerry, Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, and Ted Kennedy, who have millions of dollars, want to raise taxes. They have great wealth but not-so-great incomes, so they pay very low taxes. It's YOUR ass they want to tax. ; This also explains why higher taxes are the liberal's favorite solution to every problem. Higher taxes cost him nothing, but the entitlements they pay for buy votes from members of the entitled groups. This explains why black folks like to vote for John Kerry. You didn't think they like his face, did you? ; Note a fundamental truth of the universe: Corporations do NOT pay taxes. Never have. Never will. They merely collect taxes and pass them on to the government. If the government slaps a high tax on corporations, the corporations merely raise the prices of the goods they sell, and pass the cost along to the consumer.
