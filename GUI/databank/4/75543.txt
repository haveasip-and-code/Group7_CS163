49th street
49th Street is a street in the Times Square neighborhood of downtown New York. It has now been cleaned up, but back in the 1970s, it was quite a messed up neighborhood. The corner of 49th street and 8th Avenue was known for its many porn theaters, which showed the iconic 1972 movie Deep Throat, among others. ; I have a style of outfits which I call 'CBGBs crossed with 49th Street.' It's basically Blondie-punk-style outfits but with the tops a little tighter or cut a little lower, and the skirts are quite short. Some of the great combinations they include are silver platform shoes and fishnet ponchos with long lace-and-satin tank tops and punk rock dog collars and spiked cuffs. It's my tribute to the 'I don't give a fuck and I express my sexuality however I want to' spirit of that era. It does NOT = 'looking like a porn star' (that'd be one conservative porn star!). It = being sexy on my own terms. ; When I use '49th Street' as an adjective, I mean 'bad-ass, hardcore, rebellious, defiant'.
