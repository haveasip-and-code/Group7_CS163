dirt leg
A term describing a non-discerning , sexually promiscuous woman who enjoys having copious sex with numerous different partners of the opposite sex. It is suspected that these women are afflicted with or possibly afflicted with various 'dirty' venereal diseases that affect the lower pelvic region and the legs. ; Dirt leg is often synonymous with [slut] or [whore]; however, dirt leg is much classier than saying either of these terms and can be used in somewhat mixed company.
