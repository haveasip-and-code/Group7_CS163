relativity
Formally known as the Theory of Special Relativity, formulated by Albert [Einstein] in 1905. ; Deals with the perception of [time] and distance by observers in different frames of reference which are moving with respect to each other. An observer in one frame perceives that time is slower and distances are shorter in a different frame. ; Also postulates that the [speed of light] is perceived to be the same in every frame of reference, and that no form of [matter] or [energy] can travel faster than [light].
