Penguin King
Noun. 'The' lover of all artic birds. Typically does not sleep, and is liable to attack only if provoked. Generally though, this monarch is just, aspiring, and a bit creepy. If charging does occur, only by playing 'Graceland' by [Paul Simon] will the victim have a chance to escape. Recognizable by a crown of feathery-black hair.
