Spammer
A group of around 200 people, mostly Americans who are responsible for a nuisance that costs businesses vast sums of money - according to the Washington Post last year (2004) it costs large US companies almost $2000 per employee per year. If that much money was invseted in hospitals or the third world instead of being spent searching for the few wanted e-mails amongst the junk it could save millions of lives.
