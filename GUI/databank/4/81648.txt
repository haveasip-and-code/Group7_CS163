titty sammich
Originates from the Mayan Dynasty and was commonly used to refer to a 'sandwich' involving 'titties.' This foreign delicacy is widely complemented with a variety of different condiments, ranging from mustard to mayonnaise. This 'sandwich' is perfectly constructed by placing the 'titties' between two of the finest slices of pumpernickle bread that money can buy. Only few men have had the honor of enjoying a titty sammich, but all of those who have will not hesitate to share their story and its glory with the world.
