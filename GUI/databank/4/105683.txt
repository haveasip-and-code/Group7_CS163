It comes from 'YAma nashi, Ochi nashi, Imi nashi', which means 'no climax, no point, no meaning'. ; In speech and writing, it's a slang term used to refer to stories that focus on [homosexual] relationships, usually between men. Yaoi tends to involve graphic sex, often with little or no plot. The female equivalent is [yuri]. ; A related genre is [shonen-ai], or '[boys' love]', which tends to involve less sex and more cuddling (and plot).
