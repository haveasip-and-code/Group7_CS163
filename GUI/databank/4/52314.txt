Rowboating
Invented when one D Hunt decided to pull a super bagmington serve and instead hit himself in the head with his own racket. His attempt to showboat failed and was term by us as a 'rowboating' incedent. Ever since anything that has happened to one of us that was inteaded as a showboating exercise that failed has been termed as rowboating.
