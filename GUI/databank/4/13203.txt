Toyota
Overrated Japanese car company that cons ignorant americans into thinking their cars are made in the USA just because they 'assemble' a couple of them here. Build assembly plants in the southern states to avoid paying their workers a decent wage & to avoid the UAW.Bland boring cars & trucks that cant survive longer than 5 years in the north due to cronic rust out.
