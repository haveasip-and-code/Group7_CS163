Postal 2
The greatest computer game ever created. The basic premise is that you, Postal Dude, must complete a series of tasks while opting to be non-violent or exceptionally aggressive. During your various quests, you can do a variety of things, such as peeing on people, blowing the heads off of pedestrians, putting cats on the tips of shotguns and firing, shocking individuals (Causing them to piss themselves uncontrollably.), and generally create a state of emergency. The overly-hesitant police are powerless against you and your arsenal. In addition, the game endorses cruelty to animals, allowing you to blow dogs to pieces and mutilate cats. You even have the option of training an attack dog of your own. Players have the ability to commit suicide in crowded areas, as well. The possibilities are endless with Postal 2, making it a joy to play if you feel like having your soul ripped out of your body and pulled into the computer screen. It's a small price to pay when you have the option of playing such a wonderful masterpiece. ; Postal 2 is a [Davo]'s favorite game.
