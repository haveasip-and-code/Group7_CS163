moderate
One of the political categories that is inbetween both conservative and liberal, agreeing and disagreeing with both sides. Liberals say they are 'open minded' when they really aren't, and conservatives know that they are closed minded, but moderates are open to certain ideas and opinions to both sides, depending on the person and how they feel with each issue.
