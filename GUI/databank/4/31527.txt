Concerta
Concerta is a drug used for people who have ADHD. like me! It keeps you alert and really focused on shit. IT CAN ALSO GET YOU JACKED THE FUCK UP!!! If you take four of the white 36mg(144mg) pills or have the equivalent to four of the 36mg pills in the form of the higher or lower sized doses of the drug. Your height and weight may make a difference in how high you get. You can either pop it, snort it, or smoke it. It usually takes 30-45 minutes for it to kick in if you just pop them. If smoked or snorted, it will effect you almost instantly. The high will last between 6-7 hours after you feel it kick in. Most likely you wont be able to go to sleep. I dont think that you can overdose, but if you pop to many of them, you might get a nasty stomach ache though. You should also consider having a reliable person around that will be able to assist you if you actually have any problems. (Your body could possibly become dependent on the drug) Also very importantly, dont get caught with it. If you think that you are about to get caught, you should either throw them out, stash them, or just swallow them all. Dont even worry about it. It isnt the end of the world. Its just a drug that can be easily attained because of the fact that parents think just because you have bad grades means that you have ADD and need to be put on medication in order to make better grades. I take one 36mg pill every morning before school and it keeps me going. It never really helped my grades in school. I can tell you that i never fell asleep during class. It may cause you to have little or no appetite while under the influence of this drug either to get high or to use as prescribed by your doctor. It will stay in your system for atleast 2-3 days as do most [amphetamines]. It can be a really fun pill to have just incase you have no other means of getting high. Have fun
