The Game
Rapper who sounded pretty good when he was underground but in January 2005 he came out with a shitty album called The Documentary. After this release, his labelmate 50 Cent started beef with him. The Game probably thinks of it as publicity but in reality it will do nothing but fuck up his career. If and when he comes out with another CD it won't have shit for sales.
