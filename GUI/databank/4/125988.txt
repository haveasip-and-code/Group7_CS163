Corvallis  OR
A college town about 2 hours south of portland in Oregon. This town is the home of Probably the two most differing high schools in the world. Corvallis High School is where all the poor locals go, the main sustanance of their diet being Alchohol provided by the bums that used to go there. Crescent Valley High School belongs to all the eff'n rich kids who can actually afford the expensive drugs. CHS can kick CVHS ass's in any sport.
