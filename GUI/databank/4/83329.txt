urban survival syndrome
Of or relating to the 'kill or be killed' mentality of inherent fear that residents of crime-prone areas have of each other. This 'fear-thy-neighbor' mentality causes individuals to feel they have no way of protecting themselves from crime or violence, except by killing anybody who threatens or harasses them. ; Such mentality is usually the result of living in violent, crime-prone (typically inner-city) areas for long periods of time and/or watching too much television (no joke). ; '[Urban survival syndrome]' has been used as a legal defense sporadically throughout American history but was first invoked in Texas (go figure) in 1993 by a black youth named Daimion Osby.
