Slipknot
Slipknot comes from Des Moines, Iowa. It's a metal band with 9 members, known for wearing jump suits and different masks. ; They really don't belong in any particular genre, just metal. It's not Black or Death Metal. It CAN be Nu-metal, cuz that simply means new metal and Slipknot is new metal, so...But it's best to just call it metal. ; The members: ; #0. Sid Wilson - Turntables ; #1. Joey Jordison - Drums ; #2. Paul Gray - Bass ; #3. Chris Fehn - Percussion ; #4. James Root - Guitar ; #5. Craig Jones - Media/samples ; #6. Shawn 'Clown' Crahan - Percussion ; #7. Mick Thompson - Guitar ; #8. Corey Taylor - Song ; Their albums: ; Mate Feed Kill Repeat - 1996 ; Selt-titled - 1999 ; Iowa - 2001 ; Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses) - 2004 ; Planning another album right now. ; If you think they suck, sure, that's your opnion, but they ARE talented. ; You can at least be neutral with your definitions, and try to describe the band instead of telling everyone how much they suck, bla bla bla. Let them get their own opinion. ; They're NOT mainstream. Every god damn band that's becoming a bit popular is, according to most people, mainstream. Like In Flames, Cradle of filth and so on. But they're not. Something that is mainstream, though, is blaming every band's latest albums for being mainstream. Just like Vol.3 with Slipknot and In Flames - Soundtrack to your escape. Slipknot haven't got much help from TV or other media, so.. that's not mainstream. I can agree that there is some people, not many, who claim to be maggots, Slipknot's fans, but they've only heard Slipnot's more popular songs like Wait and bleed, Duality and Vermilion. ; Many say Slipknot's fans need to listen to more metal. ; I listen to Metallica, Slayer, Maiden, The Haunted, In Flames, Cradle of Filth and such band. Enough?
