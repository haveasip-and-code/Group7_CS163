Bucks County
A county in South Eastern Pennsylvania where M. Night Shyamalan filmed his movie 'Signs' (which was an awful movie). As a result of filming it in a mostly rural setting, he now gives the impression that Bucks County is nothing but farmers living in the sticks with their cows to keep them company.
