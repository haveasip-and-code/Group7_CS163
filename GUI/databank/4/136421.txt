Another ridiculous, made-up, bullshit media label, which basically states that consumers believe the more they spend, the greater their contribution to the Earth -- and to their sense of inner peace. ; Shopping as religion. ; Consumer practice as a mainstreaming of Eastern religious values into an easily digestible, buyable form, rather like shopping your way to salvation.
