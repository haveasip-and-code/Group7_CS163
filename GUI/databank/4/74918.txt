stixor
1. (verb) In the first-person shooting videogames 'Halo' and 'Halo 2,' there is a specialized type of grenade called a Plasma Grenade. This sticks to vehicles and enemies when thrown. Killing someone by sticking a Plasma Grenade to them became known as 'sticking' the other player. 'Stixor,' however, is an extension of 'stick.' It is usually used in situations like sticking someone from a great distance or when they don't notice it.
