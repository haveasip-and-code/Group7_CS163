IRL
'in real life' ; the last line of defense for someone whose pride has been crushed online. refers to the fact that life offline matters more and invariably resorted to in all online arguments between strangers because it cant really be proven whether you are in fact the varsity-squad ladies man you claim to be or whether you are a total loser and reject who is still horrible at the internet
