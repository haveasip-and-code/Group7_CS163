hamster ball
A spherical see-through plastic ball in which you can place your hamster. The rodent can then navigate around your house, getting exercise. ; One branch of modern philosophy asserts that everyone exists in a set of concentric hamster balls. The wider your world, the bigger the ball is. If you are depressive then your ball is very small. The challenge is to make your ball as big as possible. Eventually your hamster ball is so big you are no longer aware of it and you are free.
