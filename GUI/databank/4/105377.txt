BBC
The British Broadcasting Corporation - one of the most powerful organisations in the British, and perhaps, world media. A completely public service, funded by (or some would say scrounging like a bunch of dirty tramps off) the TV licence payer. At the moment, under great public scrutiny due to its seemingly biased coverage of the Iraq war, the Royal Family and perhaps everything else. ; However, it will return to its former glories when the legendary, god-like deity known as [Andi Peters] becomes Director General. 'Oo-er, Edd the Duck! Don't do that!'
