Adrienne Nesser
One of the coolest women on the face of the earth. She's married to Billie Joe Armstrong, the gorgeous and talented lead singer and guitarist of American punk band Green Day, and no matter what you teenies care to believe, you are not competition for her and he will not divorce her to marry you. She manages to stay out of the annoyances of Hollywood and remain completely loyal to Billie Joe, as she also raises a family with him.
