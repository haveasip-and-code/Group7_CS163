Cannabis Sativa
No you idiot... Sativa produces a more clear headed, cerebral high as opposed to Indicas which produce the narcotic couchlock high we all know and hate. Although most people prefer sativas, Indicas are more common in the U.S. because of their smaller size which makes them either to grow indoors. Sativas grow in the wild in tropical climates, and the best come from the equatorial regions of SE Asia.
