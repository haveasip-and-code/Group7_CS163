flipperjabber
A censor-safe substitute for 'motherfucker.' ; The term was invented by a fellow named Calvin who managed a pizza joint in 1993. When two new teenage girls were hired as extra help, the owner's wife pleaded with Calvin and other coarse talkers to clean up their language. Calvin often recited gangsta rap lyrics throughout the workday, and 'flipperjabber' was perfect because it has the same amount of syllables as 'motherfucker,' thereby allowing the flow of the rap to carry on as usual. This word later infiltrated his everyday vernacular and that of his closest friends who often used the word to refer to each other.
