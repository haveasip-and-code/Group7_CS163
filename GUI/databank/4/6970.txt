Runescape
An online game that, quite literally, could be cultivated and sold to crackheads because of it's massive addictiveness. Also, the graphics look like they were ripped directly from any game for Super Famicon or Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Populated entirely by people who think that by playing that they are socially superior to everyone else, while in reality, they are all just total n00bs. 5 out of 5 medical professionals agree that Runescape can cause extreme loss of sense of reality and immense n00bishness. Anyone who already hasn't had 3/4's of their brain devoured by this uber-lame 'MMORPG' should go out and play Kingdom of Loathing...And, if by chance, you have started playing, I suggest you kill yourself and put yourself out of your misery.
