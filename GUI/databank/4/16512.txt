Serdar Argic
The first automated spammer, Argic was an AI program which would [grep] for messages containing 'turkey' or 'armenia' and then reply about how two and a half million Turks were supposedly killed by Armenians during World War I, even though history remembers it the other way. He would sprinkle in various childish insults like 'gum brain' and assume everyone online was Armenian.
