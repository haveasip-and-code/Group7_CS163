shortshword
Originally a mis-spoken term for a red plastic tube used for threatening co-workers [Short Sword]. Eventually as a source of ridicule, this word took on a meaning of it's own. See [Sword] or [Big red Pole] or [Plastic Tube] or [Threat] or [Ridicule]. Repeated use causes the teasee to tell the teaser that he hates them or he is going to kill them or tell the teaser's boss that he is being made fun of again.
