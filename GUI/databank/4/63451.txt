psychic
Psychic relates to the supernatural capabilities of the mind. While there is no proof that psychic powers really exist, there are many believers. Here is a list of the psychic powers I can think of. ; 1)Future Sight - You can predict events that have not yet occured. ; 2)Telekinesis - My favorite. You can move objects around using nothing but your mind. Many video games, books, and shows portray telekinesis as being very powerful and capable of lifting heavy objects. Supposed real life telekinesis can only do small things like opening doors and levitating very small objects. ; 3)Pyrokinesis - You can control fire to an extent. ; 4)Remote Viewing - You can see events without actually being there. I bet most guys would use it to watch chicks undress without risk of getting caught. ; 5)Mind control - You can influence people's minds or completly take control of thier bodies.
