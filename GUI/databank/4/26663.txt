Lizardman
Character from classic, 1999, Sega Dreamcast 3D fighting game [Soul Calibur], by Namco. One of over a dozen colorful characters, Lizardman was a large, armored, scalp-locked lizard who walked erect and carried a sword and shield. He communicated to his opponents on the 'Stage of History' through grunts, snarls, roars and gestures. ; In 2000, in a house just off-campus from Syracuse University where [Soul Calibur] tournaments were a daily staple, it occurred to one of the players that Lizardman's inarticulation might be a source of angst for the warrior reptile. It also occurred to this player that Lizardman's outsider status could give him a source of strength. Finally, it was collectively decided in the house that Lizardman's bittersweet dilemma was best expressed through early-1980s Glam and Heavy Metal. ; In 2001, a two-minute song of questionable musical taste, based on the chord progression of Danzig anthem 'Mother,' was recorded in honor of Lizardman. Mercifully elusive, it can be found in MP3 format.
