Stingtooth
[Sweettooth] in the stage between human form and the now evil ice cream truck driving, perpetually drunk hooligan. This incarnation of 'Pat' looked much like the popular 80's singer, Sting, around the time he appeared in the film [DUNE]. Although he had not yet purchased the ice cream truck and had not even thrown his first beer, this 'version' was known to urinate on people's dorm room doors and throw fruits and vegetables out the 3rd story window at 'hoofty' passersby. Other shenanigans by Stingtooth included offering to 'eat a girls ass all night' and sporting a pompador while having a receeding hairline.
