Happy Emo
Hah! There is no such thing. [Emo]s are always miserable, otherwise they shouldn't call themselves emos. The whole emo philosophy is to be permanently depressed in order to get attention. Stupid brats. ; Therefore, the isn't any such thing as a happy emo, because that would be breaking strict emo rules - and you wouldn't want to do that; you'd only make them cry even more ; *shudders*
