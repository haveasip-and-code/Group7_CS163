serial monogamist
function: noun ; one who spends as little time as possible being single, moving from the end of one relationship to the beginning of a new relationship as quickly as possible ; although the relationships in which many serial monogamists find themselves are also often short lived, the defining aspect of serial monogamy is the desire and ability to enter new relationships very quickly, thus abbreviating any period of single life during which the serial monogamist may begin to ask questions of an existential nature
