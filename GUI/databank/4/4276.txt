Faux-merican
adj. or n. Faux-merican is an individual who claims to love freedom, but in fact knows very little about freedom. The average faux-merican will tell others what to do, what's right and what's wrong, and encourage or force others not to do things he/she deems as 'wrong'. They are usually conservative, but can come from any political background. They are the people who bash the French for no reason. They are the folks who watch Foxnews and think Rush Limbaugh is a swell guy with a little problem. They're the people who spat on troops coming back from Vietnam. They are ignorant, undereducated, but have opinions on anything and everything which are usually wrong. They are the folks who chastise you for speaking out against the war in Iraq. ; In short, they are the people who give America a bad name. They are closet fascists who think that freedom means doing everything the bible / cnn / Rush Limbaugh / Bill Clinton / or whoever / whatever says. They're the ones who make you cringe and wish you were Canadian when they open their mouths.
