The person who took the real horcrux in [Harry Potter] and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth in the series of seven books. As of now we do not kow who r.a.b is for sure, but fan speculation is running wild that it is Regulus Alphard Black, Serius Blacks' younger brother who used to serve [Voldermort].
