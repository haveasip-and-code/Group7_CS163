newcastle
A specific core for the Athlon 64 processor. ; AMD released a cheaper core for the Athlon 64 right after the initial debut of the processor. The Newcastle core came in both the Socket 754 and 939 interfaces. It featured 512 KB of L2 cache as opposed to 1 MB on the Clawhammer core. ; The Newcastles on the Socket 754 platform ran at 800MHz Hypertransport frequency while the Socket 939 ones ran at 1000 MHz Hypertransport frequency. ; Athlon 64s ; Newcastle (754): 2800+, 3000+, 3200+, 3300+ (L2 = 256 KB), 3400+ ; Newcastle (939): 3000+, 3200+, 3400+, 3500+, 3800+ ; AMD phased out its Socket 754 platform and so Newcastles are the last of Socket 754. Socket 754 will only continue for Semprons (budget level). Socket 939 Newcastles are replaced by Winchester/Venice core CPUs which feature 90nm manufacturing (and SSE3 in Venice).
