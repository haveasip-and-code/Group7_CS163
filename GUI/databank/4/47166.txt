5P33,<
Translates into SPEEK, which, in turn, does into Speak, as in alanguage or whatever spoken/written. Usually accompanies the term 1337, refering to '1337 5P33 <' or elite speak... since, apparently, only those 'elite' enough know about it. Now days, it is needed for survival at the chat boards which are full with 'n00bs' which nly speak '1337' and annoy the heck outta the rest op decent-speaking people.
