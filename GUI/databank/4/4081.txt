WP
Abbreviation for White Phosphorous. ; Type of grenade used extensively during the Vietnam War. Upon detination, white phosphorous is spread over a wide area. While often used offensively, it's most prolific use was with tank, aircraft and helicopter crews. Upon the eventuality that they had to abandon their vehicle, they would detonate a WP grenade on equipment they did not want to fall into enemy hands. ; White phosphorous is a particularly horrific weapon due to the fact that phosphorous reacts violently with water, thus any attempts at extinguishing the fire would result in it getting worse. ; Troops were uneasy about using WP as it is very unpredictable and it has a high spread radius. ; The radio designation for White Phosphorous is Willie Pete.
