dumtard
A combination of 'dumb' and 'retard'. Very similar to 'tard' and 'f***tard' commonly in use today. The beauty of this term, however, is that it avoids slandering those who are truly mentally retarded and doesn't come across as being overly vulgar and offensive. Best used when someone has shown a momentary lack of intelligence and reasoning in offending you in some way.
