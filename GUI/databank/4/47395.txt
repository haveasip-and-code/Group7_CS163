olu
Olu. ; How do you define it? One could ask, what is Olu. But they would be closer to the truth to ask ~when~ is Olu. Scientists over the years have proposed many theories. One such scientist living a [pooey] [schmelle schmelle]y [sad] life, who enjoyed [poo]ing, by the name of [Cobranium], claimed to have discovered a source featuring an output of sound, presumed the voice of ~THE~ OLU!!!!!! ; Some say it's just a myth, but others, oh the others... ; ...believe it as a religion, as one of their own, however there is no strict evidence, or no way, discovered by me Cobrania, that anyone can ever know what, or when, Olu is. ; UPDATE: Olu is a man living in Croydon
