Woodberry
The most challenging boarding school in the nation. In the Southeast, Woodberry has the highest endowment per student (roughly 1 million dollars per student). Many are jealous of Woodberry based on their rigorous admissions process. Those who hate WFS are typically people who go to a school that Woodberry annually crushes in sports (all) and in the social scene (EHS girls especially love the tigers). The epitome of what a school should be; the ultimate source of eduation. The boys that attend Woodberry all go on to be successfull in their fields and leaders in society. Anyone who disagrees is jealous. Woodberry is not cocky, because they are deservingly better than everyone else.
