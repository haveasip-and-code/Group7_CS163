Burmese Mountain Tiger
A sexual act that is supposedly described in some versions of the Kama Sutra. To perform this act, a woman lies spread-eagle on a bed while a man climbs 9 feet(3 meters) above her on a ladder. The man jumps off the ladder while growling like a tiger and spreading his arms in imitation of the pouncing jungle beast. The goal is to land inside of the woman's vagina.
