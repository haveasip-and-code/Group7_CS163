G-spot
An amorphous time traveling entity which lodges itself in the vaginal cavity of a select few women. When stroked, the alien, who goes by 'Glaxckniod' (Though its real name is unpronounceable by the human tongue) will, as a defense mechanism, release great amounts of flesh eating acid and mind control spores into your skin. Hence females' screaming when this spot is hit - immense pain from tissue dissolving acid. In short, do not seek out this dangerous galactic pitstop within your girlfriend's minge unless using proper safety gear (hazmat suit, three-foot dildo, etc.).
