wig party
Wig party is used when tension needs to be broken after something stupid is said. Or, if someone continually avoids a certain topic of conversation while talking with someone else. The idea behind wig party stems from the fact that if a bunch of people get together and party because the all have wigs, none of them will talk to each other for fear of being called out on the fact that they have no hair. Thus, no one talks, because everyone wears a wig at a wig party. Note! This term is not limited to use by bald people! They are just part of the concept.
