Gay Butterfly
Ever had one of thse guys who just hung around during a conversation? Or just came up and leant his head on your shoulder for no apparent reason? Yes?, then you have been in contact with a gay butterfly. Denial is his best weapon, however if he gets you alone, prepare for cheeky pseudo-gay gestures and comments and never let your guard down, he will exploit it!
