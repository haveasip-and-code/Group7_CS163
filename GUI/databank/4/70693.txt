claddagh ring
A Celtic ring that symbolizes love, friendship and loyalty. The two hands symbolize friendship, the heart, love; and the crown, loyalty. If worn on the right hand with the heart facing away from the wearer, this declares the wearer 'foot-loose and fancy-free.' Right hand with the heart toward the wearer means 'spoken for.' When worn on the left hand with the heart facing away from the wearer it means 'betrothed' and with the heart facing the wearer, 'wed.'
