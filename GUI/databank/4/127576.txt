CT 2006
Cement Truck 2006, the car that [Dane Cook] drives, orriginally the CT 2004. A Cement Truck with big ass rims made of tin foil and ornaments, the spinning back of the CT 2006 is padded and Dane's friends roll around in it and suck on watermelon jolly ranchers. Dane got the CT 200 so he could look like a [BAMF].
