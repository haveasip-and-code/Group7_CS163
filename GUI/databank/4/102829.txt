telemarketer
Those fuckers who call you asking you to buy shit. They constantly call you telling you things like 'please don't hang up the phone', 'I'm calling you up on an item we sent you in the mail', 'Hey would you like a subscription to <insert newspaper/magazine>'. ; These lovely individuals. are usually payed high, but work on commission, so they have to be good at what they do.
