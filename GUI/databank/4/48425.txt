hyperanimefan
Someone not quite a normal anime fan but not a [wapanese]. A normal anime fan is an american that likes anime. A wapanese is an american that thinks they're japenese and behaves exactly like a real japanese person. A hyperanimefan is someone that is slightly crazy and thinks they live in an anime. They speak a lot of japanese, make little chibi faces, and frequently glomp people. Are more unusually hyper than the average homosapien. They are quite aware of their americanness and listen to american music, eat american food, don't go to cosplays, etc., however they are a little 'different'.
