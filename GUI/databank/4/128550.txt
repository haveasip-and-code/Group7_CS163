techtv
This was the legendary technology channel G4TV was originally supposed to have merged with, but then turned around and assimilated and tossed the bulk of it away for the benefit of gaining it's much larger viewership. There are many who will claim this channel was just the greatest thing in the world and G4 completely destroyed it's greatness, but the reality is both channels we're incredibly awful. Techtv had the exact same type of line-up with programs that ranged from somewhat informed, dull, to just plain irrelevant which is the exact same state G4 was and is still in. Basicly Techtv was G4 with a supposed technology theme. So many praise this dead channel, but anyone with a good memory who actually remembers it's line-up should know this never was the case. Only about three shows on this channel were actually relevant to tech, the rest was absolutely nothing but Sunni Das selling gadgets and boring reruns of the same military tech show on about 70% of the time. Old fans of this channel like to delude themselves into thinking this channel was so wonderful and great because of The Screensavers and Call for Help, but except for those two shows this channel marketed the exact same casual garbage as G4TV does, it simply did it differently. ; The funniest irony about this whole merger is G4 wanted to buy Techtv for it's millions of viewers, but even after paying twice what the channel was worth(estimated 300 million) the channel is still getting awful ratings only coming in with 0.1 scores(less than 300,000 out of a 50 million viewerbase which I'm sure has gotten much lower by now)during peak primetime hours. It just goes to show, if you serve a pot of shit to five people who also tell you it's shit, bringing in more to try it won't help, you will just have more people telling you it's shit. :)
