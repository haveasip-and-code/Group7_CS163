FOB
Fresh off the boat. Used for Asians who act extremely Asian. They use chopsticks, hang out with people of their own and also tend to speak their language(these are only generalizations, but there can be more). Asian people usually get offended by it, but it isn't taken very seriously. Usually used to define a certain category of Asians.
