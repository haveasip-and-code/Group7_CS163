sitting right
coined by my boi x-to-the-z xzibit on his show 'pimp my ride.' used to describe vehicles. here's a couple of ways it can be used: ; -when referring to cars, wheels have to at least be 17' with little gapage between the fender and tire. ; -referring to 4x4's, big tires and wheels (or just big wheels), lift, drop...etc ; -can be used to describe entire car. very few stock cars are sitting right. often includes paint, body style, wheels/tires, engine, suspension
