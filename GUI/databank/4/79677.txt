Lob Shot
Preformed during a [water polo] game, the lob shot is an attempt to loft the ball over the goalie's head and into the back of the net. A lob shot is generally considered a compliment from the shooter to the goalie, for preforming a lob against a goalie signals that the shooter is too afraid to shoot a hard shot because he fears the shot will be blocked by the goalie.
