scunder
Scunder is a word used in Northern Ireland. It is usually used in the past tense 'scundered' as an adjective, although similar in sound to the Scottish 'scunnert' it has its own specific meanning. A neat little phrase sums it up, 'hoisted by your own petard' It is often a personal retort, 'That's you totally scundered', perhaps by some sly plan that has backfired.
