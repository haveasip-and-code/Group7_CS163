sue
When somebody is upset about something, (or anything) they will sue another person. 85% of the time people will sue others for the stupidest reasons on the face of the Earth. ; When someone 'sues' another, it is usually done by somebody with a huge ego and greedy intentions. ; Although it can help our society and solve problems amongst ourselves, too many people abuse this power. In the end, it becomes more childish then a kid throwing a temper tantrum in a toy store.
