French Revolution
A bloody revolution in france, during that time France is pretty screwed up (like other times but they *gasp* did something besides whining). The peasants found themselves in an unescapable system of economy which taxes denies even simple survival while noble use their hard earned cash to feast and do nothing except kill unhappy peasants. To add to the problems, the new king Louis and his wife Marie Antoinette were incompetant and this only added to the problems. The Catalyst was when Louis decided to call the 3 estates to form an assembly to help solve the dying french economy. Ironically, everyone pitched in the effort to create a more equal france. A series of killings, wars and such happened and eventually Louis was executed along with his wife. This was the event that will soon lead to the reign of terror, and napoleon. The latter being France's only moment of glory.
