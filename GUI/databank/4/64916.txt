three days grace
Worst band ever...especially because all you 'im-so-punk' kids think they're really good. Some of the absolute worst, fake, whiny, mtv-manufactured lyrics I've ever seen. And they always have to be mad cause blah blah they're girlfriend is a bitch and blah blah their parents don't love them and blah blah they're addicted to drugs. SHUT THE FUCK UP!
