A show involving bright lights, a dark stage, mics that don't make anything loud unless you're backstage, cursing with your headset accidentally on. It is custom-made costumes that are 9 sizes to big or 4 sizes too small, it is the reason why we stay at school until 9 on a weeknight. It is dancing, it is singing, it is working hard for 2 months just to walk out of the dressing rooms and get a flower from the guy who swore he'd never be caught dead in that auditorium. It is showing the assholes that a freshman can get a solo and be better than half the seniors. It is that place we go to to whine about having to stay and cry when at the final end, it's time to go. A place where even the most perverted geniuses are forever respected. In the end though, 'Y'all suck.'
