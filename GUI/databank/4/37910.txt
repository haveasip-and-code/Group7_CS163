newfoundland
The most easterly province in Canada, alos is home to the most Easterly Point in North America (Cape Spear). The provincial animal is the Puffin, but it should be the Moose! (even though it was only introduced in the 70's). Rich in cultural heritage, and it's natives are the proudest people in the world, as well nicest, and hard working. The women are beautiful and plentiful. It has a breed of dog named after it, Newfoundland Dog. It has the most bars per capita in Canada ... George Street. Here is where you can find the infamous Newfie Screech. The actual Screeching in ceramony is one that is practiced hundreds of thousands of times a year, both in Newfoundland and abroad.
