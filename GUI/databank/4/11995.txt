Pubby
A Warcraft3, Starcraft, or generally any other game/netowrk online user that has trouble comprehending even the most basic of human functions, usually cannot spell properly, and can't take a hint or 'read between the lines, if you will, at all, whatsoever. ; Pubbies are useless and should be avoided at all costs. If you cannot avoid a pubby, try harassing the pubby with words that the pubby's simple mind cannot comprehend, or perhaps, hero rushing his dumb ass then laughing after you ruined the game for that dumb fuck because he's such a useless piece of shit he started insulting his own teammate.
