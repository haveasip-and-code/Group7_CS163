Race Traitor
Someone who betrays his/her race by siding with another race. ; In other words, something that's impossible on Earth since humans are the only setinent race here, and all are 99% genetically identical to each other. ; If a male animal and a female animal can under normal circumstances bear offspring, and that offspring is also capable of reproduction, then the male and female animal are same race. Simple biology here, folks.
