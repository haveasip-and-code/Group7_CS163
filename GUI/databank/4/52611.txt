The word 'insanity' has a new meaning. Sitting alone in a house in a small village like town in Scotland, causing relentless chaos on the Internet. Featuring heavily @ many Lightning Bolt concerts. Tricking many heavy metalheads into downloading things not too 'Metal'. Some people don't know who to blame, I blame Jandek, his 'master'. Do NOT trust this guy.
