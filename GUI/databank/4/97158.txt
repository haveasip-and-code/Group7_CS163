hose bag
In the late '70s - early '80s, dancers (go-go, strippers) in Norfolk, VA were required by law to wear pantyhose. They got the cheap ones from 7-11 that came in the little pouch. Instead of throwing away the empty pouch, they would put their pot in it, and if a cop searched their purse and found the pouch it felt about the same as if it had the pantyhose in it, and they wouldn't bother to look inside. This is a fact. ; People who don't know this assumed that 'hose bag' referred to sex, a 'bag' to put your 'hose' in - [slut], [skank], [ho] - but the truth is that 'hose bag' originally referred to a pretty damn smart idea to keep from getting busted by the cops!
