The Lingo
An odd sort of phrases and vocabulary used by Jeff Wu, Omar Hafez, Julius Seok, and Neil Choudary, all of Langley High School, McLean, Virginia. They also seem to have a fascination with appending the suffix '-ed' to any sort of word along with the word 'hard' after it, perhaps relating to some comical event that occurred to them recently.
