Central jersey
The best part of New Jersey. No other part of Jersey can prove to be as good as us, no matter how much they try. They may try to be lame and claim that Central is just what North or South doesn't want, but we're too good for your ass. It's the only place in Jersey where: ; 1. Every highway known to man WILL take you home. You're *never lost* ; 2. We call the park Great Adventure, NOT Six Flags. THERE'S MORE THAN ONE SIX FLAGS! (And more than six...ass) ; 3. Close to everything! NYC, close. Philly, close. Shore? Close. Forest? Close. Mountains? Close. Every-damn-thing! Close! ; 4. Central Jersey will be home to the world's tallest AND fastest roller coaster come spring 2005, Kingda Ka at Great Adventure. ; 5. No North Jersey oil refinery on the Turnpike smell
