national post
canadian national newspaper, the canadian equivalent of the [usa today]. absolutely obsessed with [terrorism], [israel] and [celine dion], and it is a sure bet that any day's headline not being about 'NEW TERROR THREAT TO CANADIAN FAMILIES!!!' will be either 'SHANIA UNVEILS NEW SHOES!!!' or 'CELINE RETURNS!!!'
