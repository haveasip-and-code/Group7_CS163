sticky rice
Refers to gay Asian males who claim to feel attracted to (and often even generally associate) ONLY with other Asian people. Sticky rice (also see [sticky] ) often go out of their way to try to show their love (sometimes in seemingly forced or artificial ways) for all things Asian (including men) and tend to preach to other people in interracial relationships how 'wrong' those other people are for being 'race traitors'. For these racial separatists, there should be no interracial dating or mixing. Sound familiar? It should. That's exactly the same racist philosophy espoused by neo Nazis. To be sure, some gay White guys might tend to not go after Asian guys and might even behave in racist ways themselves. However, this often seems to be more a function of physical preference than an overtly conscious effort to make a sociopolitical statement about race, as it is with many sticky rice. Certainly not all sticky rice are the same, but observers will do doubt notice these recurring similarities. And as is the case with many racial separatists, a common theme runs through sticky rice social circles: bitterness.
