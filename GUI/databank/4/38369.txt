Saint Mary's School
'Neath a grove of stately oak trees, these girls grow up surrounded by the best of what Raleigh has to offer. With highly educated teachers and the finest cuisine, the young women are given opportunities like no other. Along with the educated teacher, these 'saints' are able to meet the a-listers of the world... like Cokie Roberts. After her visit, many girls were heard saying, 'Cokie for President' or 'Theo Rules'. Make fun all you want, but we don't see Cokie speaking at Broughton.
