sham
Irish slang (mostly used in the southern County of Cork, famous for its plethora of slang terms) ; a 'sham' is primarily the term used to describe a young male [knacker], specifically the ones who walk around with a chip on thier shoulder, thinking they own everything in sight, and that they are the greatest thing on god's green earth ; it can also be used to show genuine praise, much to the same affect as 'the shit'.
