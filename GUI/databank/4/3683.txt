singing in the rain
When a group of three to five individuals jump someone, knock them down, and proceed to violently kick them in the ribs and face repeatedly (usually with steel-toed or reinforced toe boots). Usually done while belting out lines from the popular song, 'Singing In The Rain'. Inspired by Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange.
