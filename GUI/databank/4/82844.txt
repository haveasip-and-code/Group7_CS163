Powerman 5000
An alternative/techno Metal band that enjoyed moderate sucess in the late 90's, doing tracks for the movie Zoolander, games like Final Fantasy and Gran Turismo 3, among other titles. Origonally they were a 'spacey' heavily techno-influenced band. The produced a few good songs and some solid albums. Just before the release of their next techno-metal album, Spider One (frontman) cancelled the album. Though it outraged many fans, Spider realized that the sound had just become too old, over-done, reproduced, and... dare I say; stereotypical. Convienently enough, they released another album, Transform, which was an open protest on such themes as conformity, stereotypes and consumerism. Still holding on to their origonal sound at-heart, influences of Punk and more mainstream Rock can be detected. The new album, in and of itself has some decent songs, but was not largely accepted by critics and some fans. ; Also; the band has been through many line-up changes, the frontman, Spider One (Rob Zombie's younger brother), being the only origonal member.
