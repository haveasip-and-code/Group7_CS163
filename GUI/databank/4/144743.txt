Sun God
An annual event during spring quarter at [UCSD]. The one day of the year when the social scene at UCSD erupts, probably because it's been cramped up in the library all year, just waiting to explode. Students of all types emerge from the underground on this day. The campus is filled with fun booths, games, and activities for drunk students to engage in. Most students start to get [fucked up] as early as possible so that they can walk around campus all day [trashed] as fuck, pass out in the afternoon, and wake up in time for the concert at night. Students from other schools actually come to UCSD to celebrate Sun God because it is the one day of the year that UCSD is actually cool.
