DISSECTION
A amazing Swedish black metal band that has pushed the limits farther than most bands during its time. Vocalist Jon was in for 7yrs for murder of a homosexual. Jon and Dissection has made it clear they are not racists and the murder was not of 'hate crime'. ; Qoute: 'I, we want our fans to know and to make it a point that it is not and never has been part of our policy or philosophy to be a part of racism and what it stands for' - Dissection
