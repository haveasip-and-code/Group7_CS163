J.R. Ewing
The greatest television villian of all time. J.R. was the money-hungry/power-hungry son of an oiler on the popular series 'Dallas' who troubled others, including his brothers and wife, on a daily basis with his evil and selfish intentions. J.R. was deceptive, tactful, and humorous though hated by most of the characters on the show. He drove away his brother Gary, threatened to kill Gary's wife Valeen if she ever returned to Dallas, competed and sabotaged brother Bobby's marriage and place in the business, and of course destroyed his wife Sue Ellen's life...not to mention the lives of many others.
