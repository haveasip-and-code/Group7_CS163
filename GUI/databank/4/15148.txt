upper east side
A 1/4 square mile hellhole full of some of the most classless wealthy/moderately affluent people alive. An area of Manhattan smeared with dog shit and smelling strongly of piss. The UES is full of rude old people with tacky accents who wear fur in 55-degree weather. It is also home of the brattiest children alive, all of which who have a minority nanny or are cocaine-snorthing whores.
