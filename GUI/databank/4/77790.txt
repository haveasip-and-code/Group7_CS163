Chevrolet
Do you know what a Daewoo car is? I'll tell you what they are, they're a big pile of shit. ; And I'll tell you why Daewoo cars are crap too. In Japan, making a car is an exercise in science and efficiency, constantly striving for a better car in which ever way possible. The Europeans design cars with passion, whether it be German engineering or Italian flair for design. ; However, in Korea, they're viewed as fridges. As anonymous mass produced white goods. There is no passion for the car, they just knock em out fast and cheap. There's no need to design these cars, they'll just go for whatever is cheapest. ; That is the reason why Daewoo cars are a bag of bollocks. Everyone in Britain knows this, so what did General Motors do? They rename Daewoo to Chevrolet. Check it out on Google, look for Chevrolet's European site, there's no corvette there unlike the american one, but there is the shitcart that is the Daewoo Matiz. Wait, I mean Chevrolet Matiz. ; So apparently, by defiling the name of the trustworthy American car manufacturer, General Motors believes that it'll con us into buying their tripe. Every time a new Chevrolet is sold, a person is conned out of their money for some poor quality Korean merchandise. ; And that's why I've written this definition, for anyone who doesn't know. Stay away from Chevrolet cars in Europe, they're fucking shit.
