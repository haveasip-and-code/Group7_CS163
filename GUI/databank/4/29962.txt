Among this group is a high concentration of people who think that their opinions are worth more than ours just because they are rich and famous. Another false belief some of these people tend to have is that real americans (the ones who don't have seven mansions and private islands and jets) actually give a damn about their ill-founded opinions. Some of them tend to be preachy and like to scold people for polluting or being selfish while they drive gas-guzzling SUV's and buy $300 jeans.
