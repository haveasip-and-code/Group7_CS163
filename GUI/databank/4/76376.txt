RJ
The Acronym RJ (pronounced arr-Jay) is derived from the ancient folk word RamJam of the sand dancing tribal clan of South Sheilds (pronounced sowf sheeelds-like). ; RamJam, originally the name of the ancient clan's god of anger, has now been adopted as a modern day term to describe one's 'loss of patience' and is often used to describe an all out 'fit of rage'.
