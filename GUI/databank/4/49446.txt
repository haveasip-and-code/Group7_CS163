Edgewood
Edgewood is a pretty crappy place to be when you want to be your own person. The students including the teachers seem to have been educated around the principle that all beings not like them are inferior. This place is like Mars...with weed, coke, pregnancy, and the most immature kids you will ever meet. It is considered to be hostile at times and should be proceeded with caution ; note: This place does not accept EMO kids, High Class Preppy kids, or Losers ; so they do not accept themselves(loser category)
