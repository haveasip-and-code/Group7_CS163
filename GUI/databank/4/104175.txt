Gema Tanzen
An obnoxious techno-dance track, issued in 1995 by German group Mo-Do, which has become an icon of perceived Teutonic flamboyance and general weirdness. Flat, repeating 808 lines combined with disciplined, order-like lyrics and fractured, nonsensical English make for a hilarious reaction when played for North Americans.
