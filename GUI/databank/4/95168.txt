sports analyst
Anybody who gets paid a hefty sum to sit on their ass in front of a camera and give their 'analyzation' of whatever sport under scrutiny. The analyzation usually consists of their own damn opinion. Most sports analysts in todays age consists of an old player of a particular sport because they either 1) need the money, 2) miss seeing their damn face on the tv screen, or 3) miss getting hot pussy with no effort.
