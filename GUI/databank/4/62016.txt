Flat Iron
A terrible istrument consisting of two hot metal plates. Used to burn and straighten teenage girls hair, by means of taking not pin-straight hair and pressing and holding it between aforementioned hot metal plates. A favorite among the the 13-18 year old age group. Occasionally used on sexually confused young men. ; Can have awful results if you don't do it exactly right. For the teenage girl who thinks that curly hair is 'OmiGod! Like sooo uncool!!!'
