knock-knocks
slang for Jehova's Witnesses. Due to the fact that they come knocking on your door almost every damn saturday morning when ur trying to watch cartoons or eat breakfast. They feel compelled to interrupt your important free weekend morning by telling you about how god loves you and such.
