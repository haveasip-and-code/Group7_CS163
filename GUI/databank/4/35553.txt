canada
A hugely multicultural country in North America that is located above the United States. Canada has the potential to be one of the richest countries in the world, but due to 'royal' figureheads and a faulty government, it doesn't come close. Canada has free health care, and to those who gloat about it too often, it was BRITAIN that burned the white house down, NOT Canada. The white house was burned down in 1812, and Canada was not a country until 1867. And for the record, the most heavily populated place in Canada is not frost-bitten and snow covered, it's actually lower than Maine, and has HOT summers!
