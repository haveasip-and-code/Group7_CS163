Hifey/Hyphee
To go crazy over something and not care what nobody thinks about you. You could be mad, happy, it don't matter. Don't make no mistake about it. This word comes from Oakland(The Town)CA,USA. This word is new to y'all but ancient to us. We been saying Hyphee since at least 1994. We don't even really say hifey no more. We say HUB!
