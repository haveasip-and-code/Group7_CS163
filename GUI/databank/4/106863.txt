Princeton
The best Ivy League school (we're elitist for a reason). Home to schizophrenic math prodigies, religion professors who release rap albums, and a student body that knows how to filibuster. Even engineers have been know to have fun here, and students of the Humanities recite lengthy passages from the classics when they get drunk after finals. Between the nuclear physicists at the Elementary Particles Lab, the Pre-Meds in one of the world's best Mol Bio programs, the soon-to-be fabulously wealthy I-Bankers coming from the Econ department, and the future leaders being groomed at Woody Woo, Princeton should be ready to commence its plans for world domination within the decade. In fact, we've already begun to... but no, I've said too much already. You'll just have to wait and see for yourself.
