Milwaukee Brewers
A Major League Baseball team formerly known as the Seattle Pilots and Milwaukee Braves. The Brewers have been one of the worst teams for the past couple decades and have only seen the World Series once(1982). They are historically known as being a younger team, but recently with new ownership and double their old salary have been able to aquire more experienced players.
