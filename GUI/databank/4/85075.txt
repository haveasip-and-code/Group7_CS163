Electroplankton
A game for the [Nintendo DS] which is one of [Nintendo]'s primary examples of games which 'break the mold' of videogames. It was created by Toshio Iwai, a multimedia artist in Japan, and published by Nintendo. ; Electroplakton is not really a 'game,' exactly, as much as it is sort of an electronic musical toy, played on the Nintendo DS. there is no goal, no score, no timer, nothing to unlock, no skill levels, no nothing. Just a musical toy which can be used to create audio-visual art pieces (or not) by interacting with various sets of plankton, each of which have their own behavioral patterns and sounds. While many people will have a fun time creating unique musical beats and sounds, many people will also think that this game is a large waste of money. As of May 2005, it has only been released in Japan, and no american release information is available.
