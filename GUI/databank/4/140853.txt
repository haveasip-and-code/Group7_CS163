Polish
I heard the fact before, number 7 of the definition list, that Polish 'Horsemen' lent to the term Italian 'Stallion' as the result of the Polish mother's genetic tendency for increased 'girth' and an Italian fathering the son, with the Italian historic reputation for 'length' resulted in what is the term Italian 'Stallion' aka Italian Horsemen, men married to Polish women resulting a son's perfected 'size' this is the truth. I come from an old Italian family. I am a Italian/Polonian male (mother Polish,) and I am living proof of this definition. I am a bit over 7' long x a bit over 5' around (exactly as the engineer from Zurich described.)I'll add that European and English aristocrats are also circumcised.
