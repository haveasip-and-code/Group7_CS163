Mets Fans
People who spend way too much time on Urban Dictionary clicking the thumbs down on the latest factual information regarding their underachieving and boorish New York sports franchise. The fact of the matter is, the Mets had a lucky season in 1986 and have done very little since then. Their claim to fame that season Dwight Gooden cannot keep his nose clean and they continue to play in Shea Stadium in Queens. I have seen the stadium myself and can honestly say it needs to be demolished or turned into a museum. Perhaps the Mets will stop being mediocre and become competitive. It's pathetic that the Braves continue to dominate the National League East, not to mention the fact the Mets can barely compete with a team that was on the brink of folding and a franchise that cannot fill a stadium or keep a team in tact. Mets fans are also used to being pampered by a bias East Coast media which for some odd reason favors them to compete with the Braves for the division title each season.
