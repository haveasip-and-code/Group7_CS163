epidural
Epidural, n.: a shot to the epidural section of the spine using an inhumanely large needle which stays in place for 30 mins or more, causing intense pain and discomfort which will linger for days, may or may not reduce the risk of back surgery. The pain of this procedure can only be partially alleviated by watching 'Friends' DVDs in your underwear.
