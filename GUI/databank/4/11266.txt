etherfem
noun, that perfect woman defined uniquely in each man's mind, who simply doesn't exist but who he is convinced may be waiting just around the corner with open arms (and undoubtedly other body parts) just for him, the thought of whom sometimes causes him to act like an ass to the actual, nearly perfect realfem standing right in front of him (note: realfem, the one he really wants but is too damn stupid to realize it; etherman, male etherbeing sought after by woman similarly afflicted per above)
