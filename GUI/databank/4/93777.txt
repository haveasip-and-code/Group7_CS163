GRE
Graduate Record Examination. Yeah, even if you're done with high school, the Collegeboard will still torment you with the GRE if you want to get into graduate school. While the main GRE test is very similar to the SAT, there are also subject-based GRE tests. For inexplicable reasons, most graduate schools still require them even though research and GPA are FAR MORE IMPORTANT.
