Hootie Hoo
Ironically, Hootie hoo was first heard on the whitest show on television,The Andy Griffith Show. It was the greeting at the lodge to which Andy belonged. Its current usage would be more surprising if there were not so many other references to the show in urban colloquial language (e.g. Opie)
