non-music
So-called music which is either someone talking (they call it rapping) about how they busted a cap in their wife's head over less than 7 seconds of unique sequences of tones (usually bass), or music where an electric guitar is strummed at 100% total harmonic distortion and someone screams worshipping praise to Satan but you can't understand them and it sounds like they are trying to throw up.
