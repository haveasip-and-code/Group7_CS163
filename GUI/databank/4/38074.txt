ass out
verb: To 'ass out' is akin to 'passing out,' although it generally means going to sleep in a haphazard manner as opposed to becoming unconscious. For instance, after a long night of partying, one will generally ass out as soon as they get home, often falling asleep with their clothes still on or maybe on a couch.
