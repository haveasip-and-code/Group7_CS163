The Sway
A large organized group of people involved in a slow dance. All are connected by holding hands, with arms over shoulders, or around waists. The group sways back and forth. This originated in an Gay Straight Alliance Leadership Training in Antioch California. Now, the Sway can be found at LGBTQ events in the California Bay Area.
