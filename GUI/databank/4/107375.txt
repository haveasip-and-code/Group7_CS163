Myspace Loser
The kind of person who sends myspace friends invites to everyone they have made eye contact with in the past 5 years so they can ultimatly have a higher friends number. They can also be found adding slutty girls to their friends list, then making non-oringnal, sometimes perverted comments like ' ohh baby i like that' or ' dam gurl das nice' Their picture can be emo or ghetto gangsta. The best part of the day is when they recieve friends invites, while looking at who would like to be their friend they will never see who sent the invite or even look to see if they know them. All they know is that one more friend makes them so much cooler and/or pimper. In the end they will never talk to 3% of their friends but pretend to themself they are cooler then that other myspace kid because they have 265 friends.
