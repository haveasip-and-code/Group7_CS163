romeo and juliet
A tragedy written by William Shakespeare about 400 years ago. ; Basically it's about two people who are in 'forbidden love' because their parents hate each other, but they get married about 12 hours after they first met. ; Yeah, then they get killed about four days later. ; A lot of other people die, too. ; It's pretty relevant to our time period, since it still happens between couples all over the place.
