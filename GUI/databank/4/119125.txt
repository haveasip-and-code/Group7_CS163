Nina Williams
In the Tekken series, Nina Williams is the best character in the game (can be disputed). Great poking attacks, fast jabs, over-the-top kick attacks, insane attack reversals, a great wake-up game, the best throws/throw follow-ups, and a high level of sexual attractiveness. These components make her one of- if not the- best character in the Tekken series.
