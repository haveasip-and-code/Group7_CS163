upchuck
Chuck means to throw, and also sounds like 'chunks' so it's a fun term for throwing up (vomiting). There was a joke (now quite antique) when Princess Diana was first pregnant. 'Do you know what Charles and Diana are going to name their baby? Up. Because then they can be 'Up, Chuck and Di'.' (Upchuck and die, which was funny then because the going insult in those days was 'eat shit and die.') You can also recite, a la 'How much wood could a woodchuck chuck...'...
