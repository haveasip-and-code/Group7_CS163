L67
From the days when man walked on the moon and Lee Harvey Oswald walked on the 6th floor of the Dallas Book Repository, so too were they driven around by the old 60's Buick pushrod V8. From the bowels of this iron artificat, the Buick 3800 Series II supercharged 3.8L V6 engine breathes life. Based on the highly popular, cult-status Grand National Buick V6 turbocharged engine, the L67 is a FWD transverse variation of the late 80's supercar. ; GM likes to put the L67 under the hoods of those cars it thinks should be peppy enough to have a V8, but that aren't expensive enough to have a transmission or drivetrain to support one. You'll find these engines crawling around on their front two wheels and tearing up the dragstrip (and their transmissions). Much of the L67's technology can actually be found close-by in the infamous [LS1] engine (same basic pushrod V8 design, crank driven oil pump, roller rockers, and so forth), except one can't help but notice that the GM L67 engine is 'pointin' the wrong way, missin' 2 liters, and has 2 few cyllinders.' ; Nevertheless, the next time you're tromping around in your plain-jane V8 powered sportscar and you pull up next to a peppy grocery-gettin Pontiac or Granny-Mobile sporting 40 years of proud Buick pushrod technology, and you hear the faint whine of a supercharger, don't be surprised if you get a good look at its taillights.
