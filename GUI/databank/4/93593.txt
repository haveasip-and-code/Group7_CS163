lap tag
lap tag often reminds people of [lap dance] but isn't really the same. one person sits in the middle of a ring composed of partners, with one partner in between the legs of the other, with everyone facing inward. the middle person calls out the name of someone in the inner ring, and the people in the outer ring have to try to keep the person from getting to the person in the middle. ; sometimes results in breast grabbing and crotch-kicking.
