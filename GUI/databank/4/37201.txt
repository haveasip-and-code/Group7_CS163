Lombax
A species of alien in the series [Ratchet and Clank] by Insomniac Games. They have yellow fur with orange-brown stripes, large eyes and ears, and tails with lighter tufts on the end. They stand around 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall, though sometimes taller. Two varieties exist, the Veldinian (smaller and adapted to airid climates) and a second native to either Frosca or Dangara (the name of the planet is contested, but it is known to be cold, with taller Lombaxes).
