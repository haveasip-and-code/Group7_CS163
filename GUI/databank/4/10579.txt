the simpsons
A show which at one time had you on the floor laughing. Among all of FOX's failed attempts at successful TV (Titus, That 80s Show, Greg The Bunny, Futurama, etc.), it's one of the few shows that really brought up the ratings for FOX (Family Guy, That 70s Show, The Simpsons). However, it's getting old and unfortunately enough, is taking the same path as Seinfeld, which, thankfully, was cancelled just after its peak. The Simpsons are now entering their what...16th season? And the jokes are becoming drab and uninteresting. Becoming as big of a shame to itself as Godfather III.
