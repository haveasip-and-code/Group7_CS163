gay marriage
gay marriage is a union between two people of the same sex. It is between two people that love each just like any other marriage. And some of you are saying that if you're gay you can go back,but if your gay, you can't go back,it's how you feel,I'm guessing that those who think that they can do not know a gay person. People would not go through all that emotional pain ((and physical pain, if you include what people do to them)) if they could just go back.And it is not due to parents that mother to much, considering there are families with one gay child, and none of the others are.
