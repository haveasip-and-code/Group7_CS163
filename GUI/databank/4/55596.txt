monopoly
Where a single institution controls all of the supply for a good in a market. ; However, a monopoly cannot last in the long run, unless a barrier to entry exists in the market. ; Barriers to entry include: ; - control of natural resources or inputs ; - economies of scale ; - technological superiority ; - legal restrictions imposed by governments, including patents and copyrights. ; A monopolist maximizes profit by producing a little less than the market equilibrium, driving up the price of the good. This creates a deadweight loss to society, (some mutually beneficial transactions are forgone), which is why a monopoly is discouraged or illegal in many parts of the world.
