shooting star
When someone is done smoking a cigarette, they toss the still lit butt at you, thus the 'shooting star' effect. The usual aim for this is to either burn a hole in your clothes or have it go down your shirt without you noticing. Usually, unless they're real bastards, they will shout 'shooting star' to give you a warning about what they're about to do.
