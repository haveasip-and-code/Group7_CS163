Manimal
Noun (n) - The inner demon that can emerge when the body's defenses are weakened by the consumption of hard liquor. It posesses the host, causing destruction, terror, and mayhem until the alcohol has been flushed from the system. It has an insatiable appetite for broken glass. At this point the demon goes into remission until the next drinking binge.
