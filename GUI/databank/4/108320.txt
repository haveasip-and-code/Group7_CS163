bergerking
(burr-gerk^eng) a mime of orgasm carried out by guys whose blood alcohol content prevents erection - never mind a bonafide spooge event - usually in the loo of a 24 hour fast food emporium, near dirty moist tile so that the charade can be completed with a rubbing of imaginary ejaculate fluid with toe of shoe.
