Christian rock
Although some believe otherwise, rock is a sound and not a lyrical theme. Therefore, Christian rock is made possible. Most good Christian rock addresses real issues like suicide, partying, backstabbing 'friends,' death, broken families, sex, murder, etc.--but all from a Christian view. It doesn't ignore the world and the themes of secular rock. It just has them with a twist that often points the listener to Jesus. Some say that only secular rock is 'real'. I say secular rock goes around in circles, while Christian rock points you in the right direction. Do you want to go around in circles, or would you prefer to find meaning in life and accomplish something?
