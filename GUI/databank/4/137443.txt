bumper fucker
(n). See [tailgater] or [bumper rider]. Anyone driving so dangerously close to another car's bumper that the driver in the front car cannot see the tailgating car in the rear view mirror. The driver who bumper fucks sometimes often does so and then turns off on a side street. This is called bump and dump. Bumper fuckers who tailgate, then drop back then tailgate and drop back, is a daredevil tactic known as clipping and dipping.
