china
Three points: ; 1. China is NOT a fucked up country. You think they look down on people of other countries? Hark who's talking. ; 2. If you want to know an unbiased account of what the country China is, go to Wikipedia. If you only want to bash China, go add a definition. ; 3. If you want to know slang definitions of the word 'china', you can either a) go to [china] and ignore the definitions that flame China and its people. b) I have heard it used as a substance nice plates and cups are made out of.
