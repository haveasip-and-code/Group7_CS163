holy roller
Holy Roller was a derogatory expression for the classical Pentecostals who believed in dancing for joy with the Holy Spirit. The people who made up the expression were just rumor mongers who actually believed that Pentecostals actually rolled in the floor until they got holy. Some people misspell 'Pentecostal' as Pentacostal.
