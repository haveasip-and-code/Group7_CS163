amish
A branch of the Anabaptist movement, commonly associated with voluntary abstention from electricity and other modern conveniences, use of plain clothes and head coverings, and an emphasis on farming. Their language, Pennsylvania Deutsch (not Dutch), is used at home and in church. Pennsylvania Deutsch is a derivative of German. Some Amish children attend Amish-only schools, while others attend public schools. They tend to be highly community and family oriented. The majority of the Amish live in central/western Pennsylvania, middle Ohio, and middle Indiana.
