prarie dogging
In a large, open plan, cubical filled office, this is where one inmate (or employee) stands up in his/her cubicle and looks arround. This is often followed by other office workers standing up and looking around to see what all the fuss is about, in a style reminiscent of those loveable creatures, prarie dogs. ; First coined by Scott Adams in a [Dilbert] comic strip.
