beautifully depressing
In my opinion, 'beautifully depressing' means whatever it is used to define an act or thing, that act or thing becomes so descriptive in itself that it causes you to become lessened in energetic spirits, but not in the bad way. It'd probably be the closest way to describe 'perfection' in the utter sense of the word....
