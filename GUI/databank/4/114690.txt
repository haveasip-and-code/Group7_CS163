Farragut
The suburb/town outside of Knoxville onsidered by many to be the rich area, whether thats true or not can be up to debate. The area is fairly diverse for a suburb in Tennessee, but mostly made up of white suburbanites driving their suv's and minivans picking their obnoxious kids up from school everyday. Oh, and a lot of people are soccer crazy.
