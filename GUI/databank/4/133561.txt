The third installment to the hit series, SOCOM 3: US Navy SEALs will have a much more immersive single player. It features streaming technology in which the levels will be 10 times larger, enemies will be in much more abundance, and hopefully a better framerate. ; New features include full weapon customization, an array of vehicles modified for war (hummer, SOC-R assault boat, or as simple as a truck with mounted machine gun), swimming and going underwater, new teammate commands, and 32 player online with new game modes.
