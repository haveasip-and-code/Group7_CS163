mormons
Well, mormons contrary to popular belief no longer pratice poligimy. I should know I am one we stoped praticing that back in the 1800's. And we don't all say 'freeking heck' I know I don't. And we don't always listen to crappy music thats all goody and heartfilled cause I listen Slipknot, Avenged Sevenfold, Disturbed, System of a Down exc. So all you people that are bashing a religion that you have no idea about need to shut the F*** up. And try learing about it before you bash it, we dont bash other religions I could really care less what religion you are and if I knew then I wouldnt really care you can stick to what you believe.
