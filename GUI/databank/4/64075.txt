UCSC
University of California at Santa Cruz ; A beautiful campus where people are generally great, you get around on public transportation or biking, you learn to think for yourself b/c some of the professors are completely off their rocker, and you work hard not to get pegged as 'bleeding-heart liberal,' 'wigger,' 'AzN,' 'token angry black person,' 'fascist conservative,' 'that immigrant kid that can't speak English,' or 'rich emo kid.'
