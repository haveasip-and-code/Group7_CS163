Exstarvaganza
1) The act of denying oneself television by way of timeshifting technology and then watching a veritable smorgasboard/buffet of content in one sitting, usually on the weekend. ; 2) The culmination of a week's worth of pre-recorded television being ingested in one whole chunk. ; 3) Delaying gratification of the cathode ray variety until such time as you and your significant other can feast on boob tube until your eyeballs are stuffed.
