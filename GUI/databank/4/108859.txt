DC101
probably one of the better radio stations in MD or the DC area. Plays a lot of Alternative, Hard Rock, a little bit of classic rock and everyonce in a while some hip hop such as Cypress Hill, House of Pain, and Beastie Boys. ; Dont listen to DC 101 on Saturday's after 10 pm. THey have this segment called Flounder's Mash Ups which are some of the worst mash ups of all time. Some are okay but you are more than likely to hear a bad one.
