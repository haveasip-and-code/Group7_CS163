raw prawn
From the traditional Australian expression: 'Don't come the raw prawn!' or 'Don't come the raw prawn with me!', meaning: 'Don't try to put one over me!' or 'Don't treat me like a fool!'. ; Particularly used to indicate that the listener is aware of the speaker's ingenuousness, for example where the person to whom it's directed feigns innocence or naivety. ; Etymology: ; Some sources say it is a WWII Australian Army expression. As to why it arose: one suggestion is that the reason lies in cooked prawn being more palatable than raw prawn. However, anyone from a fishing background who has handled raw prawn flesh, will know that it is limp, wet and slippery; like the sort of people at whom this phrase is directed.
