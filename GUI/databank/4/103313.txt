Wu-tang
(Method man, ghostface killa, RZA, GZA, Ol' dirty bastard, cappadonna, U-god, inspectah deck, masta killa and Raekwon.) ; One of the bestest ever rap groups to come about. They brought the East coast into the rap game, and finally gave the NWA some real competition. If you don't like the Wu-tang clan, get a freind to slap you.
