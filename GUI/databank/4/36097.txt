cherry picker
In sports, someone who prefers to take only easy shots. Mildly disparaging. ; A common example comes from basketball, in which a 'cherry picker' is a person who favors short shots, but especially a person who sits in the back court by the basket waiting for an outlet pass on a change of possession, enabling them to score easily before any defenders can reach them. ; The origins of this term may come from the notion of 'cherry picking' as attempting, or picking, only those things that are easily obtained, or only what suits your taste best, as a cherry might.
