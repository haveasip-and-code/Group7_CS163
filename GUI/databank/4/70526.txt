Houseboy
A Houseboi is a boy that is looking for a unique position for a change, a career, some even love. Many want to be a personal assistant, a housekeeper, a chief, and many other duties. In the past a houseboi would serve as assistant and some even grow into a life long relationship with their employers. For some that is taboo. Many stable couples today will take in a houseboi for the household duties and to mentor. [see also houseboi](extracted from www.houseboi.com)
