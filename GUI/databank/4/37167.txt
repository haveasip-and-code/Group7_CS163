Portsmouth City. ; A wonderful City on the South Coast of the UK. Portsmouth has two cathedrals, thus making doubly sure it is a CITY! Home of the British Navy, and containing a large amount of maritime history. Home of HMS Warrior and HMS Victory and The Mary Rose. ; Known locally as 'Pompey', this city boasts many tourist attractions, including the Spinnaker Tower, the UK's tallest structure outside of London. ; Unfortunately Portmouth's popularity has made it the envy of many of it's neighbours, causing them to spew forth unnecessary hatred and incorrect remarks (please see other entries).
