Chumbawamba
British anarchist pop muscial group. Founded in 1984 in Leeds, England. The number of members has hovered around 8-9. ; Although Chumbawamba is often brushed of as a one-hit-wonder of the 1990s, they remain a potent producer of catchy, melodic pop. Unknown to most is that their are deeply devoted political activists, feared by conservatives big and small. Self-described as 'progressive anarchists,' they have, since their founding, become the subject of countless police raids. ; A very talented and underappreciated musical outfit. You may not see them on the Top 40 again or agree with their radical leftist views, but their musical talent and political fever still inspire an admirable eye.
