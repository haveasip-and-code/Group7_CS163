set in stone
Colloquial description of an item (document, schedule, contract, etc.) that cannot be altered without great effort (and possibly some destructiveness) for one reason or another. ; Probably derived from how the ten commandments (Exodus 22:* in your bible) were produced on stone tablets, as it requires effort to modify a document that is etched into stone. ; See also [set in jello] for a good opposite.
