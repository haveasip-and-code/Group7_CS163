winter park
Playground and resting place for Orlando's old money. 1.5$ million an acre, brick streets, big trees and lots of lakes. Home of the racquet club, Park Avenue, Concours de Elegance, and the country clubby Rollins College. Laid back as only a complete lack of financial concern could bring.
