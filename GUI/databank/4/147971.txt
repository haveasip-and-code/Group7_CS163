extonym
A word that is an irregular extension or formation of an existing word in order to imply extra connotations or suggest further associations from the meaning of the root word. Like the words synonym, antonym and homonym, the word extonym is derived similarly: Ext- (extend) + 'onyma' (Greek for 'name').
