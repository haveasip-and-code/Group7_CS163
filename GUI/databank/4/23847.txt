atmosphere
One of my favorite hip hop duos. Say what you want about them being sell-outs or whatever, i don't disagree, but listen to their music and none of that has any importance. Emcee SLUG gives such raw, insightful lyrics and The DJ, Ant, gives great passion ion his beats, scratches and cuts, his music speaks for him. They get labeled as 'emo-hip hop' which is either a brilliant analyze or lazy comparisons. A great group, check them out if you want to hear great beats, and raw emotional lyrics.
