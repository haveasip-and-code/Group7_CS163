ITG
In The Groove. Created by RoXoR Games. ; A game very simular to DDR. The concept is the same except you may have to hit 3 to 4 arrows at one time. You can play Single, Double, or 2 player. Instead of DDR's ps memory slot, this has a USBdrive slot, making it much easier than formatting a PS memory card from JAP DDR Ex. to ARC DDR Ex.. ITG's songs generally arn't as catchy or as good as DDR's songs, but the steps are more fun and it's twice as addicting. Also see [DDR], [Dance Dance Revolution], [In the Groove], [Beatmania].
