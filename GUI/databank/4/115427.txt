pop-rock
pop-rock is that sort of music that you can bop to, without the same funky sound as pure pop. many people think that just because music has a bass, guitar and drums it is rock or punk. this is just silly. pop rock has to have atleast a slight essence of rock. Kelly clarkson is pop. 48 may is pop rock. there is a difference! ; often confused with 'emotional punk', which is meant to be punk about life and love, completely missing the point of punk(that it isnt punk unless its about disagreeing, being yourself, being angry and giving the big finger to people who judge you for it). emotional punk does not exist. punk is not about love and life and any good emotions. thats what pop rock is about!
