trans fat
Short for Trans Fatty Acid: An artery-clogging fat that is formed when vegetable oils are hardened into margarine or shortening. Many food companies use trans fat instead of oil because it reduces cost, extends storage life, and can improve flavor and texture. Food companies are also not required to list trans fat on nutrition labels (until 2006) even though trans fat is worse than saturated fat.
