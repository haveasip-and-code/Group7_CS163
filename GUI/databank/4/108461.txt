Untzster
Noun ; A person who behaves as if 'untz music' (club music or rave music with a strong untz-untz-untz beat) is continuosly playing in his or her head. ; Male untzsters are known to use copious ammounts of hair gel, wear square-toed shoes, and wear skintight t-shirts. ; Female untzsters or 'untzettes' are known to wear all things sparkly and to really put out. Big time. (Especially to men wearing gold chains upon their tanned and waxed chests.) ; Note: One does not have to be at or near a nightclub to be an untzster. While some unztsters live their whole lives 'untzed out,' many others will only become unzsters for a special occasion, such as a 'hot date.' (Theoretically, if wearing the proper tight green and blue striped sateen dress shirt, one could be 'unzted out' while sitting on the couch eating potato chips.) ; Also see 'Floridian'
