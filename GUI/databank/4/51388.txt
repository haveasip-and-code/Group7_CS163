Republican Logic
Logic that doesn't advertise the government coercing well-earned money of the most productive members of society onto the parasitic, welfare elements. Logic that doesn't want to punish success with high taxes, and subsidize failure with free money. In other words, actual logic, as opposed to knee-jerk, emotive liberal reasoning.
