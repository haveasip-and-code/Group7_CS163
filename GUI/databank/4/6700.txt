sage
A word originating from the popular Japanese forum website 2chan. Sage (pronounced 'sah-geh') - from the Japanese word 'sageru', refers to replying to a post using the word 'sage' in the email field in order to increase the number of replies without age-ing (or bumping) the post. This can be used as a courtesy, allowing one to quietly add comments that may not be interesting enough to warrant pushing the thread to the top. It can also be used as a way to show displeasure with the post being replied to.
