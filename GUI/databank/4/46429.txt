Kakashi
Also Japanese for 'Scarecrow', /Hatake/ Kakashi is a Jounin level ninja from the series, 'Naruto' written by one of Japan's most valuable Manga-ka Masashi Kishimoto. He is the instructor of the main characters Uzumaki Naruto, Haruno Sakura, and Uchiha Sasuke...kun. ; Though at first appearance may seem relaxed, simple-minded and... a bit of a moron at times, his abilities surpass many other shinobi. With his Sharingan Eye /Giving him the many names such as 'Copy Ninja Kakashi'/ he has been able to immitate over a thousand Jutsu (Techniques). He obtained the Sharingan eye aproximately 14 years before the start of the Naruto Series during a mission with his teammates Uchiha Obito and Rin (Mind you, one's yet to know her name) Obito, saving Kakashi's life from getting crushed under boulders himself took the full blow. Half of his body remaining. Before his death, he requested Kakashi to have his sharingan eye as a gift, seeing as the day Kakashi had become a Jounin Obito refused to give Kakashi a gift. /Earlier on Kakashi's eye had been struck and became useless/ Rin performed the operation, transfering eyes. Shortly after, Obito was lost under more rock.
