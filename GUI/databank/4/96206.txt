giggle stick
(n). One of the most annoying toys ever. Emerged from the 1970s, it was a plastic yellow stick that made a spastic sound by tilting it on end, back and forth. The first sound would be higher pitched and the second one was lower. Sounded like a cow on helium. ; It would sound like 'Ow, ewwwww...ow, ewwwww...'
