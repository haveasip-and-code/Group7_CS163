These are clumps of rich, pre-pubescent, snobby kids who can be found on Fri. and Saturday nights hanging-out directly outside of the UA movie theater. The 13 and 14 yr. old girls show up scantily-clad in preppy Abercrombie mini's in the middle of winter. The guys skate around and think they're badass.
