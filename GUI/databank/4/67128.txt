akira kurosawa
Japanese director who directed many long, arduous, BORING movies. Yuppies tend to like his films, as do people who liked (i.e. claimed to 'understand') the movie [Lost in Translation]. ; Most popular film was Seven Samurais, which, according to my parents who watched the movie in Taiwan when they were kids, was 'sort of awesome back then, but now, it's plain crap.' ; Seriously, those movies were terrible. Even that 'Akira Kurosawa's Dreams' which was in color. I kept waiting for something intresting to happen, but all that happened was a bunch of Japanese people singing. ; Avoid at all costs, rent some Godfather instead.
