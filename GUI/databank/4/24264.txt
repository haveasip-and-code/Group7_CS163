Ayrton Senna
Ayrton Senna da Silva (1960-1994) ; The most talented person ever to drive a Formula 1 race car, back in the days when there was actually competition. Raced with McLaren for six years, winning the Driver's Crown three times (1988, 1990, 1991). Known as the 'rainmaster' for his absolutely unmatchable wet-weather performance. Won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, three of which in an inferior car than his rivals. Still holds the record for most pole positions (65) despite a fatally-shortened career. Was killed in San Marino, Italy, in 1994 with Williams-Renault when his steering column snapped near the end of the Tamburello corner in Imola and crashed into the wall, which caused a suspension spring from his front right wheel to detach itself and pierce through his head.
