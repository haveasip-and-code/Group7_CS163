A bird like creature but its two wings are on its right hand side of its body. Stands very tall and proud an when in full flight, tends to fly circular in a anti clockwise direction. A prominent part of its body is its long thin beak, its also has very long razor like teeth. Only four seem to exist and it is true that one has been spotted in the St.Helens area of England.
