America or United States
A country that is accused of being rednecks, hippies, and fat bastards, and total complete idiots. Think about this though if we were idiots could i actually type like this without spelling mistakes, could we have some of the most powerful companies on the face of the earth, could we have one of the most powerful armed forces on the face of the earth. The government spends over 425 billion dollars a year on the US military, for training and weapons and some people wil have their opinions about that but its to protect us. Their budget surpasses some small countries. For example if we were idiots and fatasses would we have been able to do what we have done?, the internet, th atomic bomb, the space shuttle, services for the poor. Somebody tell me if im wrong common.
