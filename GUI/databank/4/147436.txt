Williamsburg
Williamsburg, Virginia. An extremely boring town populated by tourists year-round. Popular teenage hot-spots are Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA, and the newly-opened New Town Cinemas. Apart from being overrun by tourists, Williamsburg is a beautiful place. The few times of the year that tourists don't take over, is a blessing for local teens.
