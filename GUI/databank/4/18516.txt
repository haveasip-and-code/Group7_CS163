juxpoitation
In essence, a filler word. A word that can be placed in a sentence to either have positive or negative inflection. No specific meaning to the word itself. Often used as an inside joke or to irritate those that don't know it doesn't mean anything. Has nothing to do with [jux], [juxt], [juxtaposition], or other similar words.
