Nice Guy
1. The man women call when there bitch-ass boyfriends treat them like shit, but they would never date because they are 'too nice.' ; 2. The 'real men' who were always there for the women that they love, but always hear the following phrase. 'Sure, (insert ex-boyfriend's name here) was a total jerk and cheater, but I wanna give it another try.' See [unrequited]. ; 3. The guy in the office/classroom who catches shit from everybody, but still helps everybody out when they need him. Also, slow to anger.
