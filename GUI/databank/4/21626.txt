York
A town in Pennsylvania. It was the capital of the United States for one day, and the Articles of Confederation were written there. (But the Congressman had a horrible time staying there as they wrote it...) In the present time, York can be summed up with the words, 'laziness', 'obesity', 'boring', and 'yard sales'.
