Knox
One of the funniest movie makers on the net. Some hate him because of his fame for work that normally he has no effort making but it's very good stuff. His claymations are hilarious and so are his movie dubs, yes NewGrounds, the website he submits most of his work to is a Flash site but if you got something good and can import it into Flash, why not show it? Sometimes dubbed by hardcore fans 'King of The Portal' because of his fame on NG. You can tell how amazing he is because he made over $5000 with a DVD he sold with some of his claymations on. At the moment he is producing a full feature movies named 'KlayWorld: Off the Table' he is also going to be making another full feature movies with real looking people in instead of his famous Blue Klaymen. Also a PC game by an independent games company, Mocos is in early development. I think it's safe to say that Knox could well be the next Nick Park.
