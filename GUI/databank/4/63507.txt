earth day
A day to recognize and respect the environment, started by a republican in the 60's and now owned by middle age hummer driving gas guzzlers who once a year put on tie die shirts and gather for lunchbreak photos to absolve themselves of all environmental sins and pretend that they have a fucking clue.
