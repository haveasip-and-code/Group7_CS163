Musni
(Moose-Knee) ; A sudden, painful deflation and retreat of the [penis], most commonly during an [erection], although there are cases of musnis occurring during flaccid states. When a musni occurs, the [penis] undergoes painful tingles (as opposed to pleasant tingles, such as when your foot falls asleep), and its actions are quite like those a meerkat's when it senses danger - it retreats stealthily and silently into its burrow. ; Also like a meerkat's retreat, a musni is triggered by extreme bodily pain and/or fear.
