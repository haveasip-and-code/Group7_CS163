Columbia high school
A pit of indescribable terror and agony. It is a dreaded place... The students are strung up on ropes and chains, bodies litter the parking lots and front steps. Those who live near it have claimed to hear the ancient screams of tortured souls withing its cold walls. No one goes near it anymore, those who have, are rarely seen ever again. The lucky survivors however, can only piece together a scrambeled story.
