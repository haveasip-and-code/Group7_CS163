New Eltham
Situated next to Chislehurst, one would hope some class would be borrowed from the area. ; Unfortunately New Eltham is also surrounded by Eltham, Mottingham and Sidcup... 3 against 1 odds haven't proven to be too helpful for New Eltham. ; Ideal place for a race, a fight or a bullet hole to the head! ; If you wish to visit, remember that gold jewellery, sports wear, UK garage and the term 'AHOY BOY' are the key to survival.
