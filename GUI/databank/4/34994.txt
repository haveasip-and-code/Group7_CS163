Gill
'Gill' as in 'giving a gill' A term used around the late 80s-early 90s, possibly regional, by children as a proclamation that someone/a friend just said something incredibly stupid or incorrect, AND that they deserve to be humiliated. It was shouted as he/she simultaneously burns the back of the other person's neck with a fast horizontal rub of the hand. Similar in nature to an [Indian burn].
