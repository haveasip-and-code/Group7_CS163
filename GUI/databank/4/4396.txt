Alien Hominid
Originally a Flash game created by Dan Paladin and Tom Fulp, Alien Hominid debuted on Newgrounds in 2002 and received tons of praise. The following year, one of Dan's superiors at a game developer, John Baez, found out about Alien Hominid and decided it should become a console game. ; The console version has completely redone coding and art, it is not the Flash version. The game was released on November 22, 2004 for the PS2 and Gamecube for $30. Both critics and gamers praise it for bringing an exteremely fun, hip, and retro style of gameplay in a market trashed by 3D games striving to have the most-realistic graphics and environments.
