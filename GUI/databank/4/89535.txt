NYU
The #1 Dream School in the nation. NYU is a prestigious institution that receives more applications (usually upwards of 33,000) than any other private university in the country. Home to the best dorms in the nation, it's also notorious for its $45,000 pricetag, though a good portion of the student body is composed of celebrity children and millionaires.
