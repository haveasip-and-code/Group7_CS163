jelly bracelet
This is crazy. It is someones choice if they want to do 'what the bracelet means'. But why would you? They are plastic. come on. My parents let me wear them and don't care about the meanings. They know what they stand for and they know that i am smarter then other people. They also know that i am not stupid to go out and do something stupid over a bracelet. i have 212 of them and if they get broken then i buy more. But other then that there is no reason why people should worry about their kids doing stupid shit.
