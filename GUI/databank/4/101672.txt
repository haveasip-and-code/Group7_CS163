Save Ferris
A great ska-punk rock band out of Orange County, California that have two really good albums, one is It Means Everything in 1997 and Modified in 1999. It's been a really long time since they ever come out with something new, but Save Ferris is really talented and a great band!! Some good songs are Come On Eileen, The Only Way to Be, I'm Not Cryin' For You, and Mistaken.
