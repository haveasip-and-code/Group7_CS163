ninnies
Current/former Nine Inch Nails fans (hence, the 'NIN' part of 'ninnies') who originally met through the Net (old-school ninnies trace their roots to the alt.music.nin Usenet newsgroup, while more recent converts have been acquired through IRC, Live Journal and dating/marrying other ninnies), and who now get together periodically to consume prodigious amounts of meat, alcohol and curiously strong brownies, wear Reznor heater shirts and bondage gear, perform cutting-edge karaoke, and comandeer hotel lobbies 24/7 for shooting the bull, freaking out mundanes, making more bad in-jokes than was previously thought humanly possible, and impersonating N'Sync roadies.
