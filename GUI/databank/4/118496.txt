Karate.
Okinawan Unarmed Combat, that has been treated like shit by any one of its practictioners, not to mention the most recent ones as of the late 1980's by many a snotty nosed kid and young adult alike. ; Karate, or any unarmed form, should be treated like a gun and pile of bullets: ; WITH UTMOST RESPECT, AND DILIGENCE!!!!
