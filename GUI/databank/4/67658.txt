Franklin D. Roosevelt
One of the worst American Presidents ever to gain office. A man who based his entire campaign on saving the economy ruined by stupid people over-working corporate America then blaming Hoover, FDR took this opportunity to use fruity words to win over retards who believed him while he was really trying to make Hoover look bad. He used his political office to get people to ignore the fact that he was married to and had six kids with his slutty cousin. With stupid organizations like the NRA and the fact that he was known to spend weekends on his luxury yacht with his family sipping champagne while working class people went to bed hungry made the Great Depression last 6 years more than it needed to then eventually sending us blindly into a world war. Ultimatley a stupid, prudish, incestual, money hungry pig!
