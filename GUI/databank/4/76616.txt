bland safety
The semi-attractive girl that you're pretty sure you can take home but who you have met or have begun to conversate with too early in the evening. The proper handling of the bland safety is to break off conversation, go to a different part of the party or bar and try to find an upgrade. You must on a periodic basis do a walk by or otherwise an acknowledge her presence. If all else fails you need your bland safety and you know it.
