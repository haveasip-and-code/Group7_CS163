woolyhead
A subset of goth in the UK, deriving from Italians who turned up in the early 1990s. distinguishing featuer is the use of thick, multi-coloured hair extensions. Some males shave all but a tiny patch and then 'sprout' extensions from it. Note that black, red or white wooly extensions alone do not a woolyhead make, the wearer remains a goth.
