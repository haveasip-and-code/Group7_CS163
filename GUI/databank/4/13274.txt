Scene City, all of the teenagers go to Neckbeards on Thursday night for the shows. after school on Friday's everyone goes to taco bell and then to AMC, on Saturday everyone goes to the mall. Parents are overprotective yet so naive to whats happening in their kids lifes. There are to many police, and most of them don't do their jobs. Everyone is very blantly classified in groups. Everyone tries so hard to be different that they all end up exactley the same. Teenagers and 5-year olds can relate to things that they like. almost every kid you meet can play some kind of instrument or sing. a place that is so far from the real world that you near grow up.
