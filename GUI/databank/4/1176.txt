friendlationship
'Friendlationship' is a word that describes something more than friendship, but less than a dating relationship. My girlfriend, Angela, made it up about 4 months ago. It described the 'thing' between her and the person she wanted more with. However, the other person was too... whatever... to conceed to a relationship with Angela. Pretty much means there's courtship, but no one's ready to label it yet.
