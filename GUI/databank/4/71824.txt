Noob (2nd Definition)
Originally an (shortened) insult to newcomers in forums or internet games e.g. counter strike, the word has been stolen and is currently being used as an insult with a different meaning. It is used in certain places to describe someone who is slightly - ahem - [slow] and [ditsy]. Basically it is used to insult a pesron who makes a stupid comment or somebody who makes many stupid comments.
