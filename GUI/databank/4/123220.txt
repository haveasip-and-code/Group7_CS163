Nim-Nim
A mythical creature created by putting all four of your fingers together side by side then putting your thumb between the bottom of your index finger and middle finger to make a mouth shape. Nim-Nims usually spend the day wreaking havok or tending to their nests. They move by floating through the air and bobbing up and down at the same time. They eat monkeys because they cannot find sandwitches.
