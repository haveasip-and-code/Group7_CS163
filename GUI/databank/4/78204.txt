Groogen gorben
Origanates from the early early 16th centuary when an infamous artis named babson the 1st attempted to draw a picture of some apple fresh (a sweet desert made from apples and cream). His picture was a disaster as a Chef from France who went by the name of Jeff Gordan, Jeff sailed over to England to come and see Babson so he could tell him off because his picture was inaccurate and looked like a groogen gorben.
