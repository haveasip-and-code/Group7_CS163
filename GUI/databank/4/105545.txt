bobos
Abbreviation for [Bohemian Bourgeois]. People who were hippies in the sixties, grew out of that, got a computer, and a 70 hour work week but still wanted to be 'kinda funky' and 'see the world'. so they wear long skirts, grow a [skullet], buy veggies at the 'market' and fill their homes with overpriced expensive crap from 3rd world countries. To get that 'exotic look'.
