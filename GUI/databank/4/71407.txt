Derka Derka
Phrase ; Originally used as a bridgepoint term between the terrorist puppets and the increasingly hilarious Team of the Americas, \'Derka Derka\' has since transcended such lowly usage. ; Nowadays, it is not uncommon to hear the phrase in relation to a missed quotation. Such as \'She said, \'Derka Derka\' and then left.\' It can also be used in conjunction with the equaling transcendent term, \'Gagahgagahgahga,\' which, in and of itself, is related to the drunkeness associated with severe exhaustion. ; Ideally, Derka Derka can be used in any situation.
