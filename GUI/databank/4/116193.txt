ILL Mitch
'Russian' rapper who raps about skateboarding, his rapping, girls, coming to America. He's is rather comical although he probably doesn't think so. His English is sketchy at best and he has a Russian accent. I suggest listening to some stuff such as 'Come to USA' and 'I will win' where he raps about him winning and people being jealous. I laugh.
