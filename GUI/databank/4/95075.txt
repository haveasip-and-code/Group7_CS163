Kiriban Fishing
A term that is used when a random deviant (or SheezyArt user) stumbles on a another userpage and waits for the number of unique pageviews to reach the target number in order to get a free drawing from the person as a gift. In order to achieve it, the user must quickly screenscap the exact number of unique pageviews and send the deviant (or SheezyArt user) who set the kiriban value a note to prove it or else no reward.
