counter-culture
A misleading term coined by the music industry and MTV to trick gullible, angsty teenagers into a false sense of rebellion, either against 'mainstream' music scenes, society, or at least their parents. ; Counter-cultures can range from obscure and 'underground' (also another industry trick word) to being popular and mainstream. ; When a counter-culture becomes mainstream (such as [grunge] in the 90's and most recently, [emo]), it is still marketed as being against the mainstream although music acts of that genre might be flying off the charts. Of course this leads to the more elitist counter-culturists who follow a counter-culture just to impress their friends by following obscure, unpopular and/or cult-favorite music acts.
