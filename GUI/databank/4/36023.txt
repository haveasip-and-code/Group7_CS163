Rap
1. A style of music that apparently many people posting here dont understand. ; 2. It is a relativly new genre that started in the 70s when they rapped over breaks in Jazz/Soul (generally James Brown) over the years rap has developed with drum machines, keyboards and finally the computer. ; 3. A genre with different coasts and areas of the USA have different styles from the Party Jams in Atlanta to the street rhymes in the East Coast, Rap is a deep genre that is called crap by people that only listen to mainstream songs. ; 4. Rap is what has been used by record labels to take advantage of poor black men and give them ripoff contracts and just make them appear rich (most rappers get payed $250,000 a year) because of pressure ; PS: And no i am not black
