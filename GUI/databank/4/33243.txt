headbangers ball
Show that shows the same videos from the shittiest metalcore bands in the world over and over again for 8 minutes, followed by 9 minutes of comemercials,followed by 8 more minutes of shit, 9 minutes of commercials for 2 damn hours. videos interrupted by that faggot jamey jasta (who deserves to die,considering hatebreed is shitty). sometimes they play a good video or two, but i usually get bored with all that shadows fall and unearth they play in a constant loop and change it before anything good comes on.
