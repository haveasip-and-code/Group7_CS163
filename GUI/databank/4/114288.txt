musclehead
1. import hater ; 2. a person that thinks any other car then a USDM car is crap. ; 3. A person that does not know any thing about cars just that there car can beat any car out there because its an american car. ; 4. The usual american car driver that claims he/she beat every car out there even if no body has ever seen these cars he/she has beating or even seen this person race once. ; 5. The american version of a ricer. ; I hate it musclehead puts a flowmaster muffler tip on a car and claims it adds 50hp+ but makes fun of a ricer that slaps on a coffe can tip and claims that same crap. I love it when they add an aggressive cam and start the car up only to hear the death rattle of valves smacking the pistons. 'Slap a cam in there and slam on a flowmaster tip and that car can beat any thing'
