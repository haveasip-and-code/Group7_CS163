bloc party
A london indie band who have some pretty decent songs (banquet, little thoughts, so here we are etc.) however are seriously overrated. They are SERIOUSLY boring live, but most of their fans are quite deluded in thinking the opposite. In fact they have a lot of pretty silly fans, a lot of whom are scenesters, who don't know crap about music, and used to listen to Westlife.
