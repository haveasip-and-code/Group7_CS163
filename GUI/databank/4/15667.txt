linux
The BEST OS I've used in a long time, that piece of crap made by Microsoft (let's face it, all things Microsoft are crap, it's a good thing there is a way to run Linux on an XBox, assuming anyone would want to which they probaby would) was as unstable as hell. Linux is free, stable, can be used for home computing though not many people do as they think. Also, Linux is ideal for server applications though most college IT admins use Windows server instead because they are lame arses. My advice, go and get some blank cds and download Linux, you have nothing to lose
