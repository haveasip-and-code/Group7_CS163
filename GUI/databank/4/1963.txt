jaho
noun: ; A sadly pathetic Polish kid, who in spite of himself is massively whipped by a black girl. He is the protege of Daniel James Morse, and really has no life. He plays a lot of video games, yet when challenged, he gets smashed. He is sadly missing his testicles after his girlfriend pinched them off. That's too bad for him. Jaho has also had many excellent experiences involving education. He recently recieved a Phd (pubic hair digester) from Professor Michael Dabkowski. Other 'embarassing' moments have occured in the life of Jaho, but nothing of great note. He is generally better seen not heard, and cries himself to sleep every night. boo-hoo. ; verb: ; to be made fun of, in such a way as to resemble the likeness of Jaho. His utter idiocy is legendary and thus the verb 'jaho' was created. Normally used in the past tense, i.e. Jaho-ed.
