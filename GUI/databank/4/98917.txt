evangelion
Short for 'Neon Genesis' Evangelion which to be completely honest is a load of Japanese ripoff horseshit. ; Most of the time the series progression is like watching paint dry and the movie was GOOD IF you liked having seziures. ; Failed attempts to be original include some 'cool robots', blood, 'hot' 14 year old girls, terribly stupid references to the dead sea scrolls and screaming. ...REALLY not worth your time.
