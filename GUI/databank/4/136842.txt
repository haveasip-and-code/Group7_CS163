black friday
should be renamed 'black eye friday' due to the fact that thousands of americans forget the spirit of the holiday season by trampling ppl and giving black eyes while buyin stupid gifts that you didnt even mean to buy from stores who purposely hold sales the same day as everybody else. ; yet another example of how greedy americans are.
