breezing and bullshitting
The act of moving and speaking very quickly in a moment of desperation, usually when one is experiencing extreme anxiety, or just wants to tell another person exactly what he or she wants to hear. Basically, breezing and bullshitting means to lie up a storm in a very obvious and obnoxious fashion. If you get in a deep conversation while [yayed], breezing and bullshitting is common.
