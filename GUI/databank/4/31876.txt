dilly
In addition to the other definitions, dilly can be an adjective refering to anything good. Its original usage was in reference to marijuana such as 'yo dude do you have any dilly chronic?' but now has evolved to the point that 'dillies' are a noun referring to any type of high-grade marijuana. Also now anything can be called 'dilly' for example 'that ice-cream was dilly'
