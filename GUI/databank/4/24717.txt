city island
home of [matt bollati], sarima ali, liz borodkin, angelo labate, a few of my other friends, and a bunch of various potheads. people here do crazy stuff like skateboard off roofs into pools and smoke down at the beach and swim without lifeguards (GASP!). yeah basically it's an isolated suburb where it's safe to go out late at night because the only thing around are drug dealers and seafood restaurants.
