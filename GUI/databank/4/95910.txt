Killuminati
Pac was talking about killing illuminati. Illuminati is the elite ruling circle, the 34th degree of the Freemason click, which is a century old brotherhood of anglo-saxon protestants. He was tellin you to kill that shit. They're the cats that maintain all the inequality and oppression, supposedly. He came out with this whole theory after his prison stint, and after reading Machiavelli's 'The Prince.' Now it's on us.
