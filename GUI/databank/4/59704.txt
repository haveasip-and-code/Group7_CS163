Chrono Trigger
An RPG made by Squaresoft, where the main character, Crono, spans time to fix history and save the future from the alien life-form that fell to earth in the prehistoric ages. Although most people call it 'overrated' and 'retarded', you have to remember that this game is hardly recognized, and yet 'overrated' is used to describe it. Stop whining over it being a cool game and that it kicks ass. Aside from that, please, by all means, be specific why you hate it. And don't tell me 'akira toriyama fucked it up for us by making his cutscenese'. I'll be referring to the original Chrono Trigger because you guys have nothing else other than Akira Toriyama, who does draw good, you all just like watching dumb shows like Lupin and Yu-Gi-Oh and Cromarty High...
