Robert De Niro
One of the greatest and most respected actors of all time. He has been known for creating tough-guy roles or people that are borderline pychotic. Eventhough he's been picking crapola lately, he's still a great actor. He has been Oscar nominated several times but has one twice. (Best Actor for 'Raging Bull' and Supporting for 'The Godfather: Part II').
