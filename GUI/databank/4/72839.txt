set in jello
A description of a document (for instance, a programming schedule for a convention) that, while written or printed, is still at the given moment highly flexible and can be reshaped with little to no effort. ; Derived by analogue to [set in stone], and with lack of a better substance to set soemthing in that would require flexibility.
