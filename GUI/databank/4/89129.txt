Music that is fast and full of bass, originated in Leeds, although it a spanish name, probably meaning 'crazy house' or 'mad house'. Usually remixes of chart songs with repeated beats that jus get annoying after a while, the kind of music a [chav] listens to all the time, blasting it out from their '[bling]ed' up novas or council houses while they sit outside drinkin stella and thinking they own England. ; Silly bastards. ; Same as B-line, niche, phat fingaz, boiler house and all the other shite those tossers listen to.
