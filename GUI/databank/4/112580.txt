ain't
Originally a non-slang word, ain't began as a contraction for 'am not', as in 'I ain't stupid.' When people began to use it improperly as in 'He ain't', which should have been 'He isn't', people came to consider it improper use of language. Today, it's known to be used predominantly in the south and by uneducated people.
