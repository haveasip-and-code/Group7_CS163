Wavy Gravy
A positively [ill] classic hippy flower geezer icon. The founder of [Camp Winnarainbow] along with his wife, Jahanarah. If I wrote Wavy Gravy a theme song, it would be something like this: ; Wavy Gravy ; He's such a hippy ; I wish he lived near me ; Because we'd start a cult. ; That cult would love peace ; And would also love peanuts ; Because peanuts are delicious ; And peace tastes pretty good. ; Wavy Gravy was the emcee at [Woodstock], and has amazing life stories that can be found in his book (which can prolly be purchased at Border's or something). He has met many a friend, made no enemies, and seems to have no regrets in his life.
