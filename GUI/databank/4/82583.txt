Slope Day
A tradition at Cornell Univerisity wherein the last day before study period is dedicated to an all-day alcohol laden concert on libe slope. Bands who have played at slope day include The Starting Line, Snoop Dogg, OAR, Kayne West, and more. ; In years past, the university provided both beer and paramedics to the student body, but after the drinking age in New York was raised to 21 the availibility of alcohol has been continually reduced. In an effort to crack down on underage drinking, students now have to pass through a security check before they are allowed on the slope to make sure that they are not carrying alcohol. Students of legal age are only allowed to purchase drinks on the slop if they wear an identifying bracelet. However, most underage students manage to get dunk anyway.
