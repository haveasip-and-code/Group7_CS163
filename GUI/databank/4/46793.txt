Marvel vs Capcom 2
The fourth installment in Capcom's 'Versus' series. ; a revamped version of the old-skool street-fighter style games on speed (and probably acid too). ; Easy to play, difficult to master. ; Although unbalanced character power-wise and looked down on due to it being a 2D fighting game (with sprite quality and animation largely unchanged throughout the series) this game offers an extreme amount of longevity to those who appreciate the game for what it is.
