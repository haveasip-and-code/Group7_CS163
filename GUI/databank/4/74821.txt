H.A.T.E.
The super-right-wing political organization known more specifically as 'Humans Against The Emos'. It was formed when it's first six leaders decided they had enough of the liberal organizations' grotesque and forceful propaganda promoting such lifestyles as vegetarianism and boycotting of non-endangered animal-based products. The beliefs, methods and highest texts are based on the beliefs of the original six leaders and the current [episciple]s. Membership is open to all right-wing persons who share their beliefs, but registration is discreet and difficult to find.
