sweater girl
Warm and wonderful nightowl of a Moderator on Fark.com, whose mellifluous tones grace the Opry airwaves, the Detroit blue line--and all life in-between. Patron to pups and stray farkers, as well as hyphens, Admins and rookie Mods. ; Word has it that the girl really knows how to fill a sweater, too.
