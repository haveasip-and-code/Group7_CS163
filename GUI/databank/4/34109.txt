Rising Sun
Rising Sun is one of the most hick filled towns in Maryland located right in the middle of the biggest red neck county, Cecil County. When the people of Rising Sun aren't too busy farming, watching a little leauge baseball game, going to the drag strip, or fucking their sisters they're usually at the local KKK meeting. Rising Sun's claim to fame is that it is Marylands headquarters for the KKK and they are danm proud of it. The town is so racist that when the football coach of the high school heard they were going to play Aberdeen High School and Havre de Grace High School, which are too schools with a large majority of black students, the coach quit rather then even have to play them.
