ClemsonTalk
An internet forum for the students of [Clemson] University, and those that have graduated, but still have no life. The membership is almost entirely comprised of lonely geeks that can't get a date, so instead spend their time attempting to [pwn] each other on the boards. All of the pwning is just an attempt to give some kind of meaning or hope to their meaningless existance.
