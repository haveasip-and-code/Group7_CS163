Balfour
An unusual breed of ape that resides in Northern Ireland and the East coast of America. These creatures are often confused about they're sexuality and have been known to mate with members of the same sex and even each other making them inbreeds! They have also been known to mate with other animals and are particularly fond of mating with siamese cats. The American breed are apparently a bunch of wankers but the Irish breed are not much different. The American breed unfortunately suffer from the same delusions as all Americans and have a tendency to Masturbate over they're own country and its leader. The Irish breed are quite fond of wresting, watching sweaty half-naked and sometimes almost completey naked men grapple with each other, but after all, they are bi-curious. One of them suffers from a genetic defect known as melon head syndrome which unfortunately for him brings him a lot of ridicule as he has a melon head. ; Regards Pophead
