Polysics
The Japanese equivalent of DEVO, right down to the yellow jumpsuits. Hailing from Tokyo, Japan, the POLYSICS are one of the great hopes for the future of music. A less poppy Devo, mixed in with the aggressive sounds of the Bordeoms, trickle in the energy of the Dead Kennedy's, and topped off with the moods of Man or Astroman.
