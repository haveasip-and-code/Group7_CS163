University of Toledo
A poor excuse for a post-secondary school. While located in the nicest part of central-city Toledo (that ain't saying much), it still cannot deny its strong ghetto heritage. It is a very diverse school that is pretty representative of Greater Toledo (which can be a plus) with lots of Arabs, Blacks, and Latinos. The school is however open admission and will take any retard that can find money for tuition. It has earned its nickname 'Bancroft High' fully.
