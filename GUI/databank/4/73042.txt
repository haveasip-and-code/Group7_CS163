queenslanders
noun ; 1) Aggressive redneck dickheads with an IQ marginally higher than their temperatures. Queenslanders tend to consume a shitty beer called XXXX, follow an alien footy code called Rugby League, talk slowly in an annoying broad Aussie accent (how we used to talk 20 years ago- but then they are 20 years behind the rest of us), and say 'ay' at the end of each sentence.
