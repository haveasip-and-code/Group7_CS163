Among the few countries in the world that still openly practices racism, only that in Malaysia it is much much more serious. ; A usual scenario would be Malays enforcing the oppresive bumiputra rights which bans non-Malays from going into universities and applying to some scholarships. The Malays think they are the natives of the land and thus have the right to treat other people as immigrants although historically they themselves are immigrants from Sumatra. Despite what the UMNO politicians claim, the Chinese have been residing in Malaysia for more than 500 years and the Indians much much longer than that they can hardly be referred to as immigrants. The proper natives of Malaysia are the aboriginal tribes/Orang Aslis yet they are NEVER entitled to any bumiputra 'privileges'. Ironically instead the ingenious natives of Sabah and Sarawak who are themselves South Chinese origin are entitled to it, coincidentally because they are representated by their respective political parties in the BN. ; Even so, no other bumis have made it into unis sucessfully like the Malays. The other races, even if obtaining the best results in the country have no hope of getting a place of their choice, minimal chance if any. Even so, the unis are super-shitty and spurns out graduates who majority migrate in search of a better income (and away from the racist treatment of Malays), leaving the few 'left-overs' which possess a super-retarded level of English fluency to fill in the severe umemployment in the economic sector. As the result the economy is run by super-retarded MALAYS and if not again by the contribution of the hardworking CHINESE and INDIAN as well as the often-loathed American investors Malaysia would implode upon itself by now thanks to Malaysian Brain Drain(tm) policy invented by 'Malay genius' Mahathir.
