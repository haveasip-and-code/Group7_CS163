JBL John Bradshaw Layfield
One of the most loyal, hard-working and superb wrestlers ever to grace the WWF/WWE. Since his change to the JBL character, he has developed enormously into a major talent in WWE programming and was most deserving of his 10-month reign as WWE Champion. He truly did not deserve to lose to Cena in such a short match at WMXXI after such a great tenure.
