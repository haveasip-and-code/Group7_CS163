The Touch
An amazing short film, made in an amazingly short amount of time with an amazingly low budget. Tells the story of Lucas, and his day running from a mysterious stranger known only as 'The Touch'. Made using pirated music so illegal to exhibet publicly, but several copies of the dvd are in circulation(mostly in the Toronto area). Honestly, if you get ahold of a copy, you are indeed a lucky one.
