Clique
A clique is a coalition whose members associate regularly with each other on the basis of affection and common interest, such as listening to Mike Jones and dunking 4 fun, and posses a marked sense of common identity. All members of a clique interact with one another, though there may be core members (Jmo, Nasty, Courtney, Laura), primary members (Nate, Billy), and secondary members (Craig).
