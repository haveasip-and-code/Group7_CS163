indie
Indie kids have their own sense of every other group. They may think jocks are too dumb, cheerleaders are too whorish, emos are too pathetic or skaters are just a little out of control. They don't really fit in anywhere. Even around other indies they disagree on who is better, Death Cab or Cutie or the Snow Patrol. ; You'll find them in Urban Outfitters, watching Epert and Roeper, or at a library. ; They would rather express their own opinion, which is usually more educated than most, then try to fit into one group. This can be annoying because for the most part they are normal, functioning members of society. However, if you ever wanted to do somthing that is mainstream, such as dance at a club or play a sport, even those harmless things are too common for them. Its also a shame because they are usually educated enough to support why they like the Shins and go against the group, but they usually find flaws in everything that isn't in accordance with their own differing beliefs. ; Nevertheless, they are better than the extreme, devoted goths, skaters and chavs because at least they are down to earth and know that acting like that is gonna get you nowhere. ; The female indies usually end up being financial consultants and the male ones are usually english teachers.
