ragnarok online
An online MMORPG produced by Gravity. It can be highly addictive at times, until you notice all of the botters, spammers, over pricing vendors and idiots. A lot of 'girls' play. In fact, they are not actualy girls but just men admiring the 'cute' characters. Players have a tendency to begin thinking they are japanese and repeatedly spamming things like 'Nuuuuuuuu Baka Baka!!! Watashi Neko Mimi Nyuuu =3!!' There are other such annoying faces like 'O.o, O_O, etc.' The other 90% of players speak like they haven't even learned english.
