Xenaholic
Somebody who is completely addicted to Xena: Warrior Princess. There are different ranges of Xenaholics. Anybody who watches a couple episodes of Xena a day on DVD would be a mild Xenaholic. However, people who own all 6 seasons on DVD, spend the majority of their time watching and/or worshipping Xena, have Xena posters on their walls, walk around quoting Xena, and even comparing themselves to either Xena or Gabrielle, would be considered heavy Xenaholics. Some Xenaholics may also have interest in Hercules, and probably have a few seasons of that on DVD as well.
