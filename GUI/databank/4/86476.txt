Skop-jay
A humorous rendition of the capital city of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (also known as the Republic of Macedonia). ; It stems from the actual spelling: ; SKOPJE (pron: Skop-YEH) ; And the fact that many non-Slavs have difficulty pronouncing the later 'JE' element of the name. ; This rendition instead pronounces the 'JE' as JAY, since it almost looks out of place when spelt in English.
