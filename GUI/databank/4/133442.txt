Taurus
An all purpose car that is the best to learn to drive in, since if you hit anything it will make the car look better. Comes in sedan, or if you're lucky you'll get the wagon which seats 8 uncomfortably. Don't plan on having the car long, as it seems to have a smoking problem and only lasts till 70K (and if you say yours lasted longer you're lying)!!! People will try to pimp it out, like Brad, but he is a sissy and likes cats so it's okay.
