Brookfield
A city in southeastern Wisconsin, a super suburb of [Milwaukee]. Known for high cost of living and little else: there's not much to do, but parents like it because it has a pretty decent school district. Other Wisconsin kids think that Brookfield kids have a general 'elitist' attitude, when it's only a handful. Kids from Brookfield Central are snobby and rich, while kids from Brookfield East are more diverse: potheads, snobs, and general freaks.
