GAA head
Rural person, commonly seen around the holylands area of belfast. Obligatory cloths during the day are GAA top, tucked into levis of O'Neils bottoms. At night they emerge in check shirts, with sleeves rolled up tucked into levis and confirmation shoes. anyone not wearing this is a 'fookin faggot'. Main past-time is drinkin ['half-ins'] in renshaws and gaelic football. ; There is also a female equivalent, characterised as being overweight and wearing far too much make up. Their catch phrase is 'what club u play for boy?' HOT TIP:Very easy to pick up outside renshaws at 130am onwards, just tell them u played for your county and uv got the ride regardless of looks. WARNING:Riding one of these will result in fake tan stains all over ur sheets. ; When male version fails to pick up female version at end of the night, usually results in him beating the shite out of someone who tackled them the wrong way in their last gaelic encounter. ; Arch-enemys:soccer players(the foreign game), rugby players(the prod game), spides, and anyone who dosnt say 'boy' at the end of every sentence.
