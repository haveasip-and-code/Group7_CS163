conspiracy theory
two words which are uttered whenever anyone is getting too close to the truth ; this renders said person null and void and gives said person the appearance of a paranoid twat with a tinfoil hat regardless of what facts or evidence or actual proof they have ; these two little words [conspiracy theory] have a magical effect similar to: ; 'there is no such thing as the occult,the occult doesn't exist, ; you don't need to see any identification,these aren't the droids you are looking for,you can go about your business,move along'
