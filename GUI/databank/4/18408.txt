Axe
The best deodorant available today. ; Supposed to smell like various colognes(but with 'original' names), but in actuallity smells closer to the odor given off by the shit you take after a day-long concert. Only men have the gene that lets us realize the truth. Girls have some deficiency, most likely from overuse of cosmetics. We wear it anyway, because ; 1.it is finally a deodorant we can casually pass around the locker room without sharing eachother`s pit hair ; 2.it covers up the BO until you can get your hands on some REAL deodorant ; 3.we know that because of their missing shit-smell-detection gene, most chicks have an unexpicable attraction to it. ; DO NOT OVERUSE, OR YOU WILL FAIL AT LIFE.
