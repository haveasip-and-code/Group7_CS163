nuclear launch detected
1.Originally from the game [Starcraft] made by Blizzard. It's what happens when a ghost designates an area for a nuclear explosion from a nuke sent by the nuclear silo attatched to the command center. When you hear it and see it in its white glory words, you are seeing and hearing doom and destruction. ; 2.Derived from [Starcraft], when ever you feel gas, just go 'Nuclear Launch Detected' and the closest person next to you will run away, then you release it.
