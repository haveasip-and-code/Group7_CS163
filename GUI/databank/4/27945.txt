bogan
A bogan is someone commonly found in Australia, or to be more precise, in the island state below Australia- Tasmania. ; Bogans can be found usually residing in housing commision areas, outskirts of towns, generally highly suburban areas. They usually live in large groups of grey or red brick or besablock homes but only reside in thier own houses when they become too old or too fat or when they need to steal some of thier parents cigarettes/ money. ; There are several bogan variations,but I have decided to cover one main group; young female bogans. ; Young female bogan teens like to spend most of thier time running away from thier homes to go and 'hang out' with thier boyfriends, this is usually done when they are supposed to be at school. They usually wear tight jeans, a miniskirt over the top, a large 80's style belt, pink uggh boots, a tight shirt, a whole tube of mascara, an entire pallete of black eye-shadow, a few tubs of foundation and they usually like to have thier badly bleached hair tied up into a pony tail, although several of them have discovered that stealing thier boyfriends ford cap covers thier black roots. They are those girls that everyone in school thinks is classy, but really they end up with dead end jobs, 4 children by the age of 18, an abusive husband/s, lung cancer and several other problems.
