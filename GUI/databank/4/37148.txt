f00
Derived from computer music ([tracker]) code. The 'f' represents speed and '00' means that the song (actually pattern) stops. ; So basically there's also my redefinintion for the rock band [Foo Fighters]... I don't think they're 'fighting the fools', but rather 'fighting to keep the music playing' or something in that direction ;)
