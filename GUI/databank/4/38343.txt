ROTFLMAO
An overused, stupid, useless, pointless, fucked up, acronym for 'netspeek' that, no longer, means anything. Surprising they can't even say 'lol' when they laugh. They NEVER roll on the floor. They just type it to make them seem cool. Same goes for 'lmao' and 'lmfao.' Dont give me that bullshit about taking it 'literally.' ITS WHAT IT STANDS FOR. HOW ABOUT YOU GROW THE FUCK UP AND NOT BE A TOTAL FUCKING MORON ON THE INTERNET. Thank you.
