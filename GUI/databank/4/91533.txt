Patrick
A common name for a male child. The etymology of the name reveals that the name means [noble]. And in the case of Patricks everywhere, they are quite noble indeed. A Patrick's personality can only be described as charming, outgoing, infectious, hilarious, daring, exciting, brilliant, and very unique. Patricks, whether young or old, always tend to attract the attention of the public with their gorgeous looks. The only quality that a Patrick lacks is self-control--especially when it comes to the drink. Patricks are known for their love of drink, no matter what it is.. as long as it has [alcohol], which is why every Patrick's favorite holiday is St. Patrick's Day of course.
