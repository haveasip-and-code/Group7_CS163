Flaming Tequila
A tequila that has been set on fire. The way to drink a flaming tequila is best done by way of a staw. ; First, one sticks the straw into the burning alcohol and must suck up all of the tequila before the straw melts. This is chugging and makes you drunk pretty fucking quick. But if you're slow as hell the fire might shoot up your straw and, not burn, heat up your mouth. ; The second way of doing is is holding the shot glass above you and pouring it into your mouth. Hopefully the fire will die out by the time it hits your tongue... Hopefully.
