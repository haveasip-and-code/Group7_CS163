Contaxian
One who prefers cameras which are no longer in production, had a good run only with some of their cameras, and are not really all that notorious. Also likes to stereotype Canonites and Nikonians by calling them amateurs, when in fact, and usually in general, they have far better bodies and lenses than the Contaxian.
