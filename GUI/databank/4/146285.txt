kooch
A game involving a koosh ball. The players stand in a circle and throw a ball at each other trying to make others miss. If one drops the ball, they are out. Ends in a showdown between two players with throws resembling baseball pitches. Best if played outside, optimal for camping trips because all that is needed is a koosh ball. The name stems from koosh (the ball). Developed into kooch as the inventors were a group of men out of contact with women for two weeks.
