Stoned Slackers
Viewing Audience of The Daily Show, according to [Bill O'Reily]. Studies have shown that contrary to O'Reily's position, viewers of [The Daily Show] are obscenely better informed and more well educated than viewers of O'Reily's show on Fox News. Rather than being evidence that [marijuana] is good for you, this is merely evidence that [Fox News] is for [idiot] [freepers], and that a 'fake news' comedy show is more educational than [The O'Reily Factor].
