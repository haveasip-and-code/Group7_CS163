Semper Fi
Semper Fi, adopted in 1883, is the U.S. Marine Corps motto. It's short for Semper Fidelis, which is latin for 'Always Faithful.' To many Marines, Semper Fi, is not just a phrase but a way of life-the commitment that they all share to their community, to their Corps, and to eachother. It's why there are no ex-Marines, only former Marines.
