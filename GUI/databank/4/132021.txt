bag team all-american
A term used to describe an individual who is ridiculously over-zealous in any of his or her pursuits, often in a comedic and destructive way. These individuals are easy to point out in a crowd and are noticeably more agitated, sweaty, and loud than a normal person. The term evolved from high school football where 3rd string 'bag team' players would injure starting running backs by being overly aggressive during Friday half speed practices.
