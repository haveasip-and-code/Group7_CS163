Pete Best
The drummer in the Beatles before Ringo Starr. He was kicked out of the band right before they got famous, 'cause Pete Best sucks a drumming. Nowadays, he's touring with his lame-ass band, and maintaining his bakery. He thinks he's all famous 'cause he was in the Beatles for like 2 years, but that fact is, HE SUCKS. PETE, IF YOU ARE READING THIS, PLEASE REALIZE THAT YOU ARE NOT FAMOUS, YOU DID NOT CONTRIBUTE ANYTHING MAJOR TO THE BEATLES, AND YOU SUCK ASS.
