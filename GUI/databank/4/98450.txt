Doom cookie
N; ; 1. Someone who evidently attempts to dress as a [goth] while being largely oblivious to the actual subculture as they're too smitten by all the nifty black spiky things they can buy to make them look mysterious and nonconformist at [Hot Topic]! ; 2. Someone who's newly thrust themself into the gothic subculture without a clue as to what it stands for, usually marked by a lame wardrobe, the writing of terrible poetry mentioning blood and broken mirrors at least twice, a newly acquired cutting habit, and several recently failed half-assed suicide attempts. ; 3. Someone who decides to pose as a goth for no reason beyond wanting to look like a more interesting person, usually unbeknownst to them (the average doom cookie thinks s/he isn't one), but gives themself away immediately with their obnoxious or ridiculously overdone gloomy personality and an unnatural affinity towards being repeatedly raped by Hot Topic's prices in order to own 5 more pairs of bondage parachute pants.
