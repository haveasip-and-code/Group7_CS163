Buddah in the backseat
Someone who is so in touch with who they are, someone so uneffected by outside forces, someone who spreads as much good karma as possible, and someone who is so peaceful and kind that people say that they've got Buddha in the Backseat. It takes a cultured and uneffected person to earn this status.
