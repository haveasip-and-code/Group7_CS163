The Easy Mac Paradox
derived from the frustrations of Hannah and Kristin, two first year college students living in the dorms and surviving on bland dorm food and the popular Easy Mac by Kraft foods. ; Refers to the frustrating situation one encounters when attempting to satisfy hunger and craving with the Easy Mac snack. ; The Paradox: One can eat one packet of Kraft Easy Mac and still be a little bit hungry and craving more of the cheesy and delightful snack, yet if one prepares two packets in hopes of avoiding this hunger and craving at the end of his snack, he finds himself fully overwhelmed by the cheesiness of the snack that the craving seemingly dwindles even before one packet has been devoured. ; Either be left wanting more. Or disgusted too soon. You just can't win with the Easy.
