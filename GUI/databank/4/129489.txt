layne staley
Layne Staley was the lead vocalist for the grunge-rock band Alice In Chains. He was also grunge-rock music's best vocalist EVER. Hands down. Kurt Cobain sucks compared to Layne. Layne died of overdosing on Herion and Cocaine in 2002. Layne Staley led a hard life, dealing with his parents' divorce, battling drug addiction and having to suffer through the death of his girlfriend, Demri Parrot. Rest in eternal peace, Layne. You are dearly missed, Layne, and will be remembered for a long, long time...
