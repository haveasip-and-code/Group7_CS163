Yu gi oh
1) A card game, manga, and anime that are a complete waste of time, money, and technology. Involves characters/players yelling at each other about cards that don't matter, taking away Life Points that don't really matter, either, and generally only appeals to eight-year-old boys. ; 2) Perfect material for an anime music video to Barenaked Ladies' 'New Kid (On The Block).' If anyone ever finds this video, they MUST watch it.
