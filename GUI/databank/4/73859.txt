Worcester
(n) second-largest city in Massachusetts. Not much to see from the highway, but the city actually has some beautiful old neighborhoods, affordable housing, good schools, and a comparatively low crime rate. It is also a no-frills industrial wasteland, very Lovecraftian in parts. Famed for its diners, punk scene and attitude. Nobody here wants to hear any crap from YOU, understand? good. Dollah-fifty.
