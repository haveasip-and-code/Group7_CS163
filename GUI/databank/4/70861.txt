Tom Clancy
Dog shit novelist extraordinare. All his stories are about terrorist or communists getting their asses whomped by the 'free', democratic western countries. Even though his stories are generic and boorish, they do make for mildly entertaining movies (Hunt For Red October), and pretty decent videogames (Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, etc). ; Even though his stories are mostly shit. His success is quite high. His obscene crap-to-money ratio amazes us all. So Tom Clancy, for that, I salute you. ; In fact. One man (Maddox) proved once and for all that anyone can make a storyline which equals anything Clancy can write. Don't believe me? Just check it out under 'Five shitty movies that everybody loves' at www.thebestpageintheuniverse.com, at the bottom of the page is the 'Tom Clancy Plot Generator', using this, I have created a plot just as good as anything Tom Clancy could make:..
