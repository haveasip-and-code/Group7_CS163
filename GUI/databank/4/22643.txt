Reggie Roby was an All-American punter at the University of Iowa and the Miami Dolphins. He was so good in fact, that he often outpunted his coverage. Well there are many ugly, dorky looking guys with girlfriends that are way too hot for them. Therefore, they are outpunting their coverage and should be called Reggie Roby.
