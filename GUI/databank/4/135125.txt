bushmen
An ethnic group of people living in Botswana who traditionally live by hunting and foraging. In recent years their land has been stolen by the government of Botswana and sold as diamond mines. The rate of AIDS and alcoholism since their relocation is astounding. The Bushmen are becoming victims of genocide and greed.
