k-os
IMO and in many, the best Canadian rapper. Breaking away from the treachery of commercial hip hop and money making artistry, he excels the art to a form that is most earthly, and real. He can bring heavy NY sounding hip hop in one track, then soulful guitar (played by him) blues in another. A true artist in a world of few.
