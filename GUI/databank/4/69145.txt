Tobinator
1. One who leaves a trail of death & destruction. 2. To believe you have the inside track with God and that your cause is infallable and just. 3. To be a narcissistic [disingenuous] [four flusher]. 4. To wear a smile while stabbing an unsuspecting friend in the back. 5. The only experience worse then a Tabasco enema.
