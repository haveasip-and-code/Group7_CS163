indianola
The pimpenst town in Iowa, which is actually not that much of an accompleshment because theres about 50 cities in IOWAY. Indianola is the coolest because we have the most down in dirty celebration, THE BALLON FEST. Theres lots of hot chicks here. We got national attention on Paul Harvey a couple of years back becase of the 'native americans' thinking Indianola Indians (our HS sports team) was offensive. We still have then and love them. The Indianola basketball and XC teams are adored by many Iowans. ; The only problem with this place is our [duche bag] vice princeball Mr. O'Mera
