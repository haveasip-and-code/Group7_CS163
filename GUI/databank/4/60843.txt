Kev
A kev is a total twat who thinks he's it. He usually wears trainers with springs on them (Called Nike Shox) and Scottish Kilt clothing like Burberry. They have a huge vendetta against rockers (who rule may I add:-D)and will get any chance to start on them. They are scrawny and scatty little tramps who think theyre 10 ft (theyre really 4ft) tall and 250 lbs and usually start on u when theyre with a group of friends. For example - Year 8 boy, 4ft 6ins 'Yo star! You biggin up to me?' you are a 5ft 6ins guy - you dont need to. ; You have to admire these kids in a way - there bravery, courage, lack of dick, lack of strength and of course, referring to my example, lack of height. If you know anyone hoo is indeed, a kev, use this definition to make him realise his place
