Flamealchemist
An annoying yet funny member of thesato, flamealchemist was inspired by [Vashyro]'s 1337ness to pick up the bass. Flamealchemist worships [Vashyro] like god and voted for him aswell. He would consider himself [Vashyro]'s eternal rival, but is nowhere near as 1337. He gets an F in PE and wants to become a Senator.
