Cocktail consisting of 2/3 Olde English malt liquor, 1/3 orange juice. You can also throw a little dark rum on the top for that extra 'bam!' This drink is also commonly known as [Brass Monkey]. This drink is called [Daytons] on [Crenshaw], because you will find this cocktail in almost any car on Crenshaw Blvd that is rolling on Dayton spoke wheels.
