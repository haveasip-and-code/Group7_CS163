DCU
Famously dull and boring university in Dublin, jam packed full of dull and boring students. ; In DCU its still cool to put a street cone on your head when youve had a few drinks. ; The students are scared of the locals for no reason other than sheer [culchie] ignorance, and wont even drink in the local pub, The Slipper, for fear that some knacker will start a fight with them, which is unlikely considering the clientel isnt bad in The Slipper. ; DCU from above looks like a town from a Phantasy Star game [sega][megadrive]
