flawn
The most foul scent known to man. A strong mix of old man, molding food you found under your couch from god knows when, cottage cheese, and an overheated junior high classroom. ; To be told you smell like flawn is the worst of all the smelly smells out there. It's a serious hint that you need to bathe using SOAP. ; The less flawn there is in this world, the better off we'll all be.
