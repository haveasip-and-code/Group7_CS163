Calvary Chapel Time
noun: a time zone found in Calvary Chapel schools which throw off all plans of meeting friends and being on time to important events on time. Can be found frustrating when used as an excuse for being late to school, and you recieve a lovely little yellow slip after all efforts to get out of being late.
