New Castle
A small town in Northern [Delaware]. Also know as 'The Castle' it consists of shitty little mid to low class neighborhoods full of drugs and 'white trash'. Directly linked to [Wilmington], New Castle gets worse the closer to Wilmington you get. Women who live in New Castle are often reffered to as 'New Castle Girls', and believe me, it's not a good thing. New Castle girls are said to be floozies or crack heads, whichever you prefer. The only really good thing about New Castle is Battery Park, (a good place to either make out, get high, or both!) If you get hungry, try the Dog House for one of their famous foot long hot dogs, then leave New Caslte right away and go someplace better.
