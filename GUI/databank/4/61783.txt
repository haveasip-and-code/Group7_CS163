Grey Fox
1. Said to be the most clandestine militray special operations unit in the world, they're main role is S&C (sweep and clear, AKA: Search and Destroy). They are said to insert covertly into their AO (Area of Operations; which at the present [2005] is still Iraq) and search out specific marks, cards, or other military personnell. ; There is VERY limited information on this unit. They are said to be all american, controlled by the Pentagon, maybe SOCOM (Special Operations COMmand). They are also said to be a section of Task Force 20. ; I infer them to have been previous SOF soldiers, and they would most likely be mercenaries or black ops, for the lawless activities they engage in.
