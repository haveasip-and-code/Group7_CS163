MegaTokyo
Webcomic created by Fred 'Piro' Gallagher and Rodney 'Largo' Caston. After the two fail to get into E3, Piro (anime otaku/japanese dating sim fan) gets a drunk Largo (hardcore gamer/l33t h4x0r m4573r) on a plane to Japan, where they soon find themselves stranded. Eventually, they form relationships with the people around them and find themselves caught in both the struggles to fit in and to get home. An excelent webcomic, though those seeking purely humor may want to visit another comic, such as Penny Arcade.
