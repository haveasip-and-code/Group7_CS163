pochismo
Word used in Mexican Spanish to describe a state of being 'pocho.' Pocho is a derogatory term that Mexicans use for American hispanics who can't speak Spanish correctly. Also used to describe someone who says he's bilingual, but in reality can't function in either language.....like Tex-Mex.
