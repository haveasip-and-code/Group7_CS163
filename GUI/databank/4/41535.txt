bilbo
For whatever reason, a bilbo became the name given to an individual who wasn't given much chance of survival during games of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. For added humililation, the name was pronounced in a low voice with the emphasis on the O. Also used to designate an NPC who was clearly about to die in a poorly disguised plot twist.
