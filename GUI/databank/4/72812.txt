Perry Hall
This used to be a place of prestege... People wanted to live here until they started shipping trash in from essex and the city... now its full of little white wanna be 'gangstas' who think their hard core. They like to take their 'bitch' to the mall or even high class the Avenue. If their lucky their mom will pick them up BEHIND Loews at 12...
