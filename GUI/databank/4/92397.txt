raggare
A subculture in Sweden inspired by the whole 1950-60s American rock n' roll, hot rod, 'greaser' concept. ; Raggare are a lot like American biker gangs and motorcycle clubs: They mostly consist of young or middle aged rural 'redneck' types clad in denim and leather and even wear mullets and facial hair, drink heavily and are believed to be violent although the main difference is that raggare center their obsession more on cars rather than motorcycles. ; They also had rivalries with hippies and punks often resulting in fist fights.
