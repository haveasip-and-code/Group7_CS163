Punisher  The
One of the best video games EVER made. Based on the comic book of the same name, 'The Punisher' was a Capcom CPS-1 game that hit arcades in 1993, and would be released on Sega Genesis the following year. ; Oddly enough, the game also features Nick Fury, who starred in an entirely different comic book.
