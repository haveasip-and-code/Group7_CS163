K20
The Acura/Honda engine code for the i-VTEC RSX, Civic Si (2001+) and 4th gen Integra (JDM). With 6 gears & 200 hp from a only 2 liters in the USDM RSX Type-S and 8000 rpm redline, it can be made very powerful thru all-motor, nitrous, super or turbocharging. It can be swapped into light Civics, Del Sols and even CRX's, making a 12 sec. car with simple intake/header/exhaust and ECU tuning!
