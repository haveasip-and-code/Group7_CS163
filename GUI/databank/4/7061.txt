Republic
a goverment that has its roots in Sparta but became more effective type of goverment when rome combined a sparta type Republic whith a greek type Democracy.a Republic was orignaly verry effective of makeing sure a country stayed together the only problem happened is when it is combined with a Democracy. When this happens a country can split in half and go into civil war which has happened to Rome and America.Republics although the idea is outdated and very old it is still effective and is used still by the most powerfull country in the world the USA(in a millitary sense but by no means political or economic).
