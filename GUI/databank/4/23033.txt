Yellow Belt
When a person urinates upon any part of their sexual partner(s) body, for the first time. Once urination is conducted the person will have his/her yellow belt. A yellow belt may be given by a panel of peers to those who piss on their partner who has no knowledge the act is actually taking place; proof must be provided from the partner, who is being pissed on, typically stemming from when they realize what is actually happening, and then they can confirm the occurrence to the panel of peers.
