plate-in-lip boobs
Also known as 'National Geographic Boobs', plate-in-lip boobs are large, droopy breasts often with a dark ariola (sometimes referred to as the 'titty circle'). Plate-in-lip boobs can be brought on by quick and overzealous weight gain, pregnancy or old age. A woman with plate-in-lip boobs normally desires the look of a more lofty sweater kitten and can acheive this with either duct tape and Ace bandages or extensive plastic surgery.
