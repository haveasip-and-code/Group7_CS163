sciffle
To create a noise a noise with the lungs and mouth - starting with 'k', then proceed immediately with the German pronounciation of 'ch', and finally (keeping tongue hovering below the roof of the mouth and teeth clenched) suck the air back into the lungs. Repeat last two stages in rapid succession. The resulting sound should be akin to cute hyperventilation, or a high pitched giggling without the use of the vocal chords. ; Sciffling is most often used as a sign of delight or frustration, depending on the facial expression that accompanies it. ; Origin: Aberystwyth, Wales
