forfucksake
A word used in substitution for 'forgodsake' it is mainly used by those afraid of hellfire because they prefer to never take the lord's name in vain. Of course the holiest of rollers will prefer 'forgoshsake' or in a pinch even 'forcrapsake' but sooner or later there will come a time when they are so utterly shocked by some dumbass or even some dumbass's elephant that none of the milder forms of this word will suffice.
