Jerry Falwell
Prominant Public face of the '[Religious Right]'. ; Jerry Falwell started the famous, 'Moral Majority' which helped establish christianity as a political lobying group and helped get Regan, both Bushes, and many other politicians elected. ; Founded [Liberty University], the largest Christian University in the USA. Basically runns Lynchburg Virginia. ; Jerry Falwells face frequents Crossfire, and Donehue as well as many other mediums such as Fox News, Daystar, and The Old time Gospel Hour. He's known all ; around as the most outspoken and 'on the wing' conservatives in America. ; As only Christian on Television who is willing to say what nobody else has the gutts to, he getts alot of flack for saying alot of bold statements such as, 'Mohamid was a Terrorist', and '911 happened becasue of the evils of America like sex on TV, abortion, and [Homosexuality].' ; The terrorists bombed us because our society offends their sense of morality and it probably offends God too. Not because Jerry Falwell says you're going to Hell. And if you have a problem with him saying that, Either ignore it, because its not true, or if it is true, do something about it and turn to Jesus and stop your complaining. Like Jerry Falwell says, 'None of you have to go to hell unless you put yourself there. Jesus is knocking on the door of your life. Won't you let him in?'
