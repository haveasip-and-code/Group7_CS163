Sprunk
Sprunk, a type of soda pop found in Grand Theft Auto games, especially San Andreas (but also Vice City; check out the Kaufman Cabs headquarters, there's a vending machine there) is a parody of the carbonated lemon lime drink Sprite. Sprunk comes in a grenade-shaped can hence the marketing tagline, which says it has an 'explosive, bursting flavour'.
