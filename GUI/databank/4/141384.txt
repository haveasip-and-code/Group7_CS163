jack sparrow
A fictional pirate from the adventure film 'Pirates of the caribbean.' ; Portrayed by Johnny Depp. ; Part of the inspiration for Jack sparrow, says Johnny, was Pepe le piu and Keith Richards. He has a saunter and a generally camp way of being. ; The character of Jack sparrow is a rougish, dishonest man who's willing to do anything to get his way. His sole ambition in life is to get back 'The black pearl' a ship he was captain of until a mutiny in which his older first mate took over the ship. ; They marooned him on an island and left him to rot, lukily for Jack the island was a stop for rum smugglers. After spending three days on the beach drinking said rum he bartered passage off the island. He then made his way to Tortuga and met a young fishing girl called Anamaria. He also gained himself a reputation at the local brothel albeit a not very good one, at least not with Scarlet and Gisselle. Still I'm sure Jack was a very steady customer. ; Eventually he stole Anamaria's boat 'The jolly mon' and sailed to the neighboring Port royal. It was then his intention to commondere a ship, find himself a crew in Tortuge rape, pilage plunder and other wise pilfer his weasly black guts out. ; This is the point where the film starts. ; Jack sparrow is far more than has been written by drooling fan-girls. ; He is a hilarious and colourfull character whom is worth far more than 'He ish soooo hawt! *Drool*' posts.
