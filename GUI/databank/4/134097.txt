Pocho
Pocho means americanized Mexican, or Mexican who has lost their culture. (Which largely refers to losing the Spanish.)It is a derogatory term can be someone who's trying to 'act white' but it has been largely embraced by Chicanos with a sense of defeatist humor - We're pochos, y que? - so that it's actually becoming more playful than bitter. Kind of like, among blacks, 'Whas up Nigga'. ; The tension over pocho/non-pocho can trace back to Mexican history and [La Malinche] who was a traitor to the indigenous Aztecs and birthed the first mestizo - hence the Mexican insult [Hijo de La Chingada]. Mexican philosopher Octavio Paz wrote extensively on this theme.
