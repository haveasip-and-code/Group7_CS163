shiet
The creator, Brian Nho of Windsor Ontario Canada, is an AzN who loves Gangsta rap. Saying [shit] wasn't good enough for him, so he created a word that could be elongated and was more 'gangsta.' The word was shiet, and it is pronounced 'Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-it' and often used in the phrase 'shiet homey.' No real meaning, and hilarious when Asians say it.
