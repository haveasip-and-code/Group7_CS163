Letterman
Pretentious fuck whom many people find amusing in a 'I'm semi-conscious because its five past fuck-knows-what-hour and hey here's some late night TV - oh this guys funny, but only because my brain is concentrating most of its energy on digestion' sort of way. Characteristics of the Letterman include [corny] predictable jokes, cabaret music, [boring] [celebrity] guests and a good old wank. Apparently the Letterman likes his studio nice and cold, so when a journalist asked why it was so cold in there some PR person was all grovelling-like 'because Letterman likes it that way' - what sort of self-centered fucking bullshit is that? Do you control the fucking atmospheric temperature now as well as the airwaves between 3 and 4 am?
