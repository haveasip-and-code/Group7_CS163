Joe Cocker
The greatest British soul singer fo all time. He toured as Joe Cocker and the Grease Band for a while. His biggest songs were the Beatles 'With a little help from my friends', 'Feelin' Alright', 'The Letter' and 'Love Picked us up'. The last one is his most annoying. It was for the movie 'An Officer and a Gentlemen'. It's jsut a really sappy song, but the rest are just kick ass!
