Colorado Springs
Colorado Springs is a decently sized town in Colorado that is about 80 miles south of Colorado's capital, [Denver]. There is absolutely nothing to do here, unless you're over 21, but still. There are movie theaters, and two stupid malls. Oh ya... Skate City. C-town (as we like to call it) is popular because it is right by Pikes Peak and Garden of the Gods is here. (Anyone up for hiking?) And Colorado's biggest Evangelical church is here, New Life Church. It is also home to millions of teenagers who have no lives, so they make one on myspace... because there's nothing to do in Colorado Springs. Oh, yes, and it's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. And it is notorious for uber fast weather changes.
