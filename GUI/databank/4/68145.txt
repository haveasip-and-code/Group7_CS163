bozone layer
The so-called 'Bozone layer' is a thick, impenetrable shroud of bozone that surrounds all intelectually challenged people. When an bozone layer appears, it is hard to get rid of, and on the contrary it grows, blocking out all intelligent thoughts from reaching the victim. Though many tests have been performed, we have yet to discover a substance which creates bozone holes.
