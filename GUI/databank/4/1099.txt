They're an awesome band! the album absoulutely rocks and i definately don't regret spendin my last tenner on it! Anyone who hates them has absoulutely NO taste in music! So all in all they're brilliant but I do suppose they could be cuter-but hey who cares about that when they've got bags full of talent!
