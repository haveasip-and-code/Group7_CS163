Comic Creator
A great program that lets you layout Comic Strips of your own. It has presets of multiple characters, each with it's own set of poses and expressions. You pic the image that you want and lay it out on screen with a wide selection of backgrounds, props, space ships and settings. You can then setup a slideshow and view your finished comic.
