iPod Shuffle
Not the poor person's iPod! Doesn't go fucked up as easy, you can actually re-create the iPod ads and not fuck the damn thing up, NO ONE WILL ACTUALLY LISTEN TO OVER 1,000 SONGS!! So shut up to all of you who go 'It can't store up to 1,000 songs! Its shit!' Nobody fucking listens to that many songs so shut the fuck up, if anyone says its the 'poor' person's iPod, then why do I own one!? I'm rich and I could buy 5 Nanos but I prefer the humble shuffle better! Shove it up yo ass sideways and smoke it! I'm not blowing a shitload on some MP3 that after a month will look like a piece of shit cause' of the scratches.
