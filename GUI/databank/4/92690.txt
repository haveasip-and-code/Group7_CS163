Dane Cook
Dane Cook is not remotely funny, yet his extreme body language appeals to a surprisingly large audience. He is obnoxious and unable to string together logical bits of humor. A man of Italian-Irish heritage, somehow Cook was selected to host Saturday Night Live (2005) and was given a Comedy Central Special (2000).
