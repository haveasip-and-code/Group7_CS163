Guitar
sometimes used in art (like picasso paintings) guitars have influenced music since the beginning of the western world. closely related to a predecessor, the lute, guitars consist of 6,7,or 12 strings (i once saw a 42 string guitar..it was nuts) as far as acoustic guitars go, the best acoustic money can buy is either a C.F. Martin, or a Takamine. As far as electrics go: Fender, Gibson, or Paul Reed Smith (PRS) the strings are strummed or plucked either with the bare fingers or a plectrum (pick) to create a pleasing array of tonal masterpieces.
