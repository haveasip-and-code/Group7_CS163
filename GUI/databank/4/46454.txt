bung hole
The hole in the side of a wooden keg used to fill said keg with beer. The Bung Hole is then stopped shut with a bung and hammered in place with a bung hammer. ; Despite its often misrepresented confusion with the Anus, bung hole is a perfectly useable word at state dinners with the governor...If you of course are in the study of fine spirits.
