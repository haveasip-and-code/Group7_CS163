LACKEN
LACKEN is a sorority at Oakton High School which is composed of some of the hottest senior girls. They are known for partying, drinking and smoking cigarettes. They are most likely the only girls in high school who buy and actually drink their own beer. You probably see them at every party you go to and they travel in groups of 5 or more. Each of their names makes up a letter in the word LACKEN. They are the 'baddest' clique of high school girls around.
