horsification
A word that was coined on a brilliant essay that receieved a 1 during the 1993 AP Literature exam. The student who wrote this essay asserted that since May Swenson's human speaker from 'The Centaur' assumed horselike attributes rather than human ones, the word 'personification' was irrelevant, thus 'horsification' took its place.
