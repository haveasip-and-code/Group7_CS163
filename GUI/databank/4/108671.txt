downward spiral
This term describes a depressive state where the person experiencing the downward spiral is getting more and more depressed, perhaps due to causes unknown. It is called a downward spiral because there is no way to stop it, its just going to get worse and worse... until the person crashes, and maybe finds their way back to happiness.
