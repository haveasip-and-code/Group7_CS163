Derek Smart
Derek smart is one of the most notorious and loathed game developers around. In addition to being the designer of the critically shunned games BC3000, Universal Combat, et al. he is also credited for starting or continuing numerous [flamewars] in Usenet and on web-boards all over the internet. His legacy of designing awful computer games and then crying foul when people tell them they are unplayable has led to many humorous statements, catalogued at a site called 'The Flamewar Follies' (google it). If he spent half of his time and energy developing decent, stable games that don't crash to the desktop every 5 seconds, rather than threatening to sue or filing frivolous law-suits against his critics, then he would be a half-decent game designer. Unfortunately, as anyone who has played any of the BC series can tell you, this is clearly not the case. Aside from 'graduating' from a non-accredited community college, Mr. Smart claims to have a phd in computer science, although no dissertation or thesis exists to back up his false claims.
