ruby animal
Rare close relative of homo sapiens, always in the female form. Curvacious and sexy, the Ruby Animal can be found in her lair constructed of duvet and pillows surrounded by the crumbs of recent hunter gathering finds which are usually fed direct to her by the mate. ; Ruby Animals constantly need attention- kissing, petting and stroking are common requests never denied for fear of violent reprisal or retention of sexual activity. ; Postcoital activities will be held back by 'five minutes' as she makes recovery.
