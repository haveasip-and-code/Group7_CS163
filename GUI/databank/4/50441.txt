scientific consensus
Translation from scientist to normal person speak: We honestly have no fucking idea. ; Sometimes, even scientists don't know what's going on. At times like that they tend to act like everyone else, which is that they assume the most popular idea must be correct. Unfortunately, this is sophistry, not science.
