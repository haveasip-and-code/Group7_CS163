Alain Prost
Undoubtedly one of the best Formula 1 drivers, scoring second among most wins, behind Schumacher and just ahead of Senna, although Senna's career ended prematurely. Greatest rival of Ayrton Senna and vice versa. Debuted in F1 with McLaren in 1980 and stayed with McLaren up until the end of 1989, leaving because he felt Senna was getting more attention and admitted to hating Senna. Won the World Championship four times, three with McLaren (1985, 1986, 1988) and once with Williams (1993) in the best car of the year by far. Retired after winning the Championship in 1993 and regained his respect for Senna especially after his death in 1994 and said that he would never sit in a Formula 1 car to show his respect.
