Adamlance
Any prolonged [LiveJournal] fight that includes the principal parties and their extensive networks of allies. Often, an Adamlance will utilize the posting of comments by the different participants as a way to argue, harass, and gossip about each other. Such battles have been in existence since the beginning of LiveJournal, but the term Adamlance came into popular usage in the Mid-Michigan area after an especially visceral fight between Adam Lamblin and Lance Ferris.
