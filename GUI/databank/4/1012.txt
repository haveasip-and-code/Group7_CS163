Jet
One of the greatest bands ever. People always seem to criticize their music too much even if it does sound like other people's. OH FUCKING WELL! The band rules, get over it. Look, rock, I believe, is a dying breed. ''C'rap' is unfortunately taking over. Jet reminds me of the good ol classic rock days and if there were more bands like Jet relighting the flame of good music (or actual music at that), rap would not be a problem.
