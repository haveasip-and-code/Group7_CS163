notblog
Naming your [weblog] 'notblog' is a desperate attempt to state your blog isn't really a [blog]. This [paradox]ical method was previously used by Asa Dotzler of [Mozilla] in his blog, but he himself had acknowledged that his notblog must be a blog after all. ; Likewise, the act of keeping a notblog is called 'notblogging'.
