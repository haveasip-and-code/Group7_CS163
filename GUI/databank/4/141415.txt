lesbianity
Lesbianity is a polytheistic religious movement which its sole purpose is to worship the relationship between two or more women. It shares many aspects with ancient Greek mythology, which is why followers of Lesbianity think the Greek island of Lesbos to be their sanctuary. Its main goddesses are believed to be Sappho, Artemis and Aphrodite. ; The official church of Lesbianity began in 2003 in London, UK, while The Pope (official name of the highest function within the church of Lesbianity) was visiting the city. The official site of lesbianity is lesbianity.org
