cornbread fed
Adjective used to describe someone, either male of female, that is thick in build but not necessarily muscular. When referring to females, it applies to thick thighs and calves, hips, and largre breasts. With men it means having broad shoulders, a nice ass, and solid arms. Synonyms include thoroughbred and brick house. Origin comes from the south where most of the meals were eaten with cornbread, and as a result, the people there were generally healthily built from the good eating.
