1N4N3
1N4N3 (pronoucned in-ayne) is a spoof off of the official word [inane]. It is commonly used to mean 'utterly retarted' and to completely bash your friends. When using the word be sure to say it with a demeaning and mocking tone. ; The fact that it is spelled 1N4N3 instead of Inane gives it a sense of 'eliteness' and makes it an honor to use.
