offwhoring
Offwhoring is the practice of hiring an external organization to perform some or all business functions in a country other than the one where the product was originally sold, consumed, and produced. This practice is so named because it is done at the cost of reducing domestic employment. It can be contrasted with offshoring, in which the functions are performed by a foreign division or subsidiary of the parent company. Opponents point out that this sends work overseas, thereby reducing domestic employment. Many jobs in the infotech sectors - such as data entry, and customer support - have been or are potentially affected.
