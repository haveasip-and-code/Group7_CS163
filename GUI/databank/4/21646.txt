bandh
A type of protest mobilisation commonly used in India. A bandh is a combination of a strike and a shutdown/blockade. Participants refrain from economic activity and usually set up roadblocks to 'enforce' the bandh and as a kind of rally. ; Bandhs may be called by any kind of organisation, not only trade unions or work-related groups - for instance, political parties, human rights groups, campaigning groups, women's groups, youth groups, etc, often call bandhs to protest various issues. They are usually regional rather than sectoral. Bandhs vary in duration from hour-long shutdowns to 'indefinite' bandhs which can go on for months.
