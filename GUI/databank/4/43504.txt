pirate radio
An unlicensed radio station, often broadcasting political or controvercial material. The term was coined in the 1960's with 'Radio Caroline', which broadcasted from a ship just outside of British territorial waters. Today's pirate broadcasters often play dance music not normally heard on comercial stations, or are intended to provide entertainment or opinions outside the mainstream.
