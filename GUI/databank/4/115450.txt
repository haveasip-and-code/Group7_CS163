Closet Britneyfan
One who bashes [Britney Spears] in public, in front of friends, on the internet (like urbandictionary.com- seriously, is it necessary to throw around words like 'slut' and type with horrible grammer about her? Just makin' yourselves look bad, that's all I'm saying...), etc. but secretly like her music and/or follow her every exploit like a Tigerbeat teen girl. ; I'd wager about 80% of Britney bashers secretly like her, and I know MANY of them. For as many people claim to hate her, suddenly it's weird when you look in their room and they have a few of her CDs (who later SWEAR it's their little sister's...sure). Also funny how she keeps hitting #1 all over the world when people continually say she's a fad and hate her...obviously there's quite a few who don't!
