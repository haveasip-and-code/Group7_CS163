Good Friends
A good friend is someone who is willing to forgive all that was said in the past, but remember all the good memories and move forward. I good friend is there to listen to you and backs you up 24/7. A good friend makes you feel better, and is there to laugh and cry with you when your in need. A good friend loves you, and would not hurt you, and if they did, would apologize, and become as good as friends again as before. That is a good friend.
