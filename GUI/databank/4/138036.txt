silver douche bag
A person that is thinks highly of themselves and looks down at the poor. George Carlin called Barbra Bush this after she said 'Almost everyone I've talked to says we're going to move to Houston...What I'm hearing which is sort of scary is they all want to stay in Texas. Everyone is ; so overwhelmed by the hospitality. And so many of the people in the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this--this (she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.' She may as well said let them eat cake. I never understood why the French cut off Marie Antoinette's head until Barbara Bush said this!!!
