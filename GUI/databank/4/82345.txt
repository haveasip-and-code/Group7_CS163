Lib
A [liberal]; Libs, plural form, fully said as [liberals]. This is an immoral person who claims to be a so-called 'Progressive', when they are actually incredibly bigotted themselves. In fact, a great majority of them don't understand, and usually don't care about those who have mental disabilites, or those with emotional disorders (though some of them do). This is just one way in which a Lib is a hypocrite.
