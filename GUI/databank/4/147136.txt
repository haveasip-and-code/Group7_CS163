The Israeli Army
The Israeli Army consists of unbelieveable people that will sacrifice their life for the good of the rest of the isralies. Yes, you are by law forced to join the army at the age of 18, but as an Israele, I know I speak for all other Israelies, becoming a soldier is an honour. Like your grandparents, and parents before you did. It's something you are born into. Seeing soldiers walking down the street. Like 18 year old kids in America, for them they know it's the normal, logical thing to go into College. For Isralies, the only thing that makes sense is going into the Army. For guys more than girls, it is important to get into the best units. It's a sign of bravery and who's more of a 'man'. The Israeli army (IDF) shapes the Israelis identity. It makes them who they are. It toughens them, and it connects them to their country. It is the best thing a person can go through. And I am greatful to be apart of such a unified country.
