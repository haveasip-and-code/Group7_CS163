Reply Hell
The blazing inferno that one might inadvertantly plunge into by having a prolonged letter or e-mail based correspondence with another -- and then repeatedly failing to execute satisfactorily complete replies ('I'll type up a more thorough response later'), resulting in a nearly indomitable accretion of material to address in future correspondences. Getting out of Reply Hell can be a task of Herculanean proportions, but, like the slaying of the Nemean Lion (or the viewing of the 'Dungeons & Dragons' movie from 2000), it is not ENTIRELY impossible.
