Nike Chiapas
Nike's representative in Chiapas, his job is to shoot all the locals and steal their land. That's why he doesn't like people who stand up for the oppressed. But he pretends to be an anarchist and joins anarchist lists so he can troll and flame people. ; Like [David Grenier], he enjoys torturing petty delinquents, schoolkids and homeless people so much that he comes out in a blue hissy fit every time someone suggests such people need liberating.
