Montreal Canadiens
The most storied hockey team and quite possibly sports team in history. Almost every great NHL player has played for the Montreal Canadiens. With 24 Stanley Cups, the most successfull NHL team ever. The greatest hockey team to ever exist, far better than those sucky ass Maple Leafs
