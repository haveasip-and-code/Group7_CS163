Jemper
This is a word created in the month of April and the date of 25 and the month of 2005 during the half time interval of Arsenal Vs Spurs. It comes from the word Jimpar which means to Jump while kicking somebodies head in. ; So to sum up it's half time and i'm bored. Jemper is a made up word that comes from the english Jimper which means to jump while kicking somebodies head in. ; Thank you
