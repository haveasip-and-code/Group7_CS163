stay at home mom
A woman who is capable of taking on children, home and husband. ; She is a strong woman who can handle anything that comes her way. ; Going to work outside of the house, then coming home to children and chores is hard (I've done it), but honey, let me tell you, staying home with children 24/7, never being able to socialize with other adults without any children around is MUCH more exuasting. ; Working outside of the house does Not equal to 3 full-time jobs, it equals to 1 full-time and 1 part-time. By the time you get home to the 'part-time job', you welcome the screaming of your little ones and singing sesame street songs, because you havn't heard it ALL DAY LONG!! ; Most stay at home moms aren't rich. Sometimes it's cheaper to stay home than to pay for daycare. ; Most (including myself) prefer to know that what the children are learning is coming from you, not daycare workers, or the 'rude kid' at daycare. ; These are crucial years, and they are lerning everything from scratch...best to be learning from mom.
