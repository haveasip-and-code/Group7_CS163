fake Prada bag
When you go to New York City and some dirty ass street peddler offers you a 'great deal' on a fake Prada bag for only 25 dollars, you turn it down, because youre not sure. So when they offer you two for 15 you kindly accept, eager to tell your friends what a great deal you just made. Then, 5 minutes later you get mugged by a pointman who saw you open your rich tourist wallet on the street, you stupid fuck. Then you drive 3 hours home and all you have is a fucking fake Prada bag that you compare to your friends fake Louis Vitton bag.
