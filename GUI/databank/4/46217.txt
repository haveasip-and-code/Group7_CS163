gonzaga
Gonzaga is a Roman Catholic School founded by the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits, in 1821. Gonzaga is the oldest educational institution in the old Federal City of Washington, and to this day continues to help young people grow towards religious, intellectual, and social maturity. ; Gonzaga is a school that emphasizes social teachings such as Men for Others. Men for Others means doing anything whether it be a service project or just volenteering a lunch period to go help out at the McKenna Center (an on campus homeless shelter kinda place). Also, besides all the other stuff in general its just a fun place to go to school the teachers are great ( bro. jon, doc. warman, mr. davis, l'etoile, etc.) and the guys there are cool. Its really laid back and fun. I personally like it because of the since of independence it gives you. Also its not gay and uptight such as the country club in maryland called [georgetown prep]. For the other person who was bashing gonzaga in the previous post definetly has never been and expierenced what the whole gonzaga school is like.
