ness
1. A character in the SNES game Earthbound. Later appeared in N64's Super Smash Bros, and Super Smash Bros. Melee, the sequel to the popular Gamecube game. ; 2. A good way to not be as funny, original, or clever as you might think. Many people will add '-ness' as a suffix to just about everything, to turn it into a noun. The most annoying of all uses is 'coolness.' While a select few may find this funny, almost everyone else agrees that it sucks.
