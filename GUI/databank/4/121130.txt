Weird Al
Full Name: Weird Al Yankovich. ; Funny guy who writes great lyrics usually as parodies of infectious hit songs. A common misconception is that Weird Al writes lyrics to make fun of other artists, but that simply is not true. He always gets permission from the artists before he publishes his parodies. The one time an artist complained about a parody that Weird Al wrote, it turned out to be communication error. Sometimes artists will even approach him to do parodies of their songs. ; Some musicians have noted that in order for one to know if they have really 'made it' in the music business is to have one of your songs parodied by Al! ; Although his lyrics are funny, often VERY funny, Weird Al doesn't have the best voice, nor is he the best entertainer. In fact many find that his vocals and accordian accompaniments are very annoying.
