B-wing
A cool starfighter in Star Wars. Unfortunately, it only appears in a few short scenes in Return of the Jedi, but thankfully the novels and comics afterwards exploited the awesomeness of this ship. The B-Wing is a Rebel fighter designed by the [Mon Calamari], which kind of explains why it looks so weird. Anyways, it was meant to replace the Y-Wing in the Rebel fleet, and it carried a large amount of weaponry, such as 3 laser cannons and two ion cannons. The cockpit was on a swivel, which allowed the rest of the craft to rotate around it. I don't know how helpful that would be, but it looks pretty cool.
