sarasota
the place where driving is like moving around cones, because of the snowbirds whose buicks are the size of Tulsa. The place where ridiculously pale midwestern tourists come down to visit their redneck counterparts and show off their new tribal tattoos and trendy abercrombie board shorts while they get hammered at the daquiri deck. the place that feigns diversity and sophistication because it is still segregated (admit it), but most of all it is the sweetest town on the gulf coast, with some of the most beautiful babies (all local) and the best weather one could ever ask for. SRQ, represent.
