Mac 10
The Mac-10 is a submachine gun developed in the mid-1960s by Gordon B. Ingram for use by urban operators. It fires either the .45 ACP or the 9mm x 19 Parabellum cartridge. This gun is reknowm for it's incredible cyclic rate of fire- 1145 rpm. The gun fires from an open bolt (causing minimal accuracy) and it is mainly made of pressed steel. MAC strands for Marietta Armament Corperation, the company that made most of these guns. Another version, the [Mac 11], fires the shorter .380 ACP round. Both guns were made to fit a Sionics Company suppressor/silencer. ; I cannot stress enough that a MAC 10 is NOT an Uzi. They are two completely different weapons. Get it through your heads.
