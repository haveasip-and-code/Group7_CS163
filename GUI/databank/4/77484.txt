se-port
The place that Ward Melville made. Even that little plaque behind the register says it. The deli with the overpriced sanwiches and overdressed (sometimes underdressed) girls and guys. Occassionally a beard will be sported, most always a lax stick. Boone, Gasm, Deathwish, some just wish for their death because they can\'t handle it all in one sitting. Park your car to the side feed the ducks and enjoy the French Fries. Se-Port Deli, it wouldn\'t be Three Village or 25A without it. Right next to Fox\'s.
