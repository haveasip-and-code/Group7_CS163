south williamsport
'Dunn diddy diddy dunn dunn... Where everybody knows your name....', because not one person in [South Williamsport] minds their own business at anytime of the day. Probably the noseiest town in America. [South Williamsport]... Where people live their lives off of everyone else... except for the gangsters across the bridge.
