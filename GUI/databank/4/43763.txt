don't touch that  it's franks
melissa(the one with herpes) will never offer you a pillow to sleep on at night, a blanket when you're freezing, a coughdrop when you're coughing your lungs out, a can of coke, a paper cup of sink water, a plate to eat, a napkin to wipe your face, her toilet, lipgloss, a rubberband, shoes if you're barefoot and there's broken glass eveywhere, and she won't let you even sit on the couch or turn on the tv. why? because everything belongs to frank.
