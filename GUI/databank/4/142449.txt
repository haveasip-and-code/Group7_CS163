that's my bop
a sign of dominance over another. When that person has been shamed or something of the like, 'thats my bop' is said by the dominant figure then he/she snaps his/her fingers in the air and taps the subordinate figure on the shoulder. Widely used in Xavier High School, located in Manhattan, and its origins are unknown. Some speculate the mysterious band of hispanics are the originators of this odd phrase.
