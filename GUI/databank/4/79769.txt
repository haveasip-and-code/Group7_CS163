Media
Ancient country, the inhabitants of which, the Medians, ruled over an empire stretching from Asia Minor (modern day Turkey) to the Indus Valley in India. The Medians closest relatives today are the Kurds. ; Unfortunately, as with most Kurdish history which supports the fact that the Kurds have lived in their current homeland for thousands of years, a lot of evidence has been hidden/destroyed when the Kurds, like so many forgotten peoples, were trying to be assimilated and wiped out, forgotten. But they're not! ; And we still know our history bastards!!! Can't hide the truth...
