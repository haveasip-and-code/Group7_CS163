Phrasebook Romeo
A term to describe [Asiaphiles] who make some half-assed attempt at learning a language so they can harass foreigners (typically [Asians]) with their poorly pronounced drivel in the hope of appearing cute or organizing some kind of 'language exchange'. Of course we all know that the intended outcome is [sex]. ; Such behavior is typically displayed by [Wapanese] [losers] for whom Western women aren't good enough. ; The term originates from the practice of looking up pickup lines in a foreign language phrasebook but failing miserably in the delivery.
