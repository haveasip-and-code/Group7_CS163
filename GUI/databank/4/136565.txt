Cyber Dyke
1)an interesting insult used by interesting people... ; 2) A lesbian who's masculine and constantly on the computer. And instead of pimping the real life chicks they have to settle for the other computer nerds who A) Live in a homophobic area, like Alabama, B) They're still in the closet but can't resist female ACTION. or C) They're a lost cause and no one is willing to date them in fear of getting an STD or simply because of how they look. Oh, and cyber dykes aren't fond of boys, so gentilemen, keep your distance unless you want to loose something very.. Close to you.
