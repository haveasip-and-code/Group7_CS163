Mike Dirnt
The bassist of Green Day. Possibly the best punk rock bassist to ever step foot on this retched land that we call Earth. He made his own special bass(its awesome) and he is nice and kinda funny but sometimes he laughs at his own jokes and its embarrasing,but HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE HIM??? He is KICK ASS!!!! Oh yeah..he's kinda hot too.....
