New Deal
Brainless scheme concocted by the Blair Government to massage unemployment statistics, or to pour scorn on 18-24 year olds (I'm still undecided). ; The whole concept of getting you into work is to send you on training courses (the first for two weeks, the second for SIX MONTHS), where you're supposed to participate in sessions on how to get a job, rather than...trying to get a job. And, even if you do manage to sneak in an application, you have to have your phone switched off - so how can a potential employer contact you?!? ; Of course, when you're on one of these courses, you're a 'student', not 'dole scum', so therefore you help Tony Blair lie to the population yet again. All this for your paltry Job Seeker's Allowance, which they try and cut off (or at least threaten to) without a moment's notice to keep you in line, yet your Advisor never actually pays attention to what jobs you want, or the fact you're overqualified for a GCSE drop-out position.
