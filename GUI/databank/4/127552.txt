Bon Jovi
Possibly the best rock band to ever put out an entire album of power ballads (Slippery When Wet). Led by singer Jon Bon Jovi, the band is one of the few to make the transition from the 80's hair metal scene to the alternative nineties. Liked mostly by girls, and currently not cool in the public's eye, but we all know that they rocked pretty hard.
