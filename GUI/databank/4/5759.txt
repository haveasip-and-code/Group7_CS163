backdraft
When smoking marijuana, a person can take a hit too deep, which burns the back of their throat. They then hold their chin against their chest, thus holding the burning sensation down. Eventually this sensation seems to 'burn itself out,' like a real fire deprived of oxygen. However, also similar to real fire, when you raise your head and open a passage for air, the burning 'flares up,' like real backdraft.
