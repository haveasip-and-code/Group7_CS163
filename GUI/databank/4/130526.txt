Blue eyed soul
Moniker used to describe white people who try their best to sound Black when they sing or in their style of music. ; Very few, however have ever succeeded in pulling this off(the exception being artists like Teena Marie, Hall and Oates). Most end up sounding like they're singing falsetto and sounding over enunciated (Joss Stone, Rick Astley, etc).
