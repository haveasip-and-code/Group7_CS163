Kindred
'Kindred' means 'akin to', in the sense of being related or similar to something. A 'kindred spirit' defines someone with similar values and desires to one's own. ; In popular usage, the word is associated with the White Wolf roleplaying game 'Vampire: The Masquerade' (later 'Vampire: Requiem'). In this context, the word (usually capitalised) is used to refer to a single vampire, a group of vampires, or vampire society as a whole. ; (It should be noted that this usage is a little awkward when used to refer to a single individual. Since the word 'kindred' defines similarity it therefore implies plurality.)
