death from above 1979
Insanely talented duo that make amazing music. Made up of Sebastian Grainger (Vocals/Drums) and Jesse F. Keeler (Bass). The most awesome thing about this band is that the band sounds better with only 2 people then any other band with more people. Jesse is a fucking awesome bass player. I saw them in concert, man was it fucking insane. I shit my pants. They also played Mother by Danzig. Simply awesome.
