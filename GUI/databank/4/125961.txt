puerto rico
A small island state in the Caribean, just southeast of the United States. This island is a tumultous and dirty breeding ground for filthy, lazy people. Peurto Ricans are proud, hence their silly flags and CD's hanging from the mirrors of their fart-piped, rice-burners. They are overrunning the SouthEast and Northeast United states, and breeding like roaches. They refuse to assimilate into American culture and are causing a large problem, especially in Florida.
