Pingry
There are two Pingry Schools: one in Short Hills, NJ, the other in Martinsville, NJ. ; While Pingry may seem a harmless & friendly learning environment, it's actually evil. You fit in or you don't. The workload is like child labor. Money is poured into useless stuff, like a Middle School. Keep the midgets in the basement, for chrissake. ; But Pingry has its upsides. There are shiny, odd-shaped things on the ceilings. If you avoid the meat and fish, the food is quite good. You may even find somebody who hasn't been zombified by pop culture! Fancy that.
