McGlyvin
A word that is used to describe a very nerdy/geeky person or action. It can also be said as an exclamatory remark to highlight and make fun of someone's geekiness. This word originates from the noise that Professor Frink (from The Simpson's) frequently makes when he is excited about some scholarly invention or notion.
