derheim
dir-hime ; v. derheimed, derheiming, derheimes ; 1. A term used when one runs away during a soccer practice and then claims they were in the woods playing with mud. In reality, the culprit had just shit their pants with unimaginable force, thus creating the synonym 'dirty butt'. Not a common disability but one often confused with diarrhea. One that suffers from derheiming uncontrollably tends to also blast penile fluid all over young unsuspecting women's faces.
