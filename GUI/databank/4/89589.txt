A woman who's a co-host of X Play and has a new feature in FHM magazine. She appeals to the horny male; age 18-34 demographic that G4 is trying to net because of her T&A, which isn't even all that. She knows nothing about video games, and is just another annoying personality. ; Most gamers drool over her because she's a girl who plays video games. Guess what kids? There's no chance you're going to get her. And if you're tuning into X Play just to see her.. Then you're looking at it for the wrong reasons. ; You should've stuck w/ doing Windows tips on The Screen Savers Morgan. You're no gamer.
