hemel hempstead
Possibly the greatest town in existence. Full of intelligent, friendly people and with far less chavs than most towns in the UK. Home of the beautiful architectural masterpiece known as the Kodak Tower, the tallest building in the United Kingdom. Usually ripped on by outsiders because of their extreme jealousy (see above defintions).
