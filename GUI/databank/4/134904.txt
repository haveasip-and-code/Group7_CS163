sitemap
Also, [site map]. One of the most confusing words in the world of [web site] [design], because it means too many different things to too many different people, with more people compounding the [confusion] by making up new meanings for it. There is a [potential] to differentiate between meanings by spelling one meaning as one word, and another meaning as two words, but no such standard is broadly accepted. ; 1. In web site design, [HTML], [SEO], and [navigation], n., a [web page], usually relatively plain in design, that links to every page on the web site, displaying the [link]s within the structural hierarchy of the [site]. ; 2. In web page design and HTML, correctly known as [image map], but frequently called site map instead by [n00bs], n., a method of linking different portions of an [image] to different [URL]s. In some cheaply-designed web sites, an entire web page may be designed into a single image map, so that the entire content of the page, including the text, is presented as an image, rather than as a combination of text and images. ; 3. In project pre-production, n., an optional design process preliminary to [flowchart]ing, used mostly for multi-page projects, such as web sites. ; 4. To [Google], a [text] or [XML] [file] added to the [root directory] of your web site to let Google's [spider] know the names and dates of your web site's [searchable] files. To differentiate from previous meanings of the word, this [upstart] definition should be known as, [Google sitemap]. However, other [search engines] may be following suit.
