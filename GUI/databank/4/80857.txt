Pikachu
Just like other japanese pokemon names, the word Pikachu has a childish meaning from onomatopeic expressions such as girigiri and pikapika. Pika is taken from the sound of sparks or the effect of something being shiny. Chu is the sound a mouse makes as well as a kiss. Easy for children to remember and understand. Pikachu is an electric mouse pokemon, although he looks like a rabbit squirrel tiger with cockatiel cheeks. He popularized pokemon and is the main mascot of the show in the united states. Much more popular now that in japan as now japan has been taken over by battle beatles. Some people want him to die and some want to make love to him. I thought he was cute when I was 12.
