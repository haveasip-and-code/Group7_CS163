smithtown
A pretty boring town about an hour east of New York City on [Long Island]. Typical Friday nights include going bowling, going to the movies, doing drugs, or just ending up at the [Millenium Diner]. Kids here have nothing to do but write [gun threats] on desks in math classrooms and get suspended for cutting studyhall to do drugs. Everyone here is either a [JAP], a pseudo-ghetto kid, or a bitchy girl who shops at [Abercrombie]. Most pretend to go to 'shows' when really all they do is stay at home and complain about the fact that no good shows come to Smithtown.
