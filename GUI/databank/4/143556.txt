Tegan and Sara
A band whos members (Tegan and Sara) are from Calgary, Alberta (best city ever) they sing folk/rock alternative sort of music and its pretty good. You have to get use to their voices though which are sometimes high pitch and whiney but other than that they rock. ; They have 4 Albums out: Under Feet Like Ours, This Business of Art, If It Was You, So Jealous (there newest and best CD so far)
