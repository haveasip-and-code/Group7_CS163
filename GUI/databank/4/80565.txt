clog
A pedestrian who monopolizes shared walkways with complete inconsideration of others. Most often used to describe the following: a lackadaisical walker who blocks other, more agile, pedestrians from getting to where they need to go; one of a larger group of lunchtime strollers who think it's cute to walk shoulder-to-shoulder, five or six in a row, on a busy city sidewalk.
