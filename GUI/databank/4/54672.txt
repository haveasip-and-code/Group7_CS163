Megaphlogatr
'Mega Flowing Gator'. ; Referring to an decidedly oversized alligator, flowing down stream in a river. Or perhaps the alligator's physical form has converted into liquid, therefore being able to flow around freely, without requiring a passage of water for the act of flowing, as the liquified form of the aforementioned reptillian animal would itself become the passage in which it flows.
