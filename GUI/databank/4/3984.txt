maret
Maret: a school focusing on acedemics, full of incredibly well-rounded, intellectual and talented students who will succeed in life. This is unlike schools like Landon where students cheat on tests. It is also not all boys like STA or not all girls like (NCS) which helps make the kids more ready for society. Even though our mascot isnt great it eats grasshoppers and isnt as weird as quakers. We also take pride in not smoking as much weed as GDS or Field. We are also not a perverted school like Landon.
