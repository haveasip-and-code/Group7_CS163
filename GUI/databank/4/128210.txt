breaditarian
A person who decides to become a vegetarian but does not really eat any vegetables. They will often eat bread products, plain pizza, cereal, or various types of junk food because they contain no meat. However, this can be unhealthy because they aren't getting balance in their diet. It will also not help them if they are trying to lose weight.
