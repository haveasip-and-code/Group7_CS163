Hot coffee
Hillary Clinton's excuse to make an expose' of what she thinks is a 'dangerous and potentially harmful market'. Hot Coffee has come to symbolize politicians vs. the first amendment- To make matters worse- Aforementioned politicians truly have no interest in this subject- and only use it to gain political prowess. ; Basically Hillary is only making a big deal about this because she thinks she has a penis, and wants to be president in 08. Crazy bitch.
