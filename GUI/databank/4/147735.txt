Quakertown
You know you are from Quakertown and its surrounding areas if; The best thing to do is go to Wal Mart on a Friday or Saturday night. You know exactly what Grida's is and know its opening day and closing day. The back parking lot of the Regal is the best for doing donuts in. The car shows at Dairy Queen are always a big hit! You know that Haycock is an elementary school, and not some lame sexual innuendo You know exactly who Mario Galante is. The Milford soccer games were put on delay because of a cow being in the middle of the field. Dominick's/ Giovanni's/ Pizza Randa all have the best pizza in town (Thank you Gewles). You have a really large feeling of disgust when you hear someone say they are from Pennridge. One word QMART! You know your screwed when there is traffic, not because of cars, but because of the slow ass tractor in front of you. Knowing that half the town worked/works at Friendly's or Giant.
