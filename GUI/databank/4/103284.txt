Great Expectations
A novel written by [Charles Dickens] in weekly parts from December 1860 to August 1861. Great Expectations is the story about Pip, a selfish, whiny teenager that grows up into a 'gentleman.' This is a novel assigned to many high school students to read, and probably the most boring book in existence. My advice, don't waste your time, cliffs notes work.
