timmah
Timmah (Pronounced, TIM-AY!) Apprently the word the timmy character in South Park likes to shout OFTEN! Often confused with 'timmy' which is less dramatic and only stupid people who do not know how to pronouce timmah use. Used either as a sign of excitement, or if some1 asks you a question and u don't feel like answering and wanna make the asker crack up at you.
