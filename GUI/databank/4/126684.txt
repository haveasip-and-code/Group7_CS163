The Neverending Story
A 1984 movie about a kid named Bastian that, after being chased by bullies, runs into a book store and steals a book entitled 'The Neverending Story'. He becomes immersed in the book, and starts thinking and feeling the same things as the book's main character, Atreyu. In the book, a terrible swarm of 'nothingness' is taking over -- destroying the world and leaving a big empty space. Atreyu is sent to find a cure for this 'nothing' to save the Childlike Empress. In the end, however, it is only Bastian that can save the world inside The Neverending Story.
