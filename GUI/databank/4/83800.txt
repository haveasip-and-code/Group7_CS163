Poker - 15
A short haired (ginger) boy, who seems to think he owns the place... strolling round the place with his collar popped. His favourite phrase: 'Oh my lord'. he is famous for his crush on a little miss rynog (location - somewhere in the jungle). another point of major embarresment is when he was chosen last a chelsea football course. Happy days!
