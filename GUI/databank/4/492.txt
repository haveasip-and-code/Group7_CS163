Safeway
A grocery story with employees that call you by whatever typo your Safeway card has on it, or what your phone number says. This is an attempt to be personal, but it's rather creepy. ; Otherwise, a decent store that annoyingly liberal people boycott for no reason, claming that [Trader Joe's] has better deals when it's actually a lot more expensive.
