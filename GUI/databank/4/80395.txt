Lester Bangs
Lester was born in 1948 and passed away in 1982. Lester Bangs was a well known, highly respected rock critic. He was also an author, part-time rock singer and generally a very talented writer. The way I see it, its fair to say he was the Jack Kerouac of rock literature. As a journalist, he had a reputation for being honest and passionate.
