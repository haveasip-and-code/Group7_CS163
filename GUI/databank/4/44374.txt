Rydal
Not to confused with Meadowbrook or Jenkintown despite the identical zip code, Rydal, is a small town made up with Jews who have nice cars, go to the private school located near by, not Abington High School, who wear too much juicy couture, designer threads, have fake noses, can get lots of drugs, and whatever else they wish in their desperate boring lives to come.
