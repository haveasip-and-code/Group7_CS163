McDojo
A martial arts school that is run for the purposes of making money without teaching true martial arts. The most common signs of a McDojo include a lack of sparring classes, no opportunities to compete in a tournament, outrageous fees, and a promise on having a black belt in 2-3 years. Earning the black belt in 2-3 years, depending on skill, is quite alright in many systems, as there are always highly talented pupils. However, the promise from first glance is a sure-sign. ; Not all Taekwondo schools are McDojos, despite popular belief. Pre-School programs, American/Korean flags, mirrors, and the lack of an Asian instructor do not equal a McDojo. I study at a school that has all of these, and nobody would even dream of accusing my school of being a McDojo. The ignorant martial artists that like to blam Taekwondo because it is a newer style and because it's popular have no clue. There are Kung Fu schools that fingers should be pointed at. There's a perfect example in DengFeng, the Chinese Martial Arts City. The monks will sign any foreigner off as a master just so they can get a good laugh. Taekwondo is not a bullshido style. We taekwondo types are just scapegoats for the ignorant martial artists of other styles.
