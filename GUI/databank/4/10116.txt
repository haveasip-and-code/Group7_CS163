Pig Circus
Originally a slur against police and used by Bob Dylan in his song Hurricane, the term has come to mean a farce or phony court trial, where generalizations are made about facts that don't exist in order to meet a predetermined outcome desired by the judge, judiciary, government, or Bar Association.
