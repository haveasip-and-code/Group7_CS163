new hampshire
One of the most interesting states in the nation, where just about everything is legal and everyone who isn't white gets pulled over and beaten the moment they cross the border. The weather sucks, but it looks nice in the summer time and not having sales tax is nice as well. Unfortunately, the smart people don't live in New Hampshire, but in the surrounding states near the borders and drive into New Hampshire to shop and return home to live in more affordable areas. It's got some pretty sick roads, which are unfortunately polluted by residents not knowing how to drive their Subarus, see also [maine]. Overall, one of those states that looks nice in a book or magazine, but you'd never want to visit.
