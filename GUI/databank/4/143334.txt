drum corps
Many of the top marching musicians of a region participating in an event similar to marching band, but different in the fact that it uses only brass and percussion instruments. Woodwinds (clarinets, flutes, saxophones, etc) are excluded from drum corps. Despite what many [bandos] will say, Drum Corps is not 'marching band on steroids,' but a totally beast than both college or high school marching bands. It requires immense amounts of both time and energy to march in a drum corps, and is a truly amazing experience for all Corps Members.
