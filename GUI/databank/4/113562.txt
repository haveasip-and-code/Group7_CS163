melt faces
Began on the World of Warcraft Priest class forum when a player posted a thread asking if Shadow Priests were any good on PVP servers. The first response was 'You will melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.' Hundreds of posts followed that were some variant of this original post. ; The ability to 'melt faces' is now being used to not only describe shadow priests in World of Warcraft, but anything that 'owns' or is 'elite.'
