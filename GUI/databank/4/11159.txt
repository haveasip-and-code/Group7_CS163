zakk wylde
The most amazing guitarist of the day. Many people assume things about Zakk wylde, but they just realize that theyre punk ass garbage bands or themselves cannot live up to Zakk's blistering solos. Do you see any other bands pull this shit off? Not many. Dimebag Darrell was also good friends with him(R.I.P) Also, people say hes a wannabe biker. He isnt a wannabe, and I guarantee you wouldnt say that to his face. Quit hiding behind the fucking screen, and do something if you feel that way. Also as said before, extremely loyal to friends, and also a very caring person. Get on his bad side though, and he'll kick your ass. Enough said.
