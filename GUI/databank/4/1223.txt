subaru
After a 2 year obsession with subaru i have found out a ton about them. First off its a jap. company witch produces the only All symmetrical All Wheel Drive system that subaru is famous for. Subaru is really famous for its rally preformance. The rally subaru impreza wrx sti contains a horizontally opposed 4 cylinder engine that produces an amazing 300 horsepower with an AWD system as well. Think about it a ferrari spider produces 360 horsepower on a 8 cylinder engine. With even 25 less torque then the subaru. Subaru accelerates faster then most sport cars including the prosche 911 turbo. Also it has been known for insurance costs to be less when a person owns a subaru due to the safety a AWD system gives you. Its famous boxer engine contains the cylinders opposite each other instead of one after the other like in all other cars. Subaru is the best company in the world and the Subaru WRX STI is the best car in the world. You would give me a free mclauren f1 i would sell it and buy a subaru wrx or maybe even a outback witch has more ground clearence then a BMW X5 ; if you would like to contact me AIM = Subaruwrxh4
