dare to suck
That doesn't mean try to suck. It means to try and possibly fail -- to take risks. To dare -- and maybe fall flat on your face, with a community of friends to say 'Hey, that sucked! But nice try!' From the Theater of Ted, www.daretosuck.com. All credit for this goes to the respective persons who created this, not me.
