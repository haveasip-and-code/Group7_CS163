laconia
A region of far southern Greece. Here at Taenarum was supposedly an entrance to Hades. When Theseus was convinced by his friend Peirithous to attempt the ill-fated abduction of Persephone, the Queen of the Dead, the two are said to have journeyed to the Underworld by means of a cave in Laconian Taenarum.
