sin trim
'Sin Trim' is when you strip me and hold me down and shave me and then make a festive wreath out of the trimmings often augmenting my natural bounty with figs and olives. Traditionally fermented wild boar blood broth is filtered through the trim into the open mouths of the brotherhood consecrating our bond to Mog the Destroyer.
