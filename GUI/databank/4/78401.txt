Deregulation
If you hear this word mentioned in a positive light, odds are someone rich is talking. ; Deregulation of various industries is a concept loudly heralded by Republicans and Conservatives in general as a means to 'promote competition' and 'stimulate the economy'. These people can be trusted of course because, as we all know, their brilliant strategy of cutting taxes for the people most likely to send labor off American shores and setting the tax burden on the lower and middle classes is working like a charm. ; Anyone with half a brain can quickly figure out that they're more or less looking for a friendlier way of saying they'd like to make it easier to act outside the law, let unsafe and under-tested products roll off assembly lines on the cheap, and bring back the days before the Clayton Antitrust Act; a glorious time period in which the grand-daddies of the current crop of Republicans made their money and earned their clout.
