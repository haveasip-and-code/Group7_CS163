It dosen't do shit but maybe relieve some pain or make you hungry so you don't starve to death. ; These people also complain that their addiction is no worse than greed or ignorance, etc. Yet these morons are ignornat about what these drugs conatin or do to their brains over long periods of time and the fact that drug dealers are all about selling a [dime bag] for some cash.
