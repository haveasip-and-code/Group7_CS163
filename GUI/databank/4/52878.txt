F.A.G
FAG is the name given the Film Actors' Guild of peaceniks in 'Team America.' ; Alec Baldwin is the head of F.A.G., [Film Actors'Guild, not Ben Affleck. Affleck's little buddy from that Mork from Ork movie, Matt Damon, is in 'Team America,' delivering his one line, 'Matt Damon,' a la Timmy.] Kim Jong Il invites F.A.G to a world peace summit.
