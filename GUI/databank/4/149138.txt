parping
as in 'farting about': A series a needless/inane tasks which are undertaken by the 'parper' prior to going to the pub/cinema/airport etc... such as reorganising the location of house keys, tobacco, lighter in ones bag/pockets for no real reason, checking each room in the house for no reason, indesision of which scarf/hat to wear, whether to take a hat/scarf or not, and which bag to put them in, if taken. Which ultimately results in missing the 1st 15 minutes of the film, missing the flight etc... (it's a chick thing!)
