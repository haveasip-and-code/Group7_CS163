Boys Latin
Fact: Boys' Latin is the world's greatest lax institute in America. We have produced more Division I athletes for lacrosse than any other program. We had 4 captains in the 2004 final fours. ON DIFFERENT TEAMS. We are a family that belongs to a 220 man country club. Dress code is: mullets, raggedy old plaid jackets, pink pants, and white loafers. And that's the only acceptable way to dress. It's a place where we drink a beer with the old lax coach or hit it with him on the links. It's a place where we throw sweedish fish in Billy's fish tank and watch him freak out. WE like to bother the uptight teachers but we keep it real with the DUKE! BL is a home away from home. Some even call it home. WE have teachers who are pushing 100, Mr. Bowling Whoaa, Get OOOUT!. BL is a place where we grow up and get neighboring houses with your best buds. A place where your family becomes a legacy over the generations. BL is a place that will give you memories to last a life time.
