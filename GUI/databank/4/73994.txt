Allen Collins
Born in 1952, in Jacksonville Florida. In his High School years, he joined a band, but then later transfered to the all-time best band, Lynyrd Skynyrd. He had many solos, and wrote 'Free Bird' with Ronnie Van Zant. He's one of the best guitar players in history, if not the best. He survived the plane crash in October of 77, but later got in a horrible car accident which left him paralyzed, and died in 90 of complications from the accident. He'll forever be one of the best guitar players ever.
