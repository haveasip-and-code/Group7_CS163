cori duff
a male, with incredibly beady eyes, obviously to make up for his lack of personality or facial expression, incapable of real laughter, boring boring boring, often says 'what have you got next'. often feigns injury for attention, much like alistair goosey. can be seen running to his guidance teacher when he feels life is too much.
