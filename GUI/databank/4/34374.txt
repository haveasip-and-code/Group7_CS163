Korn
A band from blakersfeild californian. they stared in about 1993 and their first album simply titled Korn was released in 1994. Four years later korn reached mainstream fame with the release of 'follow the leader' which debuded #1 and has sold 5 million copies in the U.S. alone. after that korn slowly lost popularity but they still have some die hard fans. As for korn's music's it FUCKING KICKS ASS! No on had heard anything like it before. the low sounds and jagged vocals are beyond comparisson. Korn has also brought along other bands like Limp Bizkit and Orgy. But of course you probly hate korn and the entire nu metal gerne. so let me say this. if you wanna hate somthing why Nu metal? it was only in the main stream for like a year. now its shrunk considerably. so whats the bigger threat to the music you like. a couple of nu metal groups or the main stream garbage that you see on MTV every fuckin day.
