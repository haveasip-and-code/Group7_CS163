P's and Q's
Shaortening for 'Pints and Quarts', which were the two main measurements for drinks. Whereas now we use pints, half pints, shots etc, there used to be Pints and Quarts. ; Whehn things got rowdy, as they tend to do in pubs, you'd normally hear something like 'Mind your Pints and Quarts' and a warning or some such. this was shortened to 'mind your P's and Q's'
