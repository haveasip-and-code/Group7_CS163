onegina
A feared and dreadful disease, also known as onewenis. ; Very often, a seemingly mild case of onegina can develop into a more chronic, and sometimes even lifetime condition. The only cure for that strain of onegina is death - yours or hers. Do you want to live with a debilitating illness??? God no! ; Better to be single and go around fucking all the randoms you secretly wish you were fucking, and not allow this sneaky opportunistic illness take hold and ruin your life. ; Unfortunately there is no way to vaccinate for onegina at the moment, although many of the world's greatest thinkers and visionaries are working on the problem as we speak - their greatest efforts so far concentrated on fizzy sweet alcohol drinks like Bacardi Breezers, otherwise known as 'Leg-Openers', and guaranteed to put an illicit sexual event with a questionable whore on your calendar. ; All I can say in warning, is be ever vigilant to the symptoms of onegina, which are enumerated as follows: ; 1. An amazingly huge amount of softcock thoughts and deeds ; 2. A constant look of contempt on your friends' faces when they talk to you ; 3. An appreciation for gay shit like 'going out for dinner' or 'taking in a movie' or at its worst, 'a quiet one at home with the missus' ; 4. A general unwillingness to be awesome ; By the time you get to the crucial endstages of onegina and manifest symptoms like 'Going shopping with the missus for shoes' its probably too late - and the only way out is as quick and painless a suicide as possible.
