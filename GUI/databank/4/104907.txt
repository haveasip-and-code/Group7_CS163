Flint Hill
A place of great wealth and treasure that Albert Einstein himself founded. Indiana Jones was the first man to set foot in this vast facility of knowledge and power. All too often the Nazi remnant located in France has tried to claim the power from this place, but the monkeys who guard the place tear the heads off of blonde haired, blue eyed people. Those heads are then used for sorting footage of old porn films dedicated to chewbacca.
