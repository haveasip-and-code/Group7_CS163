Yuppie Short Bus
A bright-yellow [Hummer 2] SUV. ; Derived from the schoolyard slang term [short bus]--the bus mentally retarded and disabled students ride in--and the fact that, like American school buses, it is bright-yellow and black. Unfortunately, in the case of the Yuppie Short Bus, the retarded person is usually in the driver's seat.
