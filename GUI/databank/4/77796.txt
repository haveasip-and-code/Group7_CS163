birkenjock
A subspecies of the typical frat-boy type: misogynistic, politically conservative, alcoholic, horny, Abercrombie and baseball cap wearing jock. 'Birkenjocks' differ from the typical frat-boy only in their recreational choices, smoking pot and listening to bands typically associated with a more liberal lifestyle, like Phish, Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, Bob Marley, and 311.
