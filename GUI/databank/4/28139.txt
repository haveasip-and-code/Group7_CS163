solar flares
Origin: teenage boys summer camp sports event. The sport of lighting farts in a darkened cabin. Longest, brightest wins overall. Best of class can include categories such as color (yellow for sulfur, blue for the rarer methane-producers.) Other categories such as least-singed butthairs are rarer and judged less often, primarily because someone has to be designated as counter of singed butthairs and that requires a strong magnifying glass and an even stronger stomach or a perverted interest in men's butts.
