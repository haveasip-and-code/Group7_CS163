aussie
An alcoholic drink derived from the University of Toledo. While exact measurements are not known, ingredients are as follows: ; Vodka ; Triplesec ; Lime Juice (Lemon juice may be used as a substitute) ; Fruit Punch (Generic Kroger brand is the best) ; Even if I did tell you the exact measurements, I'm sure you'd forget them after the 1st drink.
