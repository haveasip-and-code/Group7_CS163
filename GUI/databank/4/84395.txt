sour diesel
A genetic strain of Marijuana, bred (or popularised by) a great man named Soma. Its identifying traits are bright, light green buds, highly resinous and somewhat dense buds, absolutely drenched with trichomes (crystals), and the most pungent smell ever. Tastes like candy too. I just wish it wasn't so expensive. Cant wait for the next Uberstrain!
