OSH
The OS Hideout (or OSH) is a community where users talk about hip-hop, sports talk, and life in general. The OSH has built in board money where users can wager their earned money on sporting events and rise to the top of the casino standings. The original OSH started in January of 2005 and had over 150,000 posts before moving to a new home in October 2005. The member list of the OSH includes respected members of the IGN community along with members of many rap community boards. The diverse list makes for intelligent and interesting conversations and debates. Sports, music, technology, and compelling news stories are some of the more talked about topics on the board. ; [http://oshideout.worldgamerz.com/]OS Hideout
