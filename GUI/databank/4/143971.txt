North Haledon
Rich?We like to pretend we are.You say our houses are worth alot?Maybe.But we have no money to spend.Our taxs are insane for the Highschool that [Haledon] and [prospect park] go to for free.Our entertainment is speeding through our 3 mile town and hoping not to get caught by one of the 30 cops we have hired.That or watching the 10 DPW workers work on the baseball fields all day.Yes we are living it up. ; If you live in North Haledon your Probly Dutch.If you are Dutch and live in North Haledon,your not much.
