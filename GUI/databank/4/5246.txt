bong
A water pipe or bong is a device used for smoking, usually [Cannabis] (and less frequently tobacco or other substances), in which smoke is bubbled through a chamber containing water. The bong enables the operator to smoke in a manner very differently than is possible with a simple smoking pipe or [joint] ([spliff]). Most bongs are designed to either cool the smoke before it enters the operator's lungs, build up a large buffer of smoke which the user inhales quickly, or both. The word bong derives from the Thai word baung which refers to a cut off section of bamboo.
