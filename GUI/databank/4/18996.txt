Vipocracy
A state of government or rule where in all senses of morality and sociatal correctness are discarded and an anarchistic rule is established. First realised by two chatroom members known as the Vipers when they took power and set themselves up as the demigods of the known boards. One may also take a Vipocratic oath in which one shows his respect to the randomness of life and rule of the Vipers and is willing to adhere to the customs that are in place at that specific time.
