Kinz
Kinz, or 'Kinza' is the 2007-Graduate BASS BONE player in Jazz Band. He dwells on the internet on the [Griffler] forums (look up the name, biatch.) and he rather likes 'The God Father'. In 2004, Kinz had his big break as young aspiring recording artist, Vicki wrote and performed a song about him called 'Kinza the stoner'. The song recieved a grammy because of its greatness and Kinz's wealth only rose. Well uh, the end.
