Okie credit card
A short length of hose used to syphon gasoline from someone else's gas tank. You syphon the gas into a bucket, coffee can, or any other appropriate (or inappropriate) receptacle, then put it into your own gas tank. ; The operator of an Okie credit card will almost always start the syphon by sucking on it, rather than covering the end of it with his thumb, then pulling the hose out a way. After all, this is an OKIE credit card. ; Before the mid-1970s, you could use a length of garden hose for a Okie credit card. But in those dark days, Those Who Know What's Best for You and Me made the gas tank entrance holes much smaller. They said they did this to keep people from using unleaded gasoline, which was dispensed from a wide nozzle. But the real reason they did this was to make it harder to use an Okie credit card.
