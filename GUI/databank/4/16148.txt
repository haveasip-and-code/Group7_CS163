Placebo
An awesome band with a true english pixie(allright, a half american half scottish brit with an adorable figure that most girls would die for) who is the hottest guy alive after Ville Valo. Next comes the Bassist, who Placebo fans have come to know as Stef, who makes a great couple with Brian(The lead singer) Stef looks mysterious and sexy but is homosexual so good news for the gays bad news for the girls. And finally theres Steve who is the only straight memmember of the band so he misses out on all the gay fun, but non the less we all love him and Placebo would not exsist without him. ~satanas dixit~
