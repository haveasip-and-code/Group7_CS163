RabidWookie
This man has several dead bodies in his basement in his freezer. They aren't human bodies though, but rather T-Bone Steaks. [MTR] stopped over wanting a steak taco, but RabidWookie wouldn't share. ; RabidWookie is like that though, he saw [Wedge] wedged into the corner of his car and he didn't do anything about it.
