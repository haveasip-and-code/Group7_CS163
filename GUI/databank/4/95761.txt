nirvana complex
A common peronality complex seen in varying degrees in most humans where the subject is compelled to drink, take drugs or do whatever it takes to 'get out of their skull', feeling a momentary release or 'higher state of conciousness'. From children spinning round to get dizzy, to vomiting chavs and mushroom-munching hippies, we all love to laugh and stagger.
