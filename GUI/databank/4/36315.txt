pflange
Many believe 'flange' is the correct spelling, but it's simply a misuse of the glorious English language. 'Flange' is actually spelt, 'PFLANGE,' with a silent P. ; You know it makes sense. ; I was the first person to use it too. Anybody who denies that is simply a misuse of grammar jibing, misspelling fool! And hell YOU DON'T WANNA BE A MISUSE OF GRAMMAR JIBING, MISSPELLING FOOL!!! ; Oh, and it can mean anything you like.
