Breakcore
Breakcore was started by a bunch of weirdos obsessed with [IDM] and chaoticly structured beat noise. most blend the bounce of [Jungle] or [Drum and Bass], [Gabber] and [Powernoise] mayham together. ; Some producers rely on special EFX, for others it is there programming Geekness that prevails. It has become a highly technical programming genre that does NOT go against musical theory but shows that jumping to and from differnt time signatures is ridiculusly possible with a [Midi] or computer [Sequencer]. the human body cannot accelerate nor stop at the ratio of these extreme rates without damaging tissue. Many Non DJ's call this style [Drill and Bass] but that style is danceable, TOO head Nodable and friendly.
