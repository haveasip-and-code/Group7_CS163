Warlley
One of the most offensive words that can be used in east-cornwall, or in most of southern britain. Derived from the name 'Carlley', which was for a short time the nickname of a renegade farmhand who went on a killing rampage during the late 18th C. The pronounciation change to Warlly came about through the thick south England accent.
