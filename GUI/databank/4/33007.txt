Technological Heirarchy
A heirarchy consisting of five levels of computer knowledge: ; 1. Hackers: Any of the various people who can effectively program in more than 3 languages without referring back to a tutorial. Also, hackers have the capacity to access computers, but will only do it to expand the boundaries of knowledge. It is better to be considered a hacker than to consider yourself a hacker. ; 2. Crackers: Not to be confused with hackers, these people access computers and destroy the information on it, effectively damage it, or render it useless. Crackers are considered to be low-level people of vice by hackers, using their skills for evil where they could otherwise be a hacker. ; 3. Programmer: Any user who can effectively manage files and knows at least one programming language without having to refer back to a tutorial. Programmers may learn a system function, graphics design, or hardware as an alternative to a programming language. A programmer must often know enough about a computer to offer help or fix it if it breaks. ; 4. User: The standard user, who is capable of using a computer properly and knows enough to get himself or herself around. A user may need help if something should happen to the computer. ; 5. Newbie: A beginning user who has had no experience with a computer and normally needs assistance to do the usual tasks of a computer.
