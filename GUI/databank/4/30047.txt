civic
What muscle car fanboys always compare their cars to, or assume is the only Japanese car ever made, despite the existence of other Japanese cars that are much more suited for racing. ; That aside, a Civic is an economy car that yields good gas mileage (around 40 mpg). Unfortuantely, there are a handful of young reckless drivers out there who take their Civics and [rice] them out (read: rape them), giving Civics and their owners a bad name.
