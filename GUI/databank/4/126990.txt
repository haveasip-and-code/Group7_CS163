silverback
a state of mind where a person loses all human inhibitions and becomes a silverback gorilla. this is usually triggered when the potential silverback is subjected to intense clownage. indications of this phenomenon include a gorilla looking face and body and movement using all four limbs. extra body hair may appear and the silverback may slur some obscenties and make vulgar gestures. the phase only lasts about one minute, after that the silverback starts to laugh as though trying to play it off. also used as simply 'silver'. the first documented case of silverback was Geoff Hynson at Purdue University.
