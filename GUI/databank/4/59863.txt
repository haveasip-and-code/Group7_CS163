monkey hung
1. adj. A situation where two adolescent males are discovered naked by camera wielding adolescent females and in the mad scramble to cover their genitals, the boys grab the first thing they could find. Upon later examination of the photo evidence, it is learned that one boy grabbed a 3 foot tall trophy while the other boy grabbed a lame plaster statue of a surfing monkey. The term has grown to mean a feeling of ineptness. [Trophy Hung]
