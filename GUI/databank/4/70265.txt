Vash The Stampede
Vash the Stampede is a legendary gunman from the anime Trigun. He's reputation is not correct to his character. He will never kill anyone or let any one die in any circumstance no matter how the situation looks. There is only one person he has killed, and he is ever remorseful. Vash is a person that every one fears and no one be leaves that he is Vash because he is nothing like his reputation of destroying entire towns if he wants to, and killing thousands on a whim. He will intimidate any one to save a life.
