Castro
The gay district of San Francisco, sometimes referred to as a 'Gay Mecca.' Originally began in the 70s, when civil rights pioneer Harvey Milk became the first gay city official in the US. Murdered in city hall along with the mayor by a jealous competitor, who was later released after only a very brief sentence, leading to widespread outrage in the city. Now home to many gay individuals, businesses, restaurants, bars and clubs. Home to one of the biggest Pride celebrations, annually every summer.
