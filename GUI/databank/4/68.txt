quanta
A good band that sounds kinda like green day but a little heavier at times. They are very political and always singing about good stuff not breaking up with a girlfriend like most bands do these days. they sing about how the government is screwing them over because the dont want to be conformists and how its not fair people are rich for no reason and attack status symbols and populatity. The are anti-capitalism and pro anarchy (I think) and want to help the poor and stuff like that. Such nice guys.
