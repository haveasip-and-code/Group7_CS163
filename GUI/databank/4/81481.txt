mossad
Arguably the most incompetent intelligence organizations on the planet. The Mossad have botched up and ruined simple assassination attempts against several Arab targets. Mossad agents have in recent times been caught by Jordanian, Canadian, American and New Zealand authorities. They are spectacularly innefficient and sub-par as a spy agency. ; The Mossad have a long history of infiltrating Palestinian armed groups and believe that their success rate against an occupied nation without a standing army and military infastructure classify them as leading intelligence organization. They clearly are deluded beyond reason. ; The Mossad however is highly touted as a world leader in espionage, particularly because the Israeli media has an outstanding propaganda network that runs in the western world. Foreign media outlets owned by Jewish expats see [Rupert Murdoch] et [Conrad Black] have worked hard to ensure that Israeli government organizations are highly thought of in America.
