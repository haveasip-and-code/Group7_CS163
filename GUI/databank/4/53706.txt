camp tockwogh
A summer camp in Worton, MD for children and adolescents entering grades 4 to 11. Named for the Tockwogh tribe of Native Americans who lived in the region. Campers are divided into 'villages' depending on age and gender. Campers engage in activities that vary from canoeing and tennis, to perfecting the outdoorsy look, all which will assist in finding the perfect companion for the all camp dance. Campers look foward to the two dances each session, as well as two 'wet store' priviledges (unlimited candy and soda available for a reasonable price- a great oppurtunity to stock up for the rest of the session!), not to mention late night rendez-vous after dark on their cabin counselor's weekly night off, the traditional 'bra and underwear night' rush for girls, the sioux/ ute overnight sailing adventure, the sioux/ ute overnight sailing adventure, the chex mix removal from various body crevices, the nights slept in bathing suits, the iroq's 'sardines' cheer, and the singing of the shark song at the end of each bonfire. One last bitersweet thought to leave you with: 'Yeah Cho Beach!'
