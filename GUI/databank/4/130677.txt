durhee
a person who attributes trates similar to a [redneck] or a [hillbilly]. This commonly unknown word is often used to poke fun at these types of people without them being aware that they are being made fun of. The origins of the word originate from the sound made at a country music concert when a drunkin man gives off a yee-haw.
