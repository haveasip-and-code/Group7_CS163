flirtationship
when you flirt with a friend but eventaully it ends when their girlfriend/boyfriend tells you to back off or you eventaully realize that you and that person can be no more than friends and your just flirting when your together and you end up flirting with someone else later on (which can happen to be your friend too) and that cycle continues ...but there are some exceptions like maybe you start liking them but it turns out to be a mere flirtationship.. *heart broken*
