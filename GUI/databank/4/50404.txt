eburg
A boring small town in Maryland, properly named 'Eldersburg.' It's extremely safe, but there's nothing to do there except perhaps go visit the very large amount of surrounding farmland. Kids there, lacking almost any other fun things to do, frequently have parties and get drunk/high. Also known by high-school residents as 'The Burg.'
