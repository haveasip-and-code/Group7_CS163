circus circus
A Las Vegas hotel and casino on the northern end of the strip. Built in 1968, it was (and still is) geared mostly towards families with children. Known for having some of the cheapest hotel rooms on the strip. Various attractions at Circus Circus include Circus Acts, the Midway,and the Adventuredome, which is an indoor theme park. It is one of the older hotels on the strip, and it shows its age. Not as nice as say Caesars Palace, but still a very fun place to go. Could be renovated in 2006, or even demolished soon.
