rfjason
A LiveJournal user who exudes the ultimate in contrived humor in an attempt to feel internet-loved. Once took a month leave from the intarnet just so he could try to convince his intarweb chums that he turned born-again Christian. rfjason's antics are usually void of lulz. ; see: [loser], [ugly], [fugly], [pug-fugly],
