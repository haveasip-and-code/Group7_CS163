Mammy nun
Humanoid creature with dark skin, swollen potato-shaped head, duck bill, and medieval religimous costumery growing out their body. Mammy nuns are more or less undestructible. ; The Mammy Nuns were created by feeding mashed potatoes contaminated with synthetic mutagens to San Quentin prison inmates. ; Coined by Frank Zappa in the early eighties for his bizarre rock opera, 'Thing-Fish'.
