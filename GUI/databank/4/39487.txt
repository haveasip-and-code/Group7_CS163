The Perkins Effect
A dangerous social syndrome in which young, unsuspecting girls continue to find themselves attracted to an older, shifty boy, despite his obvious intentions to use them physically. The syndrome seems to be so far developed as to involve actual feelings of respect and admiration on the part of the young female victim.
