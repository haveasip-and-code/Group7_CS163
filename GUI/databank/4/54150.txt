The Best way to ... everything! Seriously you can program when you're: ; Sad, Happy, Dancing, Sweating, Running, Jogging, Sing, Eating a Banana, Listenning to Britney Spears, Ignoring a Britney Spears Concert, Sitting, Standing, Baby-Sitting, Baby-Standing, Dressing, Undressing, Looking, Feeling, Living (preferably), Dying (although you might have better things to be doing), searching, meeting, throwing, dazing, shooting, carpetting, doing homework, breaking, screwing, Distressed, disgruntled, angry, pressed, stressed, etc. You get the point. ; But I find it extremely useful right after a break-up.
