emo kid
Emo kids TRY to be unique, but are a uniform society. They all look the same, they sound the same, they dress the same, they listen to the same music. It's a homogeneous blend, if you will, of stupid teenagers attempting to be unique while falling into the very stereotypes they are trying to rebel from.
