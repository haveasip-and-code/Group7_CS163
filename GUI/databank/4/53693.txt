Blanow
A word used to vocalize while showing an example of a movement. Used at the exact time you re-enact the movement of others, or act with a movement yourself. Many times this word is used while you are grabbing at something, jacking something from a friend, or even tossing something comically. If the move takes a longer time than the word takes to say, it is customary to add extra 'anow's, but often, based on region, the N sound comes out the second and third times as an L sound, sounding like 'blanalalow'
