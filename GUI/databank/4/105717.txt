Breezertaal
Dutch slang referring to the usual chav/script-kiddie style of writing over IRC or MSN in distorted upper/lower-case (e.g., 'cHeCK iT oUt i cAnT uSE a kEyBoARD cuz iM kOoL'). While the word is generally used in Holland, the actual writing 'style' is to be encountered by IM-users anywhere around the world... generally because mindless chevs or ditzy 14-year old girls think it's 'cool' to write sentences that make a reader's eyes bleed.
