the college of new jersey
The college of new jersey is a pretty okay school. However, there is nothing to do on the weekends, and the parties become monotonous after a while. Nearby is beautiful and never scary or skeevy Trenton. There is absolutely no security on this campus so you can get into and out of this school very easily. Overall a pretty good place to be if you want to bring in alcohol to your dorm, because you're not cool enough to get into a party...
