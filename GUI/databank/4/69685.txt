BestDamnRapShow
Legendary man on boxden who cares nothing about what others think of him. In real life (outside of the internet) he would mostlikely first try to ignore you, then if bothered try to befriend you and nicely try to get away but would not hesitate to beat your ass to or nearly to death. Also found on the Efnet under a different alias.
