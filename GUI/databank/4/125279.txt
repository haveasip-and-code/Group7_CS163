Deflation
The feeling one gets after all the parental hype of your life gets swept away by reality. Usually after hichschool when you are no longer the most popular and the only college to accept you is Lost Dog Community College or Drunken State Univ. Also experienced after college when you realize- you are not going to be drafted by a pro sports team, no one cares where you graduated from, and your loans total 85K and your job pays 26K a year.
