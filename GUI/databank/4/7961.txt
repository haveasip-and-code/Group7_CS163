naquadah
Naquadah is an extremely useful metal used across the universe. The [Stargate] is composed of it and most [Goa'uld] technology utilizes it. The metal is so important that many planets' sole task is to mine it, as was the case on Abydos. The [SGC] uses naquadah in the form of a reactor to create large amounts of energy in a portable format.
