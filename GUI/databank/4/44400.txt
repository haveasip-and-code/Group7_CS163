e-thug
A shit stirring computer geek that only exists on the internet and thinks he is top shit by typing in capitals, swearing excessively and thinking they can kick your arse in a fight. ; In real life they are some pathetic, weak individual that can not go a day without linking real life situations with something that happens in a computer game. ; As a result, they are rejected by society because of their nature and should be disowned by their parents. ; If they did wanna fight you, they would probably tell you to go to LAN to meet them, sad cunts.
