Romantic
Apparently if a boy wines and dines you in the hopes you might later drain his testicles (Let's face it, it's the only reason) it's romantic (He pays for everything and you get him off .Sounds like low level prostitution to me, but whatever) However, simply hanging out with a boy isn't. Just another example of how badly Hollywood has fucked us over.
