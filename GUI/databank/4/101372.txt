FWOTLISCIOUS
Describes wings & other things that taste delicious. The word was derived from eating at a joint in Conshohocken/Norristown called FWOT (Fingers, wings, & other things). The chicken fingers are big, juicy, & delectable. The wings are very solid. I like the hot & blu dipping combo w/ them.
