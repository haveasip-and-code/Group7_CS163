Nikolai Fraiture
Oh, what a sweetheart. Nik is the amazing bassist of the amazing band The Strokes, coming from the big apple. Nikolai's quiet with a nice smile and a simple sense of humor. He doesn't seem to be quite so twisted as the rest of the Strokes. Don't get me wrong, I love the Strokes. But admit it - they are twisted. Yea, it's funny, but they're twisted :D. Anyway, you don't think of Nik as being funny, but if you watch the Strokes home vids on their website, or if you've seen In Transit, he's hilarious. I love Nikolai Fraiture!
