Alan Colmes
One ugly bastard; a weird-looking [liberal] pansy who is the co-host of FOX News' 'Hannity & Colmes'; the former name mentioned in the title of that show is the better one, of course. Is very ignorant of the truth, and doesn't get his facts straight before making his typical left-wing remarks. Speaking of typical, he is very ugly like the majority of [Democrats].
