UVA
the school you go to if you care about life after college. sure, i guess in the short run it pays to go to the college that wins all of its football games, because then you can brag about your football team to cover up how bad your school sucks, but then what happens after college? yep, you turn into an alumni who sucks balls, probably animal balls at that since you graduated with a degree in some type of farming from virginia tech. do you really need to go to school to learn how to plant things? anyway, students from UVA only seem stuck up to the people that didn't get in. deal with it. go play some football and be proud of your turkey mascot while i make the money and hump your mom...and never call her again.
