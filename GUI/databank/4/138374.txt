intellectual chess
Intellectual Chess is a drunken game which entirely not based upon regular [chess]. The game involves taking a large knife, spraying the blade with deodorant, setting fire to it, and then throwing it to each other (NB: throwing it to each other, not at each other.) Intellectual Chess has been played only once, and nobody was hurt.
