ramping
A relatively new feature on high-end paintball markers: ; The player simply presses the trigger 5 times a second for the first second, then the marker will speed up to a 15 balls per second rate of fire after the first second. ; This has caused much controversy as it is being allowed in some professional paintball leagues, even though fully automatic fire is not, and ramping, at its core, is not a semi-automatic rate of fire, the only rate of fire previously allowed. ; Ramping is generally considered a crutch of weak players and cheaters who don't have the skill or dexterity to shoot their markers at a fast rate of fire without having to rely on ramping or automatic fire.
