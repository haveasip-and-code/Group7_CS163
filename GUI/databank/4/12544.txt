Psytrance
Throbbing, pulsating, dripping music, in yummy layers of banging bliss. A form of hard electronic music that promotes a state of trance-like exstacy. Best listened to whilst under the influence of seriously wicked drugs, amongst the shrubbery of northern NSW...good times people..seriously good times...
