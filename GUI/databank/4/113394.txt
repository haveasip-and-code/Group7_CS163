Log Cabin Republicans
A confused, prideless group of homosexual men and women who, ironically, support homophobia by voting for homophobic republican candidates. Log cabin republicans claim to be changing attitudes toward homosexuals withing the republican party, but in reality, if they really want to help, they should simply change their red to blue.
