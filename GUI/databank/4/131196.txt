huorny
Used by true metalheads that are feeling like selling out/plagerizing. When they use this word they know that what they are thinking is wrong. Usually however, they are in the presence of at least one bandmate so that they may be given a good smack in the head or even beaten unconcious if there are enough bandmates around. derived from [huorn]
