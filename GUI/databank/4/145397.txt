Amy Grant
A gorgeous, [conservative], [Christian] artist who sings and plays guitar, and was born during the very early 1960s in Augusta, Georgia. She began her career and ascent into the Contemporary Christian Music world in the late 1970s. By the early 80s, she was a superstar. Finally, in 1985, secular music record producers were forcing record companies to let her make a secular, mainstream album. It was a great success; Unguarded was released that year and spawned the hits 'Find A Way' and 'Everywhere I Go'. The following year in 1986 saw the release of Amy's first compilation: Amy Grant - The Collection. It included two new secular songs and every other secular and Christian hit to date, including 'My Father's Eyes', 'El Shaddai', 'Sing Your Praise To The Lord', 'Emmanuel', 'I Have Decided', 'Thy Word', and 'Angels'. ; Amy reverted back to Christian music in 1988's album Lead Me On, which produced a new hit of the same name. However, with the dawn of the 90s, Amy was once again encouraged and influenced to make more mainstream secular pop. In 1991, she released Heart In Motion, probably her most successful album ever. It produced FIVE incredible hit songs that ruled the airwaves. ; Today she lives in Nashville, Tennessee with her husband, Vince Gill. With over a dozen albums and two compilations to call her own, she has been one of the greatest musicians ever in the history of the world, whether she was in or out of the Christian music scene, which she is currently back into today.
