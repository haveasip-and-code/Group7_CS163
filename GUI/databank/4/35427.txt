tore out the frame
This lil' gem originated in west side Lawrenceville, Georgia. It was coined by the fattest, blackest, lamest man you ever saw. He was staying at that cheap hotel at the intersection of I-85 and Lawrencevill/Suwannee Rd. In a drunken stooper, he walked to the [Starship] next door and ran out the door wiith about $400 worth of adult videos that he had 'forgotten' to pay for. When confronted by the police, he claimed he was 'tore out the frame' on that red dog beer. Yeah, this guy is a loser.
