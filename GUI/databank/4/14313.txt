Honger
Honger (n.) ; A person from Hong Kong. Usually used in a derogatory sense by anyone who is not part of the Honger population. Normally speaks in Cantonese, and has a heavy accent when speaking in English. Normally spotted wearing clothes popular in Asia with dyed/streaked hair, speaking in loud voices on their cell phones. Also spotted in expensive cars. Reads Japanese comics ([Manga]) and plays video games. Frequents 'Asian' arcades, with games such as Dance Dance Revolution and Initial D. Strangely, all Hongers seemed to have mastered DDR, or at least play it competently. Likes cute icons, which manifest themselves in everything from toilet paper to cellphone accessories. Usually wears or brings enough accessories with them to open a store, including things such as braclets, necklaces, cellphones, and/or mp3 players. When communicating on the internet, they tend to 'talk lik dis ar'. Contrary to popular belief, not all Hongers get good grades.
