roundboy
Refers to the Abercrombie & Fitch frat-boy type. Typical traits include some kind of choker necklace, blonde hair (usually dyed), some kind of unoriginal tattoo (typically tribal), a dark tan, a false air of self-importance and an outfit costing two to three times the wearer's IQ. Like a circle, one roundboy is the same as the next - the only difference is the size.
