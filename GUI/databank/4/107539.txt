Lusankya
A Super Star Destroyer, or [SSD], in the fictional Star Wars galaxy. Built by the Emperor under the code name Executor, it served as his private escape ship and was buried under [Coruscant]. After the Battle of Endor, Ysanne Isard, the Director of Imperial Intelligence, made of [Coruscant] with it, killing millions in the process. It was later captured by the New Republic, taken secretly into a shipyard, and restored to full power. It served the New Republic until it was sent on a suicide mission against a Yuuzhan Vong worldship some 20 odd years later, where the Lusankya was jury rigged with droids and purposely crashed into the worldship, destroying both ships.
