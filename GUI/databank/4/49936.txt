IGE
An acronym for 'Internet Gaming Entertainment,' a company notorious for selling gaming currency and items to MMORPG players that are willing to spend their real money for it. ; The people that actually earn this money in-game are generally in some form of debt or poverty (but oddly enough, they can afford to buy the computer or console on which the game is played). They almost never speak to the other players and are almost always seen in large crowds trying to take advantage of something that gives a lot of in-game money. They detract from the fun and experience of the game and bring us to the harsh reality that a wonderful game, no matter how wonderful, is just a collection of 0s and 1s designed to entertain the human race and nothing more. ; Needless to say, big-name companies like Square Enix need to put these people out of business already. It's becoming rediculous seeing gilsellers swarming great games left and right trying to feed their starving families by taking advantage of the laziness and stupidity of other people.
