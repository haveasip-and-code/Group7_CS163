Track
A sport that has the hottest babes on the planet. Those who disagree just have not gone to a large invtational meet. (Penn Relays, The Armory, etc). Its also one of the most diffcult sports to do, as its a high impact sport on your knees, and can destroy your body if you do it incorrectly long enough. But its also one of the few high school sports in which you win metals, which rule.
