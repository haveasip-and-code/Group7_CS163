Series Finale
(N.) The final episode of a TV series where all mysteries are solved and all questions are usually answered. ; Most Series Finales come from arrogant networks canceling their time-tested quality shows for 'New Viewers' and do not happen by choice. Only when a long-overdue-for-canceling show (Like '[Friends]') decides to actually stop doing episodes anymore, are Series Finales by choice. ; A Series Finale doesn't count if a show has been on for less than One Season, or 13-22 episodes. So '[The Will]', '[DotComedy]', or '[Life On A Stick]' would not offically have a 'Series Finale.'
