anime nerd
Liking anime isn't so bad, but it is if all you ever do is talk about anime, read manga, and act like you're a 6-year-old in need of a baby-sitter. These people generally hang out in groups at lunch and discuss anime and manga while talking in childish made-up voices. Some of them try to stand out by wearing clothes from Hot Topic so they can be neo-nerds. They also usually take web design/graphic design classes and become [teacher's pet]s to the teachers who are into technology. It's a sad concept indeed.
