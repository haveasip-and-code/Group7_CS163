Weather Report
A jazz band from the the '70s, Weather Report was made up of pianist [Joe Zawinul] and saxophonist [Wayne Shorter], with a lot of others coming in and out in rotation. Some members that have gone through include the late great [Jaco Pastorius], who was a virtuoso at bass. They went through a string of drummers, including Alphonse Mouzon, Eric Gravatt, Greg Errico, Leon 'Ndugu' Chancler, and Chester Thompson. ; Oh yeah, and their album 'Heavy Weather' fucking kicks!
