California left
The method of turning left on a street that forbids left hand turns. You drive through the intersection, turn right at the next intersection, and continue around the block with two more right turns until you end up going in the left-hand direction you wanted to travel in the first place. So named because of 19th Avenue in San Francisco--a long stretch of road that forbids left hand turns.
