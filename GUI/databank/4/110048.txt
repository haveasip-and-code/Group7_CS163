roll-sidle
When a big-time consultant physically rolls his office chair into your cube (or office) to annoy you with something pointless. The result is usually a feeling of anger and physical harm is entirely possible. This is different from a regular 'sidle' which does not include a chair, but rather where the BTC (big time consultant) lingers annoyingly for no reason. Think of Lumbergh in 'Office Space' rolling up 'Peter... what's happening!'
