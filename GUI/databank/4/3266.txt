chayse
A very lanky person, who is a nut on a pushbike who favours hillybilly tendencies, namely playing the banjo and being a goon. He thinks he is a hardcore trials rider but he is far from it and should give up right now before making an ass of himself. Often seen building pushbike jumps in dirty clothing.
