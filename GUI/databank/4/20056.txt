Spunk doodle
The spunk doodle was first invented by Rolf Harris, who discovered the technique after accidentally spilling some ejaculate onto a piece of paper following a wank. The [spunk] ascertaining to a spunk doodle can be dyed by using natural vegetable dyes or for the more adventuous artists out there, shit. Rolf has master(bat)ed this this technique and is giving a live workshop demonstration at the July 2005 bodily fluids expo. If you are interested in attending please write a letter (sealing the envelope with ejaculate) adressed to ; Rolf Harris, ; The Australian cock art institute, ; Wankington ; PO BOX 69 WANK
