the streets
most innovative amazing urban artists to come out of the UK for a long time. not many people can relate to their music purely because it is aimed at us working class 18-30 year olds who have tried illicit substances, drank to the brink and got in fights. however Could Well Be In is my fave off the second album and its me and my bfs 'Song'! something a bit different, eh???
