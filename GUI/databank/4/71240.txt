niggerchanovsky
A funny fuckin word that comes up on auto-complete when text messaging the 'n' word (aka [nigger]) with Motorola's iTap texting mode. After you manually input the 6 letters of the word, the suffix of 'chanovsky' should appear. I have no clue what the shit this means, but it definitely had me laughing my ass off when my cell phone threw it out there. It's probably even funnier when you're [bent].
