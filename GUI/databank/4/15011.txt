Willie Pete
A grenade which explodes into a cloud of White Phosphorouse and burns all flammable objects within its blast radus. The name comes from the WP (which stands for White Phosphorous) after the military name, but in Vietnam, soldiers just took the WP and made it Willie Pete. When combined with psycopathic terrorists, Willie Petes makes for tons-o-fun! Just light 'em up and watch 'em burn!
