crunkopoly
A variation of [Monopoly] rules in which the object is for all players to become drunk and naked. Landing on railroads, in jail, or passing go requires a player to take a shot. If a player lands on another's unimproved property, they roll a die and remove an article of clothing if they land a one. The numbers on the dice requiring stripping increase with each house or hotel; one house means a one or a two will cause stripping, two houses means a one, two or three, and so on. If someone lands on free parking, they can either put on an article of clothing or force all other players to remove one. All other rules of Monopoly apply. Everybody wins.
