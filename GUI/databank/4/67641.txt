Moogs
A nickname to give to a person in your group if there are two people of the same name. For example is there are two Samanthas in your group, and you are to lazy to call one Samantha A and the other Samantha B, re-name one 'Moogs'. ; This name is also a nickname used for only the best of the best of the best friends. Do not use this name flippantly however, because it signifiys both awsomeness, and an un-wavering [kick ass] personality.
