Half Life 2
Set apart from other games in its AI, graphics and physics engines. At what part in Halo can you pick barrels up and slam them into the enemies, when in Pariah do the enemies retreat, try to outflank you and generally don't commit suicide, and in UT2004, is Nikata's arse really as round as alyx's? ; No, none of you can truly say that Half-Life 2 is a disappointment, after all, you thought it was so good it deserved urban dictionary's attention, didn't you?
