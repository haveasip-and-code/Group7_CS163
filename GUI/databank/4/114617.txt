pacific mall
Pacific Mall - Located at Kennedy and Steeles, it is known to every Chinese person living in Toronto. In there, you can find anything from jewellery,CDs and DVDs,and up to rice rocket car parts. BEWARE: when driving there, be sure to watch out for mid-aged Chinese women who cannot run stop signs, and civics plastered with 'MUGEN POWERED' stickers that sound like a lawnmowers and have engines with displacement less than a 2L Coke bottle.
