Hyderabad
A city in south-central India, home of the infamous Char Minar. If you're from here, you're cool. If not, you suck. ; Hyderbadi are known to be very lazy (or as we like to say 'laid-back'), never on time, and basically loafers. ; But, gee golly whiz, When we want to and when we put our minds to it, we own your mom!
