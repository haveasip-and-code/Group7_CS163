abortion
The removal of an unborn baby. ; Really, in the physical life, there is nothing wrong with abortion. Though it is seen as just purely wrong to abort a baby when the woman having it was simply having sex without protection and not caring, most see it wrong because of their religious beliefs. Since the Bible hasn't so touched up on the subject of abortion directly, people have seen it fit for them to add to the scriptures and such and call it murder, which in fact is wrong according to the Bible. ; Really, abortion is considered right overall when it is found that the baby will die along with the wife, will be born into a life a pain, or is the product of rape, but even here many 'Pro-lifers' insist this is wrong and that it is murder and want it banned, when it simply starts up the same protestes from 'Pro-choicers' and 'Back alley' abortions. ; 'Pro-choicers' also say that if abortion is wrong, then maturbation is wrong (Which is 'unclean' to the Bible, not a sin, incase you don't know). Though yes, this is the death of sperm itself, most 'Pro-Lifers' say that this is only half of the equation for life, and doesn't count. ; All in all, I have this to say to you women out there: ; It doesn't matter if it's your choice at the moment. Don't be a whore. Use protection. You'll only need to do this when you really have to, and only unknowing, extremist 'Pro-lifers' will oppose your decisions, which are a matter of death without it anyways. ; If you fall into the religious category, and you cannot go about through life with a child without bringing pain to the baby, you, and others, put it up for adoption. ; Not only is it a bit more 'moral', but it won't be murder, and all in all, adoption is always a much more viable choice.
