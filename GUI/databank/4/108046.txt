Dr Dre
Dr. Dre was first known when he started making music in a group known as the ''World Class Wreckin' Kru''. He then moved on to the gangsta rap super group called N.W.A. Here it was made obvious that he was a much better producer than a rapper and after the group split up, he made his own music with the help of Snoop Dogg, Suge Knight and many other producers and artists. After making albums like 'The Chronic' and '2001' he was known as the best rap/hip hop producer ever, and still is today, the only other producer who would stand a chance against his skill is DJ Premier, but in my eyes he still is and always will be the best producer ever.
