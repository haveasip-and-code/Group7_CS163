Balrog
He is a boxer from Street Fighter. Balrog, is big, dumb...and really, really strong. He is a world-champion professional boxer who's primary motivations include money, women, and living the high life. He's the only Street Fighter character who can't kick, and was the first Boss character you encounter in Street Fighter II. In the Japanese version, his name was M.Bison. It was changed to avoid any legal entanglements with Mike Tyson, who bears a striking resemblance, has his own game and is certainly no stranger to legal hassles.
