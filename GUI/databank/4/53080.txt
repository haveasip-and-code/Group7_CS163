C.A.P.
Cap, a take on the ever popular 'Jap' (Jewish American Princess), is simply a Christian girl raised in a jewish envrionment who wants nothing more than to be jewish. She owns the usual Jewish clothing staples- Juicy, Kate Spade, Seven Jeans, Citizens of Humanity, Coach, Louis Vutton, etc. etc. She straighens our her already basically straight hair, unlike that of her jewish, curly haired counterparts. She is taller than the average jew, and wishes to be slightly shorter so she too could smash her feet into 4 in heels and not tower over NJB's (nice jewish boys). Jewish mothers accept these women like they would a JAP, and reconize them as one of their own. These women will marry Jews, and assimilate into Jewish society by converting and raising proper whiney jewish children.
