mall goth
If all these kids are *fake* goth, what's *real* goth? Are they fake because they're young? Because they like bands that more than 3% of the population have heard of? Because they like to wear black? ; Is it bad to experiment with styles and music, especially when you're a teenager? Who defines *true* and *fake* anyway?
