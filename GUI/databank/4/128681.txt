slapped cheek disease
a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill child typically has a 'slapped-cheek' rash on the face and a lacy red rash on the trunk and limbs. Occasionally, the rash may itch. An ill child may have a low-grade fever, malaise, or a 'cold' a few days before the rash breaks out. The child is usually not very ill, and the rash resolves in 7 to 10 days.
