Greenville
a small town in Northern Delaware home to a bunch of rich people, kind of like Newport Beach, CA only 10 times smaller. The kids get bored and go to [Hockessin] or happy harry's in their parents' cars unless they are crashing them. The old people live in Stonegates (the retirement community) which covers about 90% of the popuation. The parents are too busy working, throwing elaborate parties, getting divorces, or drinking scotch to look out for their kids' habits and social behavior. Greenville is the only place in the tristate area that doesn't have a [Wawa] or [McDonalds]. There's a really boring museum and lots of white people. In fact, the only black person you really see is the manager at Happy Harry's, who likes to hit on his employees. Local activities include bridge night, [beer pong] and spending large amounts of money on Ebay.
