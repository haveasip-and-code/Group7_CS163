Xenos
See [hermaphrodite]. Xenos, an abbreviation for 'Xenogenesis,' is an [androgynous], but strangely alluring creature. Its voluminous amount of intelligence and logic make it highly respected in the world of both females and males. A chatty, gossipy creature, Xenos is prone to asking [random] questions in order to obtain obscure information. Not easily flattered, Xenos is hard to enrapture and obtain as a mate, although it does have an affinity for a [Sabredog].
