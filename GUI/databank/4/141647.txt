taste the happy
a phrase originated on the Fox sitcom [Arrested Development]. It means roughly 'you've made me so happy' or 'join me in being happy'. The character of G.O.B. Bluth once begged his brother to 'taste the happy' and pushed his face up against him, trying to get him to taste his tears of happiness.
