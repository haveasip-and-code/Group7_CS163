Ghouse
AKA 'The G'. A clan originally named Tamachi by its infant creator. It first started off as an online gaming clan to recruit the few humans around the world who were worthy of the glory of the G. As time progressed, Ghouse broke out of the realm of cyberspace and launched itself into the real world; where it now gradually influences and assimilates Mother Earth into its eternal grandeur.
