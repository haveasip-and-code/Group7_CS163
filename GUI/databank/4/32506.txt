hambone
Term given to male college students who are jocks, gym-rats, beer-drinkers or business majors. They generally attend frat parties and always wear a collared shirt tuck neatly into thier pants. Hambones will engage in debates with other hambones that consist of 'which are the best Dave Matthews Band lyrics' or the cheapest place to buy a '30-rack of Pabst Blue Ribbon.' You can spot hambones driving Jeep wranglers and at the gym discussing with their hambone buddies about the girl they hooked up with the night before.
