Peruvian buckles
Ornamental and fucntional fastners for shoes, pants, jackets, car doors, and, sometimes, books on shadow boxing. Built by descendents of the Cat people of Peru, these buckles are often built out of rubies, silver, or from spaceship wreckage. In addition to this, some of the buckles can sell for well over $35.
