chuckle without the chunks
To issue an unintentional fart (or series thereof) when laughing uncontrollably at an unexpected funny moment. Importantly, this is not followed by 'following through', which would spoil the moment, hence 'no chunks'. Often associated with ejecting beer, etc from the nose at funny moments.
