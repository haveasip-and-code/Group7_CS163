gaijinshi
A derogatory term that describes a style of art, be it drawn, animated or otherwise, that emulates [anime] and [manga] but is neither produced in Japan or by a Japanese person. ; The term is a combination of the words [gaijin], which means foreigner, or (more accurately) 'non-Japanese', and [doujinshi], a Japanese word for amateur-produced comics. ; The term is used mostly when referring to the massive amount of embarrassingly poor drawings that are uploaded to the [deviantart] community by [wapanese] nerds. However, it can also be used to describe professionally produced comics and animation. Examples include the comic 'The Boondocks', and the cartoons 'Teen Titans' and 'Avatar: The Last Airbender.'
