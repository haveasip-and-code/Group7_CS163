The Creek
The creek or stream near a neighborhood that little kids play in and/or teens do drugs in. You will seldom find adults in by the creek. Often times there will be some woods surrounding it and maybe a path formed from people walking there. Many times there will be trash thrown in or around the river, from old Sega Genisis to candy wrappers.
