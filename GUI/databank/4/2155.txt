Yuu Yuu Hakusho
Yes, There are 2 U's on each Yuu, look on the title frames. Theres a Yu and a U on both...anyway ; In Japanese, this has 2 meanings, neither of which is wrong or right when it comes to the anime ; The first is Astral Visit Report , coming from the Kanji for Ghost and the kanji for blank paper, also used for report or essay. ; The other is Record of Yuusukes Journey. This is derived from the fact that the Yuu Kanji in the title is the same as in Yuusukes name(Yuusuke means Ghost helper).
