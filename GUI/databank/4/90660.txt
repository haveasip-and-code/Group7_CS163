Grand Teton
A national park created in 1950 largly due to the generosity of the rockefeler family. Gigantic breath taking mountains with georgeous lakes at their base. The name comes from the french fur trappers who, after being in the wilderness for several years saw the mountains and thought they looked like breasts. Grand=big Teton=breast
