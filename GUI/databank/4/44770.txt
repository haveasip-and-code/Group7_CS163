The Hill School
Founded in 1851 the Hill School, once an all boys boarding school, turned coed in 1997. Since the change the school mutated into a sick torture chamber of cruel an unusual punishment. Students enjoy a wide variety of sports, academics, and thinking up countless ways to end their lives. Free time at The Hill consists of a few precious minutes of sitting in your dorm room waiting for your life to start. Any attempts at having any fun whatsoever are futile, since the administration will find fault in even the most innocent of acts. You will be DC-ed or HC-ed and most likely suspended or kicked out. Thus ruining all your chances to get into a decent college. But don't worry, maybe the team of highly trained college advisors will use their ties with those facilities of 'higher education' such as West Chester University to get you back on track. The Hill School often characterized as a prison cell; most people would rather walk into on coming traffic than spend more than few hours in this hellhole. And those who do enjoy The Hill include in the 75% of the population who are complete and utter faggots.
