bootwork
Martial arts' kicking expertise, usually used in reference to performers in Hong Kong martial arts films. A fine use of legs and kicking (as opposed to flips, punches, wire-fu etc) is called bootwork. Usually this occurs when the performer is actually trained in kickboxing or taekwondo rather than wushu or Peking Opera.
