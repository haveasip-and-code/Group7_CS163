Violent J
Violent J is just one of the two members of ICP respectively known as the Insane Clown Posse. His real name is Joseph Bruce and was part of the group formerly known as the Inner City Posse which has now been changed to the Insane Clown Posse and has been reformed to have only two members known as Violent J and of course Shaggy 2 Dope. J and Shaggs have been through many record labels including that of Disney which was one hell of a deal to get out of. Presently J and Shaggs and the rest of the Psychopathic family (Twiztid, Zug Island, Psychopathic Rydas, and aslo Anybody Killa aka ABK, ect.) have their own record label which is depicted by the Hatchetman. Now J and Shaggs have one hell of a fan base with family known as Juggalos and Juggalettes. Their family has now reached over 1 million Juggalos and Juggalettes world-wide. Give it up for the Hatchet.
