Console Fanboy
A [fanboy] who plays only console video games. The only PC games they'll touch are free (and often terrible) ones, such as [Gunbound], [Runescape], or [Kings of Chaos]/[Outwar]. ; The console fanboy is bitter towards anyone who prefers PC gaming, as their chugging, ten year old [486] running [Windows 95] with a dialup connection is so completely obsolete that they can barely load their internet browser, let alone play a game. ; Tries to back up their crippling lack of technology by denouncing the keyboard/mouse setup as 'too hard to use' or lamenting that online PC gaming lacks some kind of close social aspect that only being in the same room can apparently provide (never mind the presence of [voice chat] or the [LAN party]). ; The console fanboy can often be made to see the error of their ways as long as a slight amount of force is used.
