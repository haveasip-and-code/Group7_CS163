nipple slip
'tis when a woman's nipple gets real claustrophobic and sticks its head out for a deep breath, while the woman does not notice at first. This is very common with actresses. Their nipples get nervous a lot, and need some air sometimes. A lot of the time, they stick their head out, and decide that they like all the attention so they linger longer than needed. This usually causes embarassment.
