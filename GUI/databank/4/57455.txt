Zen Micro
A micro drive MP3 player made by Creative. Comes in 10 different colors (more than the [iPod Mini]). First models were 5 GB but new 4 & 6 GB models are now available. Also has a blue backlit trim which glows when the 12 hour, removable, rechargeable battery is charging. Those who haven't been brainwashed by [Apple] know the Zen Micro is the superior MP3 player.
