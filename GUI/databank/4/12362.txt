Draco Malfoy
[Harry Potter]'s supposed 'arch-nemesis' in the series by [J.K. Rowling]. Blond, arrogant, rich and devoted to making all Gryffindors' (particularly Harry and co.) lives hell as often as possible. Usually accompanied by his brute lackeys Crabbe and Goyle. His father [Lucius Malfoy] is a certified P.I.M.P. with that snake-head cane. ; Personally, we think he's dead sexy, but regrettably admit to being biased because of our [Tom Felton] fanhood. Harry/Draco, bitches.
