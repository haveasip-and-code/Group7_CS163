rsx
slowest piece of shit ever to hit the road. Honda's biggest multi billion dollar mistake ever. Small companies tried to overcome this fact by producing line of turbos and after market performance parts in order to level the balance of shittyness. They were only to find that what would turn any normal car into a dream car, made the rsx even worse.
