bilt
To me the word BILT is something that cannot be argued with. I feel that the word BILT has been a word that has incredibly developed over the years, becoming a word that is used everyday language. The word BILT means to develop the muscles over your body to to point where they are ripped 24 hours a day, without a doubt! If you are BILT you dont even have to flex to show off your muscles. They are just there. BILT is also a way of describing someone who is rather large, or big - In a none negative way, use BILT to describe a larger person. But in all reason BILT should be used in context with muscles.
