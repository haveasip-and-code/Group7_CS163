sobro
Based on previous definitions, Sobro is a place only a high school student could care about or take pride in. It would appear to be occupied by a number of pretentious spoiled youth with nothing better to do than attempt to impress people on the internet. ; It's also a place where apparently a lot of people have yet to learn that in real life, no one cares where you went to high school or what town you came from. If you're lucky you'll live in a backwoods-enough place that people might 'respect' you for you last name, but only if your rich daddy lives there too.
