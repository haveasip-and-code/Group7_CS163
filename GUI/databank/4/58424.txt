bellydance
An ancient dance of the goddess by Arabian women for women. This dance was performed for pregnant women at fertility rites and such. Today, however, bellydance is associated with scantilly-clad women dancing for rich sultans. ; This dance includes many undulations of the belly, arms, and pelvis. Visits to Arabic countries include bellydancers performing at many parties, weddings, and cafes, to be enjoyed by both women and men.
