nintendo 64
The nintendo 64 was an awesome console and still is. I remember growing up on this thing. I got it when i was 5 when it first came out and had it for a while. It had so many good games like: Super Mario 64, Mario Kart, Zelda(s), James Bond: Golden eye and so many others. I had so many fond memories with the N64. I would rent a game almost every week and try to beat it before I had to give it back. I rented Goldeneye like 11 times it was so much fun. I wish I never got rid of it. It is so much better than the new ones, it may not look as good, but the games are alot better.
