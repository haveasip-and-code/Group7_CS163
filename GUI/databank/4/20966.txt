davie county
A small county in North Carolina, located between Iredell and Davidson Counties. A very rural area, although it is steadily increasing in numbers, due to the rising Hispanic community. Separated into the 'North' and the 'South,' where those in the north are considered rich and snobby, especially in the communites of Bermuda Run and Hillsdale, and those in the south are considered average, everyday people, those who have better things to do than complain about their Mercedes and BMW's not having enough gas. ; The county is separated even more by towns, where the county seat is the town of Mocksville, and your trashier, skankier, and redneck-ier people reside in the town of Cooleemee. You also have Woodleaf, where it's just racist rednecks there. ; There's absolutely NOTHING to do in Davie County, so most people either end up traveling to neighboring cities such as Statesville or Winston-Salem.
