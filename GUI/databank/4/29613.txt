Lil Wayne
Very ugly, little troll like figure. Who will now, because of the new Destiny's Child song 'Soldier'. ; Also be known commercially outside the US. ; Has a sort of slow-rap style that makes little babies want to sleep. ; Has no real skills, except for maybe playing Gollum one day. If Spike Lee ever decided to do an Urban LOTR version.
