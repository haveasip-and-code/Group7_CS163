Bob Jones University
Crazy people. No physical contact between couples, couples can't leave campus together without a chaperone, no one can listen to rock, jazz, country, christian rock, or play video games rated T or above or that have rock music in them. Obviously, no gays (not condoning), Christian fundamentalism of the worst sort. Ugghh! Oh, also not accredited.
