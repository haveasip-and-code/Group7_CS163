AIDs
AIDs is a disease that breaks down your immune system. It is HIV in its later form. Nobody has ever died purely because of AIDs, something else kills you after AIDs has weakened you. This is why AIDs is such a horrible disease--it opens the doors and makes it so anything--even a cold--could kill you. ; AIDs is blood transmitted, making it an STD. However, before they were able to test for it, you could get it from infected blood transplants. ; There is no known cure for aids--yet. There is hope, though, as the prostitutes in Africa are immune to it. We know that it is possible to fight it. ; AIDs's origin is not clear. We think it was a problem in the monkey kingdom, but then somebody ate infected monkey meat, got the virus, and spread it. ; AIDs is not a punishment for the homosexuals. Strait people get it too. AIDs is not gender, race, sexuality, or age specific. Just because you're a strait, white, male doesn't make you immune. Anyone can get it. ; Best way to prevent it: know who you're sleeping with.
