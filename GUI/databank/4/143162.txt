Collegiate
Collegiate is a place where guys can hang out with girls freely, and enjoy each others company. This is contrary to Collegiate's rival school, St. Christophers where all they have time to do is gloat about how pretty each others flowing hair and matching fluorescent costumes look, because there are no girls to do this job. The life of a Collegiate student is a life lived to the fullest, dominating in outstanding athletic and academic achievements, as well as dominating the competition on having a good time, which is why the Saint Catherine's girls join the Collegiate girls, leaving the boys to give each other their own kind of fun.
