By far the most exclusive and all white country club in the tri state area. All the moms play tennis at least 3 days a week, and the fathers play 18 holes of golf almost as frequently. The children are all in the preppiest and private schools around and spend every day of the summer when they are not sailing on their family's yacht in the Mediteranian, either playing golf, tennis, or swimming. The only cars that are under $50,000 belong to the help and seeing a famous face there is nothing new. Also, the sight of the U.S. Open in 1997 and former U.S. presidents are former country club presidents.
