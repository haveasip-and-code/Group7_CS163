the C word
It pains me to utter it because the FBI will probably investigate me for it, but the C word refers to 'Christmas.' Originally derived from the Roman Saturnalia (observed on the winter solstice) and still viewed by some as a pagan holiday, in 2005 it was made illegal to say this word when preceded by the word 'merry.' Also, according to federal law, if anyone now directs the dread term 'Merry Christmas!' towards a non-Christian, the mandatory minimum punishment is 20 lumps of coal for Christmas, as well as castration (it is a sort of forced New Year's resolution that you will give up your sexuality, male or female). In accordance with the law, in 2005 President George W. Bush sent out 'Christmas' cards which simply read 'Happy Holidays!' This is now the official legal term for the time of year between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. Acceptable alternatives are 'Merry Festivus!,' 'Yo bitch, hava bomb ass Kwanza!,' and 'Happy Boxing Day!' (None of the three deal with religion, so they are legally acceptable now).
