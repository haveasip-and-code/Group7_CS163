shtizz
Amiable replacement for sh*t, shtizz derives from the Snoop Dogg era circa 1993, where the double 'z' was used often in his prose and poems set to rhythm (G-Funk). Like sh*t, shtizz is a multi-purpose word. It can be used derogatorily but more often than not it is principally summoned to praise something spellbinding. It also signifies understanding.
