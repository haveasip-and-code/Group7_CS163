apple pipe
An apple [pipe] is a makeshift smoking device. To make one only requires an apple and a pen/pencil and about 30 seconds of time. ; Step 1) Pull out the stem of the apple. ; Step 2) The indentation in the middle of the apple (where the stem was) is the bowl. Push the pen/pencil halfway through the apple, but DO NOT go all the way to the bottom. ; Step 3) Remove the pen/pencil and shove it straight through the apple perpendicular to the hole you just made. This creates the mouthpiece and the carb. ; Step 4) Pack the bowl, smoke, and enjoy!
