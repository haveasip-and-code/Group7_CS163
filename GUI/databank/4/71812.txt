B.G. Knocc Out
Underrated Gangsta Rapper. ; B.G. Knocc Out was raised by a single mother and his older brother 'Gangsta Dresta', who looked after him most of the time. They grew up on the streets of Compton. A city known for it's violent Police Department and Gang related crimes. B.G. Knocc Out was said to be a member of the East Compton Crips, but that has not been confirmed. ; The both of them were affiliated with Eazy E, the Godfather of Gangsta Rap, and featured in the hit 'Real Muthaphukkin Gs' along with other tracks such as 'Ole School Shit', and 'Sippin on a 40'. ; B.G. Knocc Out & Gangsta Dresta ended up releasing their only Album to date 'Real Brothas'. ; Despite the facts that Eazy E didn't feature on the album, and there was absolutely no promotion of the Album, it resulted in selling approximately 200.000 copies. ; When Eazy E died of AIDS (R.I.P), B.G. and Dresta virtually lost all chances of being signed to the record label 'Ruthless Records'. ; Unfortunately, after all these tribulations, B.G.
