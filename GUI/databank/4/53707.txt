Osterville  Ma
Osterville, MA. is the place to be from memorial day till labor day people will drive for an entire day from Fl or MI just to spend a week, there are no cops on land the only person to bust u for anything is the habor master. Pretty much every one there is an English Yankee. The people that belong to the Wianno club are stuck up and if u wanna have fun u gotta hang out with the yatch club kids.
