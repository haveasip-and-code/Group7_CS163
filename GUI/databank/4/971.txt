Tamer Brad
A Canadian teenager often persecuted for being honest and speaking his mind. Often persecuted for being correct, and making sure the idiots he may be correcting get the point loud and clear so that it doesn't happen again, which can make him seem unecessarily direct. But it works. When he goes too far, he apologizes which is also often misinterpreted. ; The best way to deal with Brad is to act like a normal person who can use correct spelling and grammar, he simply asks that you don't be an asshole and don't type like you have the intelligence of a fruit fly on crack.
