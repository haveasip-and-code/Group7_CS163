plx
What noobs say when they cant be bothered or dont know how to say 'please'. ; Note that plx doesnt have any vowels and also does not even 'sound' like it has vowels, like the word 'rhythm'. This means that plx actually isn't a true english word. So when people say this, you can actually ask them to speak in english. If they get confused, call them noobs.
