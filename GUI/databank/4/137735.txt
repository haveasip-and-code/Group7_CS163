Coldplay
A band from Britain containing four powerful and intelligent members, Chris Martin (vocals), Jon Buckland (guitar), Guy Berryman (bass) and Will Champion (drums). Originally called Starfish, they first hit it big with their song 'Yellow' which is on their debut album, Parachutes. Since their first album in 2000, they have released two more sensational albums, recently releasing X&Y which became the best-seller in Europe and America. ; Coldplay gets a lot of crap from people who dislike them. It's either you love Coldplay or you hate Coldplay. However, Coldplay writes very philosophical lyrics and people complain and say that they want to be the next U2, but they sound nothing like U2, but they sound like Radiohead, but both bands are still stellar. ; Chris Martin is currently the poster child for the Make Trade Fair charities and for OXFAM.
