Honors English
A course in which supposed honors- worthy students are placed in, when in reality half the students are just 'good kids.' An overwhelming amount of reading is assigned, followed by a lot of essay-writing. It doesn't matter whether the students read the books, or used [sparknotes] to finish the reading assignments. All that matters is that it can be stated that the students read 'x' amount of books during the school year.
