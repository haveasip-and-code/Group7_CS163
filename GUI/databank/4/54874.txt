Evanescence
A tragically underestimated rock band hailing from Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S. Often known by idiots for 'calling themselves gothic,' 'ripping off Lacuna Coil,' and other overconformed demi-insults. Most known for the songs 'My Immortal' and 'Bring Me to Life.' People generally forget that Evanescence has a large collection of songs pre-Fallen. ; Ev have covered many songs, most notably 'Tourniquet' ('My Tourniquet') by Soul Asylum and 'Thoughtless' by Korn.
