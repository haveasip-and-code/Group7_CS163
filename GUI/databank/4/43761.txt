the smallest of small towns populated largely by old lady boutiques and antique shops. Houses more than its fair share of [WASPs] who have ridiculously large amounts of income. Subsequently, such rare species as the home mom reside in majority in its fair limits. Night life reaches its peak point at 8 o'clock culminating in a steamy starbucks lounge. On occasion, the less braindead of its inhabitants will wonder just why such a pointless town is in existence, although it is quite awesome for the more hard-core partiers who can max out at eat 'n park.
