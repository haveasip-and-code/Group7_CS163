Slave
[slave][drinks][chess][books][talking][hang out][fun] ; Slave is a hidden sanctuary and if you dont believe so ...then you suck at life. if u think that Slave to the Grind is not for you.. then thats great beacuse that means you have no personality, and you probably lack a form of higher education, and that means it would suck to be you. The people that 'chill' at slave are like a family and get incredibly pissed off if someone new is planning on moving in and complaining about it 24/7 ... so i will inform you (whom ever wrote the last deffinition) if you do not like slave... dont go there.
