cape girls
We're the girls that live life to its fullest, and being at the beach all the time is just a bonus. We don't think we're better than you, we just know how to have more fun. We're not afraid to go beer for beer (or shot for shot) with anyone (not even the tough guys). Our life is, and always will be, your vacation. You can find us at bonfires, at beach parties, or just cruising the Cape in our Wranglers. We don't need to compare our tans, because we know ours are better. We don't need to bleach our hair, because the sun does it for us (besides... brunettes do it better). We don't need to workout, because playing football on the beach with the guys is enough. ; And we don't have to take shit from girls around the world, because we get it that you're just jealous.
