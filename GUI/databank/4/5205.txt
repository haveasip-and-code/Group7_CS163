Suck it
'Suck it' was a fad during the 90's used by many children in elementary and middle school. This often went along with a motion; crossing one's arms at the wrists, and hitting the crotch area while they lean back. Though it may be coming back, if one were to ask a group full of children what the motion meant, it is probable that only one may know the answer. ; When it became beknownst to the teachers back in the 90's, anyone seen in the act of such a motion would be prosecuted and/or severly punished (e.g. detention, whippings, time in the corner).
