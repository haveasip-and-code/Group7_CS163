Blair
A wonderful girl who has turned your whole life alround, a girl who has trouble seeing how mutch love you have for her. A girl who, described what attacts you to her, its 'somthing-you-cant-quite-describe'. All of your friends tell you 'you can do better', but you still know love, in a strange way, is still there.
