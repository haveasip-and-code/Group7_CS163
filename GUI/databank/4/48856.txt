dodds
From 'Mark Dodds' (1979-)schoolboy capable of spontaneous and passionate outbursts of very [CAMP] negativity. Has since become the hallmark of disapproval toward any subject and is heavily associated with the glottal enunciation of the 'Eunnghh' sound. CF: Chorus of Snow Patrol's 'Spitting Games'. Only slighlty less glamorous.
