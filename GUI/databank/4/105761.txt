hasher
A member of the worldwide 'Drinking club with a running problem', the Hash House Harriers. A hasher is either a Hare or a Hound in a running event where the runner designated as the 'Hare' lays trail (usually with flour) and the 'Hounds' (the other runners) follow the trail. Once you have run in the hash for a period of time, all hashers are dubbed with a 'hash name', or nickname.
