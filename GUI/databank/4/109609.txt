Seanbil
A 'rugged' marsupial tamed in the 1980's for domestic use and is about the size of a guinea pig. The Seanbil is a rarity among marsupials in that it is diurnal. Seanbil's adhere to a strictly vegan diet and stand up for fellow animal rights. Seanbils especially love to be petted behind the ears and like to wear specially fitted clothing, preferrably in the Roman style. Buy a Seanbil today for happy children.
