pimp my ride
A weekly lesson in the economics of the negro. That somehow it makes more sense to take a 1973 Chevy Luv pickup that's held together with duct tape and bailing wire and, instead of fire-bombing the piece of shit and collecting the insurance money, you spend about $85,000 painting, buying new wheels & tires, & putting a body kit on the outside. But you don't stop there - you put 14 plasma screens, a fish tank, DJ turntable, a stove, washing machine, barber chair, massage table, popcorn popper, dance floor, and putting green inside it. In some strange way, this is the best way to use the cash, and just buying another, newer car is not.
