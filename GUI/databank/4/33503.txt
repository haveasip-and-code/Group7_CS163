Glorious
In the days of 2004, there lived a unique stoner. A stoner who was extremely talented in the ways of comedy. He had an original comedic style that no one can ever come close to. This young stoner had a head full of crazy and hilarious things that he would say and a favorite of everyone was 'glorious'. He would say this in an inimitable voice along with certain matchless hand movements. Dank Master T would say 'glorious' when speaking of something truly wonderful, like the sweet sweet gange.
