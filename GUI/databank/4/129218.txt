frunky
Obviously the crossing of the two words funky and rank therefore becoming the word frunky meaning the wearing of potatoes used as an button on pants such as jeans and average slacks and which was once a very fashionable accessory in the 90s. I for one remember myself wearing them with my fluro parachute pants.
