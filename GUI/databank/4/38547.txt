legolas
Elf from J.R.R. Tolkien's [Lord of the Rings] trilogy. ; Played by Orlando Bloom in the films. Attracts legions of screaming fangirls that could quite easily attach themselves to any given part of his body and never let go. ; The character himself is mediocre at best, exhibiting extraordinary prowess with the bow and arrow but little to no intellect when it comes to dialogue. ; In the novels he bursts into song frequently. In the films he provides 'witty' comic relief along with dwarf-friend [Gimli]. Their tired banter makes the audience yawn, but keeps the fangirls happy. ; See also: [eye candy]
