Kennett
A small town, the mushroom capital of the world, which has seen better days. Its town square has 'character' from its apparently rich history, but its pretty boring for anyone living there now. Its high school calls itself diverse, but its really two segregated groups: the average american kids and the Mexicans. All of kennett is generalized as working at mushroom farms and not knowing english, yet about half of the kids that go there can't relate whatsoever with that type of background. Perhaps some of the Mexicans at kennett are lazy, dirty, slutty (the usual generalization), but many of them are working hard and came here legally. The combination of all of the different backgrounds at KHS make it into a unique place, since not everyone is the same like our stuck-up rival Unionville.
