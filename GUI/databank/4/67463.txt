stepball
A Ball game played against steps, preferably made of concrete and about 4-5 steps high. There are normally 2 players, an outfielder and a batter. The batter would through a tennis ball directly at the step and it would then bounce from the steps and fly in the air. The outfielder would attempt to catch the ball to cause an 'out'. The rules are similar to baseball, except there is no need to run around bases. The base count was determined by the distance the ball traveled and hit the ground after it was thrown into the steps.
