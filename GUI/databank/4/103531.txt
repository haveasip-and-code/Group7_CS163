squeenix
In April of 2003, two large figureheads in gaming, [Squaresoft] and [Enix], merged to make [Square Enix]. ; Instead of wearing yourself out with that useless and silly extra syllable, you can slam the words together at a high speed in order to condense them into the word \'Squeenix\', and by my extensive testing, people will know what you\'re talking about, unless they have no idea who you are, or don\'t play video games.
