A World of Warcraft guild. The guild leader plays Yu-Gi-Oh(or You-Gay-Hoe, what it actually means, it's a card game for closet homos) and decided to name his guild after a card he got because the name was sooo kewl dewd! They pretend their name has nothin to do with it because we make fun of them, and they cry at night. They also zerg like noobs.
