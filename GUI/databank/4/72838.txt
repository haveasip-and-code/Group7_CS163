JDM pose
JDM Pose: Popularized by drivers in Japanese car tuning magazines, this type of pose is typically random, silly (though sometimes serious), and awkward. The poseur attempts to contort one's body in the attempt to create a new pose. However, the outcome is typically the same, i.e. forming an 'M' on one's head by pointing elbows to the sky while touching the top center of the cranium. Those with advanced techniques have the ability to create unappealing facial mannerisms while simultaneously contorting the legs. More advanced configurations can be performed while lying on the ground or can be attempted with props such as mannequins, other humans, or stuffed animals.
