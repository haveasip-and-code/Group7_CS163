Transy
Short for Transylvania. A small, liberal arts college in Lexington, Kentucky where poor people from Kentucky who think they're smart go. Pretty much the crappiest school you can go to and mostly everyone transfers to another school after their first year. Rivals with [Centre] College, another school in Kentucky.
