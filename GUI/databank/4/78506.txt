This is often true, the [bartholin gland] which produces vaginal lubrication is dependent on gentle stimulation, and double fisting can send this tiny gland into spasm. ; Double fisting can be enjoyed by women of any age and recent polls suggest that Scandanavian women in their 50's who have had one or more children particularly enjoy the sensation of being double fisted.
