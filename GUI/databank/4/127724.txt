Sunfire
Piece of crap car made by General Motors to attract college students with little or no money (or mom and dad's money) and also 20 year old moms and dads (also with little to no money) looking to start a family. They decide buy a cheap car that is made with cheap parts and breaks down on a regular basis thinking that they will be saving money, but after insurance and repair bills they will be spending more money than if they bought a solid, well manufactured, car. Any car that retails new for $12,000 CAN is obviously an example of poor quality manufacturing.
