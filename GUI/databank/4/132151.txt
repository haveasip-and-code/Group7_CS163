Baltimore County (B-more)
Baltimore County is one of the biggest countys in Maryland, and with that said that means there are alot of people there. It is very populated and you just can't catagorize the people there. There are the many private (some catholic) schools, where the girls/boys are told, taught, and raised to do one thing, and i'll be damned if they actually did. Most people think our Public School System is bad, but really the Private ones are worse. We have the areas like Catonsville where most of the kids dress, act and wish they were from howard county (just a mile away) but they arent because there parents cant afford it. Catonsville is where you have the punks and preps, but if ur not black you really dont try to be. Then theres Arbutus. <<Enough Said>> In Arbutus we have an overpopulation on wannabe-thug gangster white kids, but really they just try to hard. Its not exactly lower class, but the people there do a damn good job of making it look like it. In the surrounding areas its the same scene, Halethorpe, Relay and Lansdowne is just Arbutus times 10. If your not a wannabe-thug gangster with a 9mm or a 45 I recommend you not wonder down into what they call RiverView and the Highland Villiage. It might be the County ladies and gentleman but the folks living in this area did a damn good job of bringing the lower class population of the city across the line. There is much more of Baltimore County that I didnt mention, feel free to add!
