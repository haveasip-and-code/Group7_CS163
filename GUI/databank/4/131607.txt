in bloom
Possibly the best song by possibly the best band, Nirvana. Is insulted by haters who grew up listening to Simple Plan/Gwen Stefani era music, which comes out of a box and have no real emotional value, as apposed to actual instruments and real feelings. ; A song that reminds you what the world might of been like if Cobain hadn't shot himself.
