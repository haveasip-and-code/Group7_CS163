the specials
The Specials were one of the bands that defined two-tone ska music. They reached their peak in the late 70's/early 80's. Later in the 80's when they began to go downhill, three of the members left to launch their own band. The remaining members, including Jerry Dammer, went on to try and continue their career, but they weren't very successful. Some of their songs include Little Bitch and Too Much Too Young.
