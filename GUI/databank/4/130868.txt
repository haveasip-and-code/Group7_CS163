honeycrack
A form of marijuana. Butane is passed over marijuana, disolving the THC until it settles to the bottom and hardens into yellowish crystals, known as honeycrack. Since the crystals are almost pure THC, it is many times more potent then regular marijuana. Smoking 0.1 grams is enough to get you as blitzed as say, smoking a 3 1/2 gram blunt to your face.
