Wauconda
A little town in northern Illinois that currently holds the Guinness record for the world's largest snowball fight. If anybody looks up this word, they'd say 'Whoa where's dat?' and they would go up to a map and they couldnt find us. ; Bottom Line~ Nobody knows about this town, and nobody cares about it either
