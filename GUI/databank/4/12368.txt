Fox
Although the popular channel has given us The Simpsons, Malcom in the Middle and King of the Hill, it is most definitly, the channel with the most cancled shows. Prehaps what is more disturbing is that most shows cursed to be on Fox are cancled after 3 episodes, then brought back again, and cancled after 2 more episodes. Basicly its a wonder that a few shows survived.
