Canterbury
An elite school of the arts. Many teenagers are locally sent there, but there is an insane competition to transfer there to join their arts program. They accept few people, when hundreds apply. A beautiful but dying old school that sounds better than it is. ; Several internationally famous Canadian singers have attended Canterbury, including Alannis Morisette.
