riverdale
one of the three hill schools, the other two being [fieldston] and [horace mann]. riverdale is by far the best of all three schools. whereas at fieldston they get high, at riverdale the kids get drunk. academics are comprable to horace mann, and better than fieldston. riverdale kicks major ass.
