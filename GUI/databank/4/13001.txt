motocross
One of if not the most addicting sports in the world..... I raced for 1 year and 4 years later I became the U.S. First place triple crown champion in supercross, i was won and became the fastest rider in the United States. But you have to know when to quit. I broke 16 bones and have had 18 concusions. You start to lose your sence after the 5th one thats why i didn't stop.
