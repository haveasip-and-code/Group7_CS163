Timonium
Timonium is a place bombarded with private schools and public schools(that may as well be private). If ya wanna go out to eat, head to Padonia Station cuz they serve the best wings around! Panera or McDonalds are the perfect meeting spots before the big parties. And no, these are not any ordinary parties...gigantic homes are packed with kids from [Loyola], [St.Pauls], [Maryvale], [NDP], and [Dulaney]. No, we don't go for the cheap beer, we drink coctails and Corona. Collars popped are a must and Lacrosse games are a major attraction. If ya gotta work, SnOasis or Jay's Shaved ice are the places to go. Hott girls and Hott guys can be found while you're cruising up and down York Road in your lifted red jeep, beamer, or land rover.
