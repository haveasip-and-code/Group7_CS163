first time
One's [automatic] [thought] is one's [initial] sexual [adventure]. That [thought] is [fair enough] but there is a first time for [everything]. The [first] [day] you went to [school], the [first time] you swam on your own or the [first time] you walked on your [own]. There are so [many] [first] [times] it is [almost] [impossible] to [recall] every one.
