Ho Chi Minh it over
A reference to the [Ho Chi Minh] trail. The Ho Chi Minh Trail was a complex web of different jungle paths that enabled communist troops to travel from North Vietnam to areas close to Saigon. Used when you want someone to bring something over to you, especially if it takes them some effort to do so.
