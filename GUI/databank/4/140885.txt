Bees
Plural of 'bee'. An insect that collects pollen from flowers, makes hives and is well-known for having a 'stinger' that injects an assailant with venom. If you remain calm and stay out of their way they won't be likely to hurt you. However if you attract their attention run like a bat out of hell and jump in some water.
