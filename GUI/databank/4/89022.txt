GreenLanturn
Newgrounds official 'Token Black Guy.' He is invited to all the parties and has a way with the women. Most people correct him about the spelling of his name, but he knows the correct spelling. He is one of the newest Green Lanterns and does not yet have a comic about him or has even made his presence known to the entire world. He is still considered a rookie, but hero in the making. He is one to the nicest guys you'll ever meet.
