mooncake
A Chinese pastry made to celebrate the Harvest Moon Festival, which is always on the 15th day of the 8th month on the lunar calendar. Mooncakes come in many different varieties, the most popular being the ones with Lotus Seed filling. Mooncake is often given as a present from family to family. It is only made once a year. During the Yuan Dynasty, many Chinese rebels often used mooncakes to conceal notes and secret plans from their Mongolian oppressors, seeing as how the Mongolians didn't eat them.
