conga
A term used in reference to a joke revolving around two travelers that enter a forbidden realm in Africa. The price for entering the forbidden realm is CONGA, an alternative to death by the african natives. ; The first traveler, not knowing what CONGA is, finds himself choosing CONGA instead of death. A group of men then promptly put him on a table and rape his body in every orifice (see 'HOLE'). Hard. ; The second traveler, seeing this atrocity, decides he would rather die than be submitted to CONGA. ; 'VERY WELL,' Says the African Warlord. 'YOU HAVE CHOSEN DEATH... By CONGA!!!' ; And so is the joke. CONGA is a word often repeated by those entranced by it's powerful meaning.
