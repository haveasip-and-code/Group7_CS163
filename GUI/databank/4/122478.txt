Devil's Night
October 30. A Detroit-area 'tradition' originally centered around pranks like egging windows and cars, destroying property, or TP'ing houses; in the mid 1970s these relatively harmless but annoying acts were mostly replaced by widespread arson, peaking in the 1980s when up to 800 fires would be reported in a single night. More recently, the city has organized a so-called 'Angel's Night,' where volunteers patrol neighborhoods to prevent and report crimes. The effort has been somewhat effective, and is taken so seriously that news stations almost never use the original term anymore, in an attempt to show support for the volunteers.
