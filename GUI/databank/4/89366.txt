Peyton Manning Syndrome
1. Being very overated, having a great wideout and running back on your team, throwing while up by 40 points, and most importantly: losing games when it counts in the playoffs. ; 2. Being dominated by the New England Patriots in a malfeasant way. ; 3. When you can't win a big game, and at the same time your father is the all time losingest QB in NFL history, and your little brother looks like he is 12 and he crys when drafted until he goes to the team he wants.
