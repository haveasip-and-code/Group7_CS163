bushup
(noun) Extreme degree of screwup or [fuckup] or [snafu], often linked to fatalities, disease, destruction and no way out. Derived from President George W. Bush, the ultimate source right now of bushups, but he does have relatives and staff and fellow Republicans, and God is not always kind, so the term is not going away.
