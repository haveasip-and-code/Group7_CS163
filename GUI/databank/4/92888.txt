Fieldy
The bassist for the band [Korn]. Despite what most of the definitions on this site say, he's not that talented of a bassist. Just look up the Korn bass tabs online and you'll notice they're pretty basic. His style of playing involves down tuning the strings 2 or 3 half-steps and doing mediocre slapping and overly-hard finger picking to get the 'rattling sound.' Plus, he's got so many effects running through that if he just turned them all off his sound would sound similar to a dieing squirrel being hit with a crowbar.
