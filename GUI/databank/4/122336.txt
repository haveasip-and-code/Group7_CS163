Basque
its a region in spain. just like glacians, castilians, and catalans, they dun like the spanish government. it is also a very unique langauge. it is unique because there are no roots of the language to neother language in the world. not even ancient greek or latin. some say that it was the decent of the langauge of cavemen.
