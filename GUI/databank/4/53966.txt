urban suctionary
Sarcastic slang for the Urban Dictionary, an online dictionary proporting to offer definitions of urban language, which dictionary is hardly a reliable resource considering it derives it's words and definitions from any Tom, Dick, or Harry that wants to slosh the net with their illiterate ramblings of nonsensical stupidity.
