Manties
Panties made for a Man ('MAN'ties). ; Descernable from the ubiquitious tighty whities in; ONE- rarely found in white, other colours dominating (eg. Blue, yellow, orange); Two- Lacking in the upside down 'Y' slot used for peeing without removal of the garment (though for the life of me I cannot understand why someone would bend it that way); Three- 'scrunchy-like' waist and leg bands, not exterior elastic bands.
