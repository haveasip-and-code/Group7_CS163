dogs are barking
Translation: 'My feet are tired.' ; I'm uncertain of its origin. I started hearing this phrase around 2002 or so from different people, then it was used by one of the soldiers in 'Half Life: Opposing Force' ; I originally took this to mean 'I gotta take a DUMP!' But have been proven wrong , apparently. Nonetheless I still prefer my interpretation.
