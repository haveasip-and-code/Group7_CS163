Tribes Vengeance
A game where one guy gets in light armor class with an 'energy' pack and completely ; dominates the entire game. A game where you get 300 points for capturing a flag, but 0 points for piloting successful consecutive bombing missions for 7 minutes straight without crashing once. A game where only few servers are populated and those servers have lazy moderators who would never DARE to rase the time limit above the measly 20 minute default OR create an ORIGINAL map cycle to ensure that players do not have to slave over sucky maps.
