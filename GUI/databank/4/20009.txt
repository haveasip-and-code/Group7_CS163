cottonmouth
I've been smoking for 35+ years, and I have to say all the definitions I've seen here are wrong. Cottonmouth refers to when you're caching a bowl and a flamethrower shoots through the bowl, singeing the back of your mouth or your throat. The super-hot ashen bit has attached to the inside of your mouth and that's how you get 'caught-in-mouth.'
