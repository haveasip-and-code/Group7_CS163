dalton
A rich, corrupt private school on the upper east side of Manhattan. Basically, hell on earth. School is run by trophy wives who always have to make sure their kids don't get put in the same homeroom as 'the unpopular ones.' A typical grade includes one minority, and a few hundred naive and sheltered boys and girls who act 'hood despite never daring to take a step towards Harlem. While rumored to be impossible to enter, as long as you have money, entry is no obstacle.
