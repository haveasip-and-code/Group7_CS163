fanbrat
A fanbrat is an immature, childish person in [fandoms]; usually around fourteen or thirteen years old and largely female, the fanbrat bashes characters from [anime], books or cartoons heavily. ; They also seem to have loads of hatred for female characters for their personality traits, despite the fact that a male character has the same traits. They seem to forgive 'bishies' and provide no reason why they should forgive the male while they bash the female. ; The fanbrats' activity can be disturbing sometimes: they threaten the character's life, they threaten a fan of the character, they refuse to listen to reason and they seem to think they can do whatever they want. ; A common insult among them is 'slut', despite the fact that they have no proof that charcter they are bashing is sexually promiscuous in any way. ; Despite the fact that these characters do not exist, the fanbrat lies about their personality as justification for hating them (see the [Kagome] definition).
