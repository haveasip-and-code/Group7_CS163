Anakin
1) A character in the Star Wars Trilogie. Is the supreme evil guy who turns into a more evil guy when he puts his dark helmet on. ; 2) A webmaster of a dutch forum. Sometimes strict but also justified, is the bodyguard of PrincessVegeta. They say his banning is faster then his shadow. But sometimes he's even too nice for SOME people.
