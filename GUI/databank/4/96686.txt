Bose
An acronym for a company which uses unreliable and substandard materials to create a stereo which disintegrates after short sustained use (about 3.2 seconds) at about 50 dB, then packages it in a pretty casing and surrounds it with marketing which is comparable to the Nixon '68 campaign in which he claimed he had 'secret' solutions to our problems, so also does this company claim to have 'secret' technology through planetary domination.
