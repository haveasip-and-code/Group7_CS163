asian kung-fu generation
One of the best (in my opinion) J-Rock bands out there. Known as 'Ajikan' in Japan, becuase it's easier to say than Asian Kung-Fu Generation, and it kind of sounds like it. ; Their music is greatly influeced by American bands like [Weezer], and it really shines through in most their songs. Japanese Weezer... hahahaha.... ; Most Americans found this band through Naruto, or FMA with their songs 'Haruka Kanata (Far, Far Away)' and 'Rewrite', respectively.
