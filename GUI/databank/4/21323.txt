West Virginia University
noun: The place where before football games a cop hands you a cup for beer, and says 'Enjoy the game', where it is becoming acceptable to burn couches and drink with professors. The place where everyone is 21 no matter what your REAL ID says. Occassionally attend class, and when you do you are still [hungover] or [drunk]. Sadly where you have to depend on a crappy transportation system, the PRT which is guarnteed to make you late for class. And no matter where you go its uphill BOTH ways.
