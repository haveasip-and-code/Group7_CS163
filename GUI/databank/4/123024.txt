Scott Walker
1. A Famous blues guitarist and founder of the Walker Brothers Band. ; 2. An orthopaedic doctor in the Fort Wayne Hospital, Fort Wayne Indiana. ; 3.A kinda hot guy I dated once. He was really nice. He made me feel good, but a few of my friends didn't like him. We had a bit of a fling, but I broke up with him so I could get my old b/f.
