Scallie
A [scallie] will definatly be from a council estate or a surrounding area. Traditionally they could be found outside their local off licence or chip shop. However they have now infested the earth as they have realeased that there life outside there holes. At times while walking the street all I can see is a sea of Burbury/Adidas/Nike and any other make of clothing that most people would only wear to the gym or not at all. They all smoke L&B and turn what ever the local dialect is into an incomprehendable noise. If you ever have the unfortunate experience of interacting with these inderviduals you will soon realise that they all talk complete shit. There shit usually involves an initial ice breaker of asking fo a fag, if this does not immediately happen it will in the following minutes then fighting, drinking or complete lies about how there distant family members own expensive sports cars or exotic homes will follow.WANKERS!!!
