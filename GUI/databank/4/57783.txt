Loudoun County
A county in Northern Virginia that is half an extension of Fairfax, half cowfield. Those in the West hate the East, we consider any neighborhood where the houses don't cost at least 500 grand 'the Ghetto', and is also the main supporter of [Abercrombie] and Fitch in all of the U.S. Also known as The L.C. to many of it's residents.
