burnout
1. Anything a muscle car can do and a ricer can not. (i.e. climbing a hill steeper than a 15 degree incline.) ; 2. Slamming the gas pedal to the floor when not in motion, causing the tires to spin without traction, making smoke. This is something that mainly only Muscle Cars can do, caused by the mass amount of torque put out by the big cubes of muscle car engines. ; 3. Someone who wears Def Leppard wife beaters and smokes cigs while driving in his Camaro, listening to AC/DC.
