Olya
An akward fruit of a person, with many uses and properties. Namely the ability to be of 2 seperate and opposite minds about something at entirely the same time. Often used as a base for poorly named skin care products which are prone to ending up as puns in very bad jokes (namely this one). Occasionally misplaced in early Popeye cartoons as O. Oyl.
