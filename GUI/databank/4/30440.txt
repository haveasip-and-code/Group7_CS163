Napolean Dynamite
An indie movie. You either love it or hate it. Quoted constantly by fifth and sixth graders running around with 'VOTE FOR PEDRO' t-shirts. Has absolutely no plot or storyline and the characters are basically [white trash] and really stupid...but it sticks in your mind!!! its sooo stupid that it's kind of funny. anyway, see it because even if you hate it, it's better to have seen it cuz people won't stare at you like ur some idiot. I still don't get why its so popular!!! it makes no sense...but w/e its still okay. on a scale of 1-10, its a 4 imo
