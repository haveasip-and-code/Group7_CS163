Aged Communist Lawyers Union. A group of rat lawyers with law degrees from prestigious east coast private schools. Popular mythology holds that they are ardent defenders of the constitution and bill of rights, but in reality they are nothing more than an extreme left wing organization hell bent on the destruction of the United States. They pursue this goal by eroding the fabric of American society from the inside out via litigation. Through their selective interpretation of the constitution they have found it imperative to defend the constitutional rights of the North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) and illegal enemy combatants detained in Guantanamo Bay while keeping the Boy Scouts of America under judicial assault and never saying a word about the continued erosion of the second amendment.
