Naperville
A city known to have an income range slightly less than Beverly Hills but a hell of a lot greater than most the world. While it has an upper class reputation, and not undeservingly, there is a 'ghetto' within the city limits. The Naperville Ghetto is a series of apartment buildings that, at last count, contains 100% of the black population of the city.
