leet
omfg, j00 411 r 73h n00blets X3pt #3 {t3h Suck it, bitches m4n}. j00 411 s4y 'Oh, it stands for elite.' \ () 5 - `/ 7 !!!!!!111!!1one ; If you can read that, your IQ is above 80, and I congradulate you. that's an example of softcore leet, except the last part, which is hardcore, since it replaces every word with symbols. What 'Suck it, bitches' failed to mention was that its use has indeed fallen out of the hands of those who are leet, and is now widely used by any Tom, Dick, or Harry. Please, don't use leet unless you are t3h pr0g (a programmer) or t3h h4x0r (a hacker). And even then, keep it in your comments in code, not on chat boards. It makes a mess of things....
