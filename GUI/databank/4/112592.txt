Pricker
From the medieval days when a person took a needle and tried to find a witch's mark ( a area of skin that wouldn't bleed) and prove a person was a witch. The pricker was paid for their work and would prick a person hundreds of times to find a witch's mark. modern context would be a person who tries to find anything wrong with someone so they can deliver them to somebody and receive a profit.
