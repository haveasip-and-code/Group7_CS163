hooking up
'Hooking up' is a candy coated way of saying were going to fuck. It has been adopted by today`s preppy pop culture in an effort to 'candy coat', glamorize, and make 'casual fucking' more acceptable. This same preppy pop culture is notorious for abusing the word 'like' and can be found in any Hollister, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, Express, Armani Exchange ect. etc.
