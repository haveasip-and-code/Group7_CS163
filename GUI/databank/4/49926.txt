ricans
1)One third of people that are actually born in puerto rico, so i say those who are, its ok for them to say theyre rican and to rock their flag. ; 2)little american-born kids, who have puerto rican parents, werent born in PR and have never been there, and yet still claim to be puerto rican and try to know whats going down in the 'hood' cause according to them theyre the best race to get along with blacks. ; 3) DAMN SEXY(GUYS)!! ; Conclusion)so i say...not many ricans are actually rican. just about all of them are damn sexy though (guys). but most with messed up wanna-be attitudes. ive found few ricans that are nice and real, but everyone to their own being.
