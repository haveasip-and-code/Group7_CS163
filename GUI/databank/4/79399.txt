paddling
That marvelous activity in which a Woman uses a broad, flat bladed instrument, a paddle (such as for paddle ball, or any similar instrument) to strike the bare behind of a man repeatedly and with much force. ; She will make his arse turn crimson, maybe bruised, and often the discoloration will last several days to a couple of weeks during which time it may turn several colors. ; Very humiliating for the man, yet curiously desirable. Enables a Woman to take continually more control over the man.
