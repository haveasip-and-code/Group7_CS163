Lenny Kravitz
Bi-racial music artist, with a retro funk, reggae sound...son of deceased television actress 'Roxie Roker' {Good Times} and producer/Exec. 'Sy Kravitz'. ; Unable apparently to embrace his heritage, he went by the name of 'Romeo Blue' early in his career...however he found no success in what appeared to be patterning himself in the image of music talent 'Prince'. ; He went on to later marry 'Lisa Bonet' {Liliquoi Moon/Cosby Show}, but after sowing a few too many oats...found himself divorced in 1991. ; They have one child together...a daughter, 'Zoe'. ; His music has a fairly distinct flavor for the times, with a unique mixture of Reggae, Funk, Rock and Blues...and his unique looks and style have also brought him notice. ; To his credits are also several songs written for other artists, such as Madonna's 'Justify My Love'. ; He has a mystique and sensuality about him that makes him desirable to women of various races...and to many, his flagrant non-conformist traits {such as tattoos and several piercings} are beyond the realm of mere sexiness.
