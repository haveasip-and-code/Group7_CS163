bandersnatch
The extrememly dangerous creature from the survival horror game Resident Evil Code Veronica X. Built to be the multi-purpose tyrant, they are equipped with a singular super strong stretchy arm. (hence the 'band' as in bandy in the name bandersnatch) on there right side and have no arm on the left. Get too close they grab your head and crush your skull. Get too far away they will batter you about via stretching their arm. If you hide up/down stairs they will use the arm like a grappling hook to grab hold of an object and pursue. Very slow moving but deadly. Generally in packs of 3 but the occassional singular individual.
