Geiser
Also known as Geiseriasto, a ridiculous slob, who often lives in an apartment showed by a letter following a number. A funny, chubby little boy who often dreams of reaching a high amount of potential. Often found in the Northern USA. Any person to come in reach with this Volumptuious character has therefore given his life to the Geiser. The Geiser will continually call the subject to 'hang out'.
