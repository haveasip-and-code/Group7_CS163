Lakers
One of sports' best and classiest organizations. The Lakers win championships like nobody's business. The team's leader, Kobe Bryant, is simply the league's best player. None of the Lakers fight with fans, wear massive bling or do rags, or speak out in the media and make fools of themselves like most other teams. Actually a humble group of players who deliver for their fans.
