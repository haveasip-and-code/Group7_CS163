Litost [Lee' - toast]
Litost is a nearly untranslatable Czech word, a state of feeling miserable and humiliated. 'Litost is a state of torment created by the sudden sight of one's own misery,' - The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Milan Kundera. Litost connects insult to revenge, with desire to strike back at the perceived source of one's shame.
