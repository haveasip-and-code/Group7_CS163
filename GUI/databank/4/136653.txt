international music feed
A universal music channel that vastly plays popular music from the USA. The interesting part is the global music, the short bits on the artists and condensed culture shows. ; I personally don't care for repetitive popular american music so it's refreshing to listen to music I've not heard before. Life before imf consisted of ignorance to the evident tasteless music of South Africa. Worth checking out for cultural diversity.
