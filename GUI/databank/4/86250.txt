cfl
Canadian football league. An inferior brand of football to the NFL, many call it more exciting and better. But those who do have obviously never watched a single game of NFL OR CFL football and are just dumbass canadians trying to make it out that canada is the greatest country in the world. CFL Sucks, NFL is so much better.
