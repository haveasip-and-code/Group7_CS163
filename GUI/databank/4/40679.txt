peckerwood
A good, but much-maligned, white person. ; Peckerwoods do not hijack airplanes. They don't expect society to take care of them. They never demand socialist medicine. No peckerwood ever prances in a parade wearing a jock strap. ; Peckerwoods mind their own business and are not a burden on society. Be nice to peckerwoods. Take a peckerwood to lunch this week!
