zhumir
national liquor of ecuador, with its competitor 'cristal' trailing behind (same price, but nastier. not the cristal champagne, a cheap knockoff hard liquor). Zhumir is 40% and a dollar a bottle, you can find it at any party you go to. be careful drinking it, it might fuck you up a little if you're not a native. Comes in the seco (dry) and limon varieties...it's all the same shit though. also comes in several sizes.
