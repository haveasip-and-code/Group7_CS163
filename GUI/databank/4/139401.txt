gigabeat
a great mp3/wma/wav player by Toshiba. it beats the shitty iPod by a longshot. it boasts a larger screen, that ROTATES, like PivotPro on PC if you know what that is, it holds higher bitrates for higher quality than just the shitty 128kbps mp3 and mp4 codec iPod uses through the gay iTunes. the software toshiba includes is decent. i recommend it to anyone who hates the click wheel, like me, and for people that desire something sexy and different. amen
