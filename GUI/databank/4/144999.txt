schoolcruft
A worthless [Wikipedia] entry on an uninteresting [school] that has no worthiness of an entry whatsoever. Although it angers those who follow [deletionism], there is a highly organised group of [trolls] who rig [votes for deletion] and intimidate neutrals in order that such crap is kept.
