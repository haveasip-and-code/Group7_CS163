antaeus
A men's cologne made by Chanel, a very sensual-smelling cologne that turns women's heads. Back in 1894, I had just purchased a bottle at Filene's in the Crystal Mall when on walking out of the mall, this cute chick starts telling me how good I smell, etc. Well, one thing leads to another and the next thing I know I'm driving her home. Really great stuff. Thanks to Mark for introducing me to the stuff!
