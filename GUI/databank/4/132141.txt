nintendo ds
(1)The only portable console of this generation (2005) that has the ability to spawn idiot fanboys that use unfounded hatered and stupidity to spout the same cliched arguments to make their retarded point. ; (2)A portable nintendo 64 with two screens and backwards compatability with Gameboy advance games. A decent concept with good execution, if it wasn't for it's one weakness... the annoying nintendo fans that fault sony for trying something new.
