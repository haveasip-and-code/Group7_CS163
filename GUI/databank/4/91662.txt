Catloaf
A Catloaf is a meatloaf made from cat meat. It is a Timorese dish and is considered a delicacy among some food connosieurs. The Catloaf was reportedly invented by Joseph Moillet in 1891. Of course this report was made by a drunk named Jim Beehan, so it was from quite an unscrupulous source. In conclusion, on May 20th, 1993 I had a shower.
