R&B
R&B is a form of music that is closely related to [pop], [rap], and [hip-hop]. R&B is similar to rap except that instead of rapping, there is singing. But there is a beat in the back. Many times will an R&B siinger feature a rapper/hip-hop artist, and vice-versa. R&B can be relaxing, or sometimes it can be party music. It is a very nice form of music.
