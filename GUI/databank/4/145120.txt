Milron
A popular internet term, born from the gathering of idiots in chatrooms. Milron loosely translates but is not limited to: [Moron], [Idiot], [Fool], [Liar], [Fake], [Hypocrite], etc. ; A milron is someone in a chatroom who tries to take on the form of someone else, commonly referred to as a liar, or fake; has horribly below par intelligence, and rock-solid [fundamentalist] beliefs. But it can just mean an idiot.
