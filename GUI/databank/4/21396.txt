Necropolis
Morbid, gothic, chilly tourist attraction. ; Hill on outskirts of Glasgow city, covered in with hundreds of graves - from small unmarked stones to massive mausoleums. A solitary footpath winds round the Necropolis, spiralling round the crest of the hill to the top. Found next to Glasgow Cathedral. ; Creepy as shit at night. Not much better in the day but at least you can see where you're going.
