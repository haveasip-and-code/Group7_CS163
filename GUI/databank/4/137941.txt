Bloomfield Hills
A city in Michigan where drugs, sex, alcohol, and general superficiality are a vital part of reality. Where you can charge a slice of pizza on plastic, go to Somerset on weekends, Old Woodward, Bham, and the Palladium (overcrowded with middle schoolers in the summer), Shops at the Top, a bar on every corner(hookah), sixth graders with cells, and private school rivals (+ the public schools that hate them all). Houses that wrap around an entire street. Where there are more country clubs than banks, and porche driving soccer moms popping their collars, and no one gives a shit about the West Coast (even though a winter home is nice). 16 yr olds get mustangs for their first cars and our addiction is popularity. The girls for the most part are pretty bitchy, but hot. Everyone has a northface at age 5...located in oakland county- THE REAL OC BITCHESS, designer anything is the way to go
