moldy peaches
They're this really fun band from new York that cracks me up. You gotta love the music (especially 'Who's Got the Crack?'). Adam Green has put out a couple solo albums as well as Kimya Dawson. My friend talked to Kimya Dawson online. She's apparently very nice. Plus she sang backup on 'How It Should Be (Sha Sha)', which is this really rad song by [Ben Kweller]. ; The Moldy Peaches make me happy. Especially the songs 'Lucky #9' and 'NYC's Like a Graveyard'.
