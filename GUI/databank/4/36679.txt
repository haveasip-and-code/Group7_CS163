Bav
The largest person to ever exist. Body fat content is over 99.9%. This individual is several stories tall and has explosive farts which can propel him to other planets. Bav's unique skin structure and make-up allows him to absorb any and all materials he comes in contact with. He also has a fat plate, which is an extension of his abdomen region similar to a beer belly, but in this case extending almost to the ground. Case in point of his absorption powers is that when he pees, it is absorbed into his fat plate. His IQ is extremely low, and he tends to take orders from an individual named Yer, who is just a normal human. Bav thinks he is friends with all, but is rather clumsy and causes many accidents and even catastrophes with his extreme bulk.
