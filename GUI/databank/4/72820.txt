Sagat
A very strong, even cheap, character from several Street Fighter games and Capcom vs SNK2. Sagat's seriously high priority pokes and massive damage is balanced only by his massiveness (which only seems to really hurt him in SFA). Most Sagat players rely on cheap tactics, such as spamming his HP (even though Balrog's HP can beat it in CVS2) or his Tiger Shots. This doesn't become a problem with better players since any resonably good player can defeat a cheap player.
