Tekken Five
One of the best Tekkens to hit the PS2. The video graphics looked almost real!!! You could customize your character, you can earn a whole lotta money, the difficulty ain't too bad either. The difficulty is challenging but I like it. It is funny. The characters interact with one another in a select few fights. The only things that I really didn't like was the narration. It would go in the greatest graphics slot of the tekken list which was tekken tag, tekken 3, and tekken five.
