valley girl
me. cute, blonde, wears abercrombie and hollister and forever 21. we say like, and oh my gosh (true valley girls do NOT say oh my god...no way) all guys love valley girls because they THINK we are oblivious, and easy but we arent. valley girls are usually blonde and cute and they usually hate the valley and hate being called a valley girl even tough i am one hehe
