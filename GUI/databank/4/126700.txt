synthetic drugs
Term that refers to non-organic, chemically synthesized, unsafe recreational drugs such as [ecstasy] (MDMA), [LSD], [meth] (methamphetamine), [Rohypnol], [PCP], and [OxyContin]. Often yield unreliable results, cause seizures and comas, reduce or remove inhibitions from the user, and come in forms that make it difficult for the user to determine if the drug is pure or tainted (further increasing the risk). Usually these drugs have mild to serious hallucinogenic and psychotic/nervous system effects, heavy health risks, and are extremely easy to overdose. ; Often referred to as 'club drugs,' 'designer drugs,' or 'rave drugs' due to their popularity among ravers and clubbers.
