AIM slut
A person (either gender fits, actually...) who talks to multiple people, at the same time. This can get very annoying, as this person is usually [cybering] with other people, and then ignoring their true [friends] who then decide that they've had enough of waiting twenty minutes for a reply of 'yeah' or 'ok' or 'yep' or 'lol'.
