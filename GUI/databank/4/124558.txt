Earthworm
A member of the Swarthmore male [ultimate frisbee] team. Possesses much love of the game, reasonable quanities of alcohol, and an uncanny competitive edge. Sometimes misses practice because he is writing a five-page paper that was due last week but his professor is really quite serious about it being due in twenty minutes.
