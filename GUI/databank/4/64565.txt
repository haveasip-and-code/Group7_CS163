Good Charlotte Fan
There are quite a few kinds of Goood Charlotte fans. ; 1- Pre teens who think that Benji and Joel (the band's front men) are 'OmG So0o0o0 hawT' ; 2- Kids who at first liked them because it was the fad but now hate them because it's the new fad. See [Good Charlotte haters] ; 3- People that at onje time liked there music but were sorely dissapointed in there new album but still find it fun to hang out online laughing at new pictures of Goood Charlotte or reminising about the old days. While to some they come out as haters they really love the band deep down but just find them the perfect thing to poke fun at, ; 4- The people who actually like Good Charlotte's music.
