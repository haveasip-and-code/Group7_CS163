dwane-bag
The term Dwane-bag(shortened to [D-bag], but this is commonly recognized as douche bag) came from an offhand threat made one night while waiting for concert tickets. With its origins coming from the act of [tea bagging]. The process of Dwane-bagging involves waiting for a sleeping person to open their mouth, the Dwane-bagger the puts his/its(in case the act is performed by a gender confused individual) balls in the person's mouth, essentially having them lick the balls, and then proceeds to defecate on the Dwane-baggee's face/eyes. While the act of Dwane-bagging could be done by a female but as there are: 1. No Balls and 2. This is probably already a form of Japanese scat play. The effect of the shaming is lost. Also see the reverse Dwane-bag, a process involving a normal [tea bagging] and the act of defecating in the mouth.
