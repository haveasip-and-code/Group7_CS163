Morning Deuce Syndrome
Refers to the chronic inability to remain asleep in the early hours of the day due to awakening urges to deficate. Studies have shown that patients diagnoised with Morning Deuce Syndrome (MDS) suffer from loss of sleep and deficate on an irregular basis. The [morning deuce] often effects mental well being (depression) and can cause lack of energy throughout the rest of the day.
