Sacco
Slang term used to describe a male (often teenager), who is in denial of his love for women's clothing and jewellery. Openly will they deny their passion, but secretly will they love to dress up in girls clothes. Wearing lingerie or necklaces, or modifying their male clothes to look girlish are tell-tales signs of a Sacco.
