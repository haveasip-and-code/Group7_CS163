Rosemead High School
A shitty school in a shitty neighborhood infested by fobs & Mexicans. The teachers are bad, the education is bad and those who go on to prestigious universities fail because they are overshadowed by other intelligent students who come from good schools. ; The cafeteria food is horrendous. Breakfast consists of leftovers from June of 1985. Lunch is just as bad. Empty pizza boxes with Dominoes logo are used as decoys to hide the the school's shitty cooking. ; The student body is very diverse. Here you will find all types of styles ranging from emo to punk, and from prep to posers. The school is split on gender but some students are sexually questionable. ; The school is financially depleted. Once we could not even afford copy paper. The restrooms are closed during school hours because we cannot afford to fix the plumbing. Some classrooms have broken light fixtures that haven't been repaired since the Nixon administration. Noticeable cracks from the Northridge quake of '94 are still visible around campus. Luckily during 2005, they have found money to remodel the lavatories and parts of the football field. ; Most of the students here are book smart but they have no street smarts. For example, girls spend all their money at well known clothing retailers instead of saving or investing their money in bonds or IRA's. Guys are manipulated by their girlfriends (who they shouldn't even be dealing with at such a young age) to buy presents for them. ; Overall this is not a very good school. Even if you attained a 4.5 GPA it is nothing compared to those who come from prominent high schools from around the U.S. The reason why you were accepted into a UC was because the admissions officers had sympathy for you. ; If you can, do yourself a favor and transfer to another school.
