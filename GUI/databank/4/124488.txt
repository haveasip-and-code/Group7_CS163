Police Box
Police boxes started to appear in 1880. 'Modern' police boxes, like the one in [Doctor Who] started to appear in 1920. A police box was a telephone for the use of members of the police. Police boxes were before two-way radios. ; Police boxes have a telephone that is linked directly to the local police station, allowing officers to keep in contact with the station, reporting anything unusual, requesting help, or to detain prisoners until a vehicle could be sent. This was a time when the officers walked or rode bicycles rather than use a car. ; There is light on the top of the box, which would flash to alert an officer that he should contact the station. ; Members of the public could also use the phone, which was on the outside of the box, to call for help.
