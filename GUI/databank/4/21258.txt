Dreamcast Finger
A medical condition first coined with overuse of the [SEGA Dreamcast] but has now re-occurred due to the Microsoft X-Box. The dual trigger controller design means that after extended play of racing games, the right hand index finger can ache and become numb. ; Also see: [Playstation Thumb]
