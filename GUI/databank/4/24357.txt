great falls
great falls is the 22066 zip code, the most expensive to live in in virginia and one of the most expensive in the united states. people here shop at tysons II, etc. (gucci, prada, louis vuitton, lacoste, hermes) regularly. not the most friendly people but if you're curt enough you'll fit right in. ; lots of weed smoking and drinking but it is well afforded. what else is there to do in great falls?
