Richmond
A city in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Some sections are gentrified, but largely a wasteland of pollution, lawlessness, and insolvency. Lots of barbed wire fences, junked cars, broken glass, and smokestacks. Not to be confused with THE Richmond, a neighborhood in San Francisco itself just north of Golden Gate Park. The Richmond (In SF) is a clean and pleasant residential neighborhood with some good restauraunts. Richmond (In Contra Costa County), is a former shipbuilding boomtown turned Godforsaken Ghetto slum.
