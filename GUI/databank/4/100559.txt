rap snacks
The self-styled 'Official snack of hip-hop', Rap Snacks are James 'Fly' Lindsay's brainchild. Rap Snacks come in six flavours: Sour cream and onion, sour cream and ultra cheddar, hot riplets, platinum bar-be-que, honey BBQ, and 'southern crunk BBQ'. All snacks feature a rapper on the front, and information about said rap artist on the back. Rappers featured on Rap Snacks range from Dirt McGirt to Master P. Lindsay wishes to impart the message to all urban youth that change is possible, and that reading, staying out of gangs, and starting your own business are invaluable. Commonly found at 7-11 stores and the like, Rap Snacks are independently owned alternatives to Doritos with more 'cred' than those honky chips will ever have.
