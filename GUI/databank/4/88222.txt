FC United
Splinter club formed by Manchester United supporters following American tycoon Malcolm Glazer's takeover of the fabled club. Many MUFC supporters view FC United as abandoning the magnificent tradition of Manchester United FC, while others view it as a grass-roots movement to set up a truly non-commercial team owned and operated by the fans.
