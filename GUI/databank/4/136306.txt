port-a-loo
a toilet on wheels. a little room in which to do a 1, 2 OR 3. unloading your bowels or emptying your bladder on a bog with one-ply toilet paper. painfull and smelly. and sorry for you if its runny. EISH WENA(see 'EISH WENA'). ; no worries about flushing! no one else does it! infact, many of them have had the flushing handle stolen. but some are a little more sofisticated... they have a BUTTON!
