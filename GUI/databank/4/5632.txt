buned
A typo made by a particular dumbass commonly known as Dura. He made it during an intense argument in which Billy retorted to the user Che with 'Hello' and utterly destroyed him. He obviously meant to type 'Burned'. He even highlighted the fucking work in pink and bolded it. ; It is used commonly on irc.rivalirc.net:#bling , because Dura originally fucked up the english language by mispelling burned.
