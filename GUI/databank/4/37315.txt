hancock park
Extremely wealthy area of Los Angeles run by a bunch of Free City clad, rambunctious teenagers who know how to party. Larchmont is the heart of Hancock Park, otherwise known as the HP. At night, Larchmont is filled with 11 year old skateboarders in front of blockbuster and druggie teenagers with cold hard cash burning a hole in their pockets at Pickett Fences, LF, and Spirituali. See [coolest hood ever] bitches.
