Drum Major
Self-proclaimed god of band. Usually is described as the director's [bitch], a small price to pay to make everyone else his or her bitch. Wields incredible power during the fall, but loses it during spring, where the band is undergoing what is known as 'concert season'. Is particularly fond of newbies and works to take them under wing quickly
