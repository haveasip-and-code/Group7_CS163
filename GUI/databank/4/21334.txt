Jock
jocks are funny because they will mock a geek or anybody who doesn't participate in [P.E.], but then get their ass kicked first by the geek's verbal reaction which will usually insult their sexuality or imply their lack of a brain, and then secondly get their ass kicked by the hardcore metalist geeks. ; a jock wears weird brand clothes even if they don't have anything to do with it... i skateboard and i don't wear element and adio clothes everywhere i go, jocks are poseurs that can't do anything worthwhile like going to LAN parties, and instead they play football and pat eachother on the ass whilst claiming they aren't homosexual.
