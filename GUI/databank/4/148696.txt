Judge Judy
Judge Judy is none other than a yankee doodle judge who has the cases that are brought before her in court televised. One can only assume that these 'cases' are fake, because they're all quite stupid like 'Mr Gonzales threw a stone in my yard. I feel extremely threatened and like I can't even live at my home in the same way. He also deliberately splashes water on my driveway while watering his bluebells. It is plainly eroding the concrete away and I want full compensation for all damage costs. I am so discriminated against.' And then the defendent would make their rebuttle which would be something of the same sort. Judge Judy then would ask her assistant to make the huge walk from the judges desk thing to the plaintiff and defendent's tables to retrieve pointless photos of the 'crime scene', and then interrogate both with pointless questions and hand gestures.
