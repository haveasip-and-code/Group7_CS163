dick dastardly
The fictional character from [Wacky Races] who always loses. He continuously tries to set traps for other racers which do not work. Perhaps stupidly, whenever he gets ahead in a race he attempts to set a trap for the other racers rather than keeping on going and winning outright. Has a dog minion called [Muttley]. Drives the [Mean Machine]
