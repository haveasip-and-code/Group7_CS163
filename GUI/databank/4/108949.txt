Gin in the Brita
Anytime one thing is replaced with another. Originally invented as an April Fool's Day prank. Water can be removed from any container that holds it and replaced with gin, vodka or any other clear spirit. An unsuspecting person will pour a glass and drink it down. Hopefully that person will spit it out all over their large, heaving breasts or at least go to work at a pet store completely shit-faced.
