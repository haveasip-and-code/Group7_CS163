A server-level Internet filtering service used by many public schools, which blocks out adult content, email access, personal webmastering accounts, and anything that is construed to be 'fun.' It's basically 'censorship,' any way you look at it. ; Unfortunately, access to educational materials is blocked, due to technicalities. ; For example, one would be hard-pressed to pull up the text of 'Romeo and Juliet,' because there is a line that says 'Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!' ; Of course, Romeo is referring to the heart, and not the female breast, in this sense; but the filtering program does not understand that.
