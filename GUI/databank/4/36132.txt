Atheism
some argue the state and atheists have cause over 100 million deaths. Nothing compared to the sheer number of deaths that have been cause by religion and theism in the past (crusades) and the simple halt of progress that the church has created (inquisition). Also, violence based on God continues today in the Middle East. But atheists are bad because they don't have faith in something that has no logical merit.
