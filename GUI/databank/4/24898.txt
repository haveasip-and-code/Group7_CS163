Gigolo Hut
Franchise located in suburban malls, usually between Abercrombie and Lane Bryant. Although the product is mainstream (i.e. square-jawed suit-clad businessmen, and, for the younger set, wavy haired, think-they're-cool-as-fuck frat boys),this booty boutique can be an affordable and quick solution for the girl in a sexual or social bind who hasn't the time or money to go couture.
