girls gone wild
Quasi-pornography. A collection of videotaped live Mardi Gras/Spring Break events where female college students expose their breasts for beads/a shirt/indignity/angry parents. Further reinforcing that all women are sex objects and pushing the feminist movement back several steps; consequently losing their footing and falling down the staircase.
