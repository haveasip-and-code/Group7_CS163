Urban Outfitters
A store popular with kids who were picked on in High School and now wrap their identity around expensive T-shirts that have funny little sayings in cute colors. Employees usually listen to [Bright Eyes] and cry when they masturbate. Was founded on hippie ideals of free love and cheap clothing, but now sells Lacoste, Diesel, and jeans with holes and bleach stains that cost hundreds of dollars. Misleads shoppers, making them believe they are special, unique, or funny because of an asymmetrical collar or Led Zepplin logo. Distracts customers with bright colors and decor so they don't realize they are actually paying $150 for a beanbag chair.
