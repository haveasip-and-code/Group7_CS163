terrace
A series of concrete (or in the 'good old days' wooden) steps that are often seen at football grounds with crush barriers at regular intervals that are designed for spectators to stand on. ; They have been phased out of the upper echelons of English football after the Taylor Report, which followed the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death. It didn't specifically say that the fact the spectators were standing was the problem, more that the huge fences that were designed to pen fans in, even if they had to get out in the case of an emergency, were the real culprits. ; It has been scapegoated for tragedies such as the Hillsborough and Heysel disasters when actually poor stadium design and maintenance and inadequate policing was to blame. ; In Germany standing areas have been reintroduced after they were banned in a similar move to the 'all-seater' law in England. However, they have shown that well designed modern terraces have a future.
