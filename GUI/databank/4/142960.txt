primera
A particularly under rated car made by nissan, the 1.6's powered through the front wheels by a GA16DE producing around 100 BHP and the rarer GT or eGT models powered by the fantastic SR20DE producing approximately 150 BHP ; the 1991 to 1996 P10 model is the best handling and lightest of the primera's ;-)
