kthxdie
Variant of [kthxbye] and [kthxbai], but with a mordant edge. ; The original term [kthxbye] (okay, thanks, bye) is generally used to terminate a (n online) conversation in a quick manner, often with slight insult to the other party. The implication is that the other person is not even worth talking to. ; [kthxdie] is like that, only more so, and with an added death wish.
