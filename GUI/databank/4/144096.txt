American food
Simplified and modified cuisines copied from all over the world. Mostly hearty and greasy food, they are pan-fried, deep fried or baked. Seldomly steamed, and do not include other body parts from any animal besides their meats. Since fast food restaurants are so abundant in America, one could argue that American food actually implies fast food.
