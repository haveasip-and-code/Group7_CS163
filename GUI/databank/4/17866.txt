bigmics
A meaning in it's purest form. The term has been around for a little over 20 years now. It can be spending a long night on the computer during the summer playing Starcraft, it can be the personification of an inanimate object, or it can be straight bigmics. Bigmics is not only a person, but a state of mind. Not only a state of mind, but a reason behind the existance. It is the reason toes are on our feet and fingers are on our hands.
