wellbutrin
The best anti-depressant that I've ever tried. It can make you anxious or irritable, but it starts working WAY quicker than SSRIs. Beginning dose is generally 150 mg, treatment dose is 300 mg, and if ineffective or tolerance developed, 450 mg. It is NOT an SSRI and it does not have sexual side effects. Should not be taken by people with [bulimia], history of [seizure]s, etc.
