holy child - rye
we are preppy. we are rich. we look really good in our little skirts and in your boyfriends arms. don't mess with us, we come in packs (especially to the bathroom). burberry, louis vitton, coach, you name it we have it. jeep and volkswagon are the most popular cars in our lot. we live for dress down days and pj pants. and we are never in uniform. starbucks is where we hang out and westchester is where we live. we party all the time and document the whole event on film. by cell or aim we are reached, but dont bother if your not in our league.
