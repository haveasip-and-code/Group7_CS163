Back to School
Almost like a holiday season, it takes place between the last 3 weeks before school starts and the first 3 weeks after school starts. Major corporations like Walmart and JCPenny feed off [your mom]s money and encourage more of it with their abysmal advertising of back to school sales. Your parents seem to tease and taunt you that school is on its way to the point that you'll want to vomit uncontrollably.
