The Family Circus
The stupid round cartoon that makes me want to take the newspaper and tear it up and light it on fire and feed the ashes to my dog. Preaches good 'Christian' values such as mispronouncing words, leaving dotted lines behind when you walk, and having creepy dead grandpa ghosts. The characters consist of about 18 moronic kids that are pretty much clones of each other. The writer's like three centuries old and he needs to die.
