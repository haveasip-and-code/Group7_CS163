Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)
A combination of client-centered therapy, cognitive therapy, and sarcasm, designed by [Albert Ellis]. REBT acts to remove unreasonable cognitive beliefs, for example, [musterbation]. Its basic premise is that emotional suffering is due primarily to the often unverbalized assumptions and demands that people carry around with them as they negotiate their own way in life; for example, demanding perfection in oneself and/or in others. ; REBT has been shown to reduce self-reports of anxiety in general and specific forms; reduce type A behavior patterns; reduce depression, anger, and, in children, antisocial behavior; and help emotionally healthy people cope better with everyday stress.
