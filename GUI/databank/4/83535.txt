The Office
A prime example of British comedy at its best. Originated in Britain (obviously) but followed up by America with 'The Office - An American Workplace' which, frankly, uses American humour and all our best quotes eh boys ;) ; Co-written by [Ricky Gervais] and [Steven Merchant] who also appeared at Live 8 this year! - www.rickygervais.com/video2_1.php
