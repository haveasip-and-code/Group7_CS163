sploosh delay
Sploosh Delay is the silence that occurs for about 2 or 3 seconds after a [port-o-potty] has been tipped over. After this silence, a fairly loud 'splooshing' sound can easily be heard. At this point, whatever was inside the toilet will come flowing out of the openings at the top of the port-o-potty, and also out of the door if it was tipped on its face.
