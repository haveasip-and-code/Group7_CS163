pince-nez
Pince-nez (also known as Oxford glasses) are a style of spectacles which were popular in the 19th century. They are supported without earpieces by pinching the bridge of the nose. Their name comes from the french, meaning 'to pinch the nose'. Pince-nez first appeared in the 1840's, reaching their popularity around 1880 to 1900. They experienced a revived popularity in the late 1990's and in 2000, with the release of [The Matrix]. One of the main characters, Morpheus, wore a pair of reflective Pince-nez as part of his outfit.
