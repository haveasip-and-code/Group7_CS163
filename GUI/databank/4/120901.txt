Super Sonic
In Sonic the hedgehog 2, Sonic can become 'Super' by collecting 7 chaos emeralds while holding 50 rings and pushing 'Jump' twice. He becomes an invincible golden hedgehog that can run super fast and jump incredible hights, not to mention he can run accross water at will. And as he was created before dragonball z, i doubt sega ripped them off, more likely it was the other way around.
