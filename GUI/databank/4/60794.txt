RUNNING WILD WITH RON YUSHACK
Last of the great NYC public access TV comedians who fell on hard times, became homeless, and went literally 'running wild' in the streets. Was also at the time a gopher for Local TV legend Joe Franklin. Ron Yushack eventually ended up in Bellevue Hospital, and soon afterwards disappeared into the cold, gritty wilderness of madness, and obscurity. <BR> ; Where is Ron Yushack?
