jackman
The word Jackman first showed up in the mid to later 1980's and originates from the Island of Maui, Hawaii. The 1st meaning of the word Jackman is a reference that women used to describe a man who could completely and throughly sexually satisfy them with the target referent individual a notied local named 'Jack Martin'. It was said that his smooth approach, sexual skills, prowess, endurance and imagination were second to none, leaving the fortunate woman 100% satisfied having only hopes of another(see)[jakattack] future engagement. (see 1) ; The 2nd meaning, recorded mid 1997 on the mainland [Portland, Oregon], is indeed a derivitive of the first yet has a suttle difference. This 2nd meaning describes a feeling of contentment, fulfillment and expectation of a positive outcome or future; as in: 'seeing G W Bush go all the way to Bagdad was jackman!' Sometimes mixed with the fisrt meaning only if the situation is germane. (see 2) ; The 3rd and present meaning is evolved from somewhat from the other two. 'Jackman' is now heard in the context of of positive expectation of performance or outcome or to describe that trait to someone, mostly males as given by females. The confidence of a positive known outcome; as in: 'just one more little piece and our deal will be jackman!' (see 3)
