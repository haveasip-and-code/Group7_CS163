ano del caldo
slang term used by Mexican and Mexican Americans to describe somthing that is outdated and antiquated. Literally (or cliterally) means 'year of the stew.' The underlying idea is that anyone who heard this would ask 'Year of the stew? when was that?' and the reply would be, 'so so long ago, no one remembers...'
