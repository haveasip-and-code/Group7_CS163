john williams
The most popular contemporary composer of the current times. You wrote the Theme for Jaws, which is a rip off of Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 in E minor. He wrote many other works for movies that are quite good, but nothing that stands out by itself, except Fiddler on the Roof and Schindler's List, which are known primarily by violinists.
