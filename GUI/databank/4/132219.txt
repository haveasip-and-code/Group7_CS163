Work
Something that is meant to get done but doesn't. Also can be faked by type garbage in word and giving it to your boss. Consists of a tie and pen with a dash of fun. Work is the equivilent to naptime to a small child. Work is the reason people sell drugs for a living (they make a profit while being high and doing no work).
