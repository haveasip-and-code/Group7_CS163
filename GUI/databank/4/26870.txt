it's raining men
phrase used to describe a person, group of people or concept as being homosexual. the phrase originates from the song 'It's raining men' by 'The Weather Girls' (later by that slut, Geri Halliwell), which has been a song popular among the gay communities since it was released. often this is used to describe a person as being gay without using some trigger words which may arouse other listeners' suspicions.
