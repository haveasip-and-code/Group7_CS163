MyLife
A somewhat pejorative phrase referring to [Myspace], an online community. Referred to as such because a majority of those with Myspace accounts tend to spend hours on end perusing different accounts, making bulletins and blogs, listening to bands, and pretty much spending their existance on the addicting website.
