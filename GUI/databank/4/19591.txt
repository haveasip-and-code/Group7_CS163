feelings
Everyone has feelings. Emotional feelings. Yet all the faggots that listen to psytrance and rap crap deny they have any and anyone that does is an 'emo pussy'. Yeah right. Stop denying you have feelings and stop trying to 'buff up' your 'masculinity'. You do have feelings. And for the guy who said 'feelings are for bitches': ; Go fuck yourself. Go out driving your riced out Civic blaring your rap music. You don't deserve to be on here.
