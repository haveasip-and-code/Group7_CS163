Sevilla
A town in the Southern part of Spain, Andalucia. It contains to football teams, the most famous and ofcourse better Real Betis and the more shitty one Sevilla. Betis won everything from the Spanish Cup to the Champions League, and every year in the derby (worst in Spain) Sevilla becomes Green and White!
