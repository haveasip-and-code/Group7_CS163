Degrassi Junior High
A follow up of the show 'The Kids of Degrassi Street'. Degrassi Junior High is an 80's Canadian show filmed in Toronto; about teens dealing with issues of drugs, sex/pregnancy, family abuse, dating, shop lifting, and other coming of age issues. The episodes are usually dramatic and hilarious at the same time. This also spawned another great show 'Degrassi High' and a TV movie 'Degrassi: Schools Out' and a less creative show 'Degrassi: Next Generation'. This show had some funny lines such as You [broomhead]!
