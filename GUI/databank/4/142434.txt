P-City
Nickname for Pocomoke City, also called Potsmoke City (just replace two letters and it describes the town perfectly). P-City is a small town located on the eastern shore of Maryland. For the most part, the population consists of extreme red-necks and wanna-be thugs. Everyone in P-City likes to party like it's 1999. Also, the people of this town have thier own signature call (simliar to a bird call, only locals call it the 'weed call') to identify each other in a crowd, which sounds like an 'oui!'. Soccer and basketball are huge sports in this town, because it's too small for a football team.
