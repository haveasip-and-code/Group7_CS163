dattebayo
Okay people, it's time to update you all since Naruto finnally came out translated fully in english audio. Dattebayo means 'believe it.' He ends his sentances with this all the time. If you want proof, watch Naruto on Cartoon Network's Toonami lineup. I believe it's on at 9 pm eastern time.
