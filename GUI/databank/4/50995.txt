destinos
An educational soap opera made by some guys at the University of Illinois-Champagna. The purpose of Destinos is to immerse lowere level college and mid level high school Spanish students in the language. Its format is based on the Spanish 'telenovela' soap formula, different from the U.S. and others because there is actually a plot, hmm, what a novel idea!
