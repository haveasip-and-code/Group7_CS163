team rocket
A pair of humorous, yet stupid villians that try to steal Ash's Pikachu, pretty much using the same stupid techniques. They allways have a new motto every episode but here's the best one. ; Prepare for trouble i'm extremely baked ; And make it double for heavens sake ; To protect the world from devasation ; to unite all peoples within our nation ; to denounce the evils of truth and love ; to extend our reach to the stars above ; Jesse! James! Team rocket smokes a blunt at the speed of light! ; Surrounder now before we get the munchies or prepare to fight fight fight! ; Meowth That's right! Wobbuffet! Chime Chime Chime!
