base jumping
BASE jumping literaly stands for Building, Antenna, Span (bridge), Earth (cliff). ; When skydiving isnt quite enough what do you do, base jump. Jumping from a fixed object. It is the craziest fucking shit ever. Basicaly you find a building or anything thats about 400ft and up, and jump off pulling your chute only seconds from the ground. If your reall skilled you do some flips and spins on the way down. There a some hot spots around the world like New River Gorge Bridge (USA), Petronas Towers (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and many more.
