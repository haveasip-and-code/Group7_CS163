One of my favorite movies. The plot is simple, The Chosen One wants to avenge his family so he tries to defeat Evil Betty/Master Pain with the help of Ling, Master Tang, Whoa, Mu-Shu Fasa, and a little from Master Doe. Some people say this movie is stupid, that's the whole reason why I found it so funny.
