Will you ally me?
A phrase commonly heard among people who play Starcraft on [battle.net]. After totally pwning a n00b, they will usually ask if you would be kind enough to ally with them before their base is completely and utterly decimated by your largely superior army so they can get a win on their record instead of a loss. Because allying with the loser misrepresents the win/loss record, the answer should always be no.
