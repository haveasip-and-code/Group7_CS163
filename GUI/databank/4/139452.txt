Blue State
States full of people who voted for John Kerry in the last election. Unfortunatly we were forced to vote for Kerry because the Democratic party are big pussies and wont give us a decent candidate and everybody in the nation is too scared to vote for an independent candidate. I decided to list a definition for blue state after reading another definition where some ass listed a bunch of reasons blue states suck. After reading said list i said out loud 'Damn its good to be a blue state.' ; All in all 'South Park' was right: we had to choose between a douche and a shit sandwhich.
