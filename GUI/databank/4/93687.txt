embalming fluid
An uncommon nickname for the psychoactive drug Phencyclidine (PCP). ; PCP is a dissociative hallucinogen, meaning it causes the mind to separate from the body in medium to high doses, hence the term 'dissociative.' ; It is in no way similar to LSD, except for the hallucinogenic properties, but it is nowhere near as visually strong as LSD25, Psilocybin (mushrooms), or N,N,DMT (other, much more visual hallucinogens). ; Also known as: Angel Dust, PCP
