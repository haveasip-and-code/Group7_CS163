montessori
Name of Italian woman doctor and anthropologist who studied children's behavior for the first half of the 20th century. She developed an educational system that allows children to learn and experience the world with the goal of being a thoughtful, contributing member of society. Often called 'cosmic education' because of its well-rounded approach. Very often misunderstood in the USA because teacher-led classrooms are in direct opposition to Montessori's student-led method of learning.
