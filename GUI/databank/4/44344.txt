mini truck
The 'mini truck' or 'minitruck' started as a fad in the mid to late '80s that still exists today. They are so popular becuase they are cheap to build becuase most of the work you do yourself, and there aren't many store bought parts involved. Originally the mini truck was a stock Nissan, Toyota, Mitsubishi, or the famed Mazda B2200 with cut spings and lowering blocks to lower the truck and most had a set of hammer style (or similar) wheels with low profile tires. Wire wheels were also popular, but were more of a lowrider thing. Huge stereo systems with tons of bass were also added to these trucks. In the early '90s people started putting air-ride or hydrolics into their trucks to lower them even more. The modern day mini truck can be anything from a 1970 Datsun to a 2004 S-10. Most have 17' or larger wheels on them, but some people still like the smaller wheels. Body modifications include shaving doorhandles, corner turn signals, gas doors, tailights, mirrors, and just about anything else you can think of. Many people mold in later model Cadillac tail lights or other lights that look better than the stock ones. Minitrucks are not tuners and they are not lowriders. They are in a class all by themselves.
