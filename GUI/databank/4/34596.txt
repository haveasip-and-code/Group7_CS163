retard
v. re-TARD ; 1. (non-transitive) to decelerate. ; 2. (transitive) to cause a given object to decelerate. ; Note: This word is NOT a noun, therefore anyone who descends to the level of naming an unfortunate person with mental disabilities (actually known as a retardee, a subject of mental retardation) a 'retard' (with a mysterious emphasis on the first syllable) can be classified as illiterate, and can be ignored as a result. These people should be ignored anyway as they obviously have no sense of decency or sensitivity. This also applies to people who call non-retardees, 'retards', implying that to be a 'retard' indicates a status worthy of ridicule.
