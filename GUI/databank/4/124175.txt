pantser
noun: one who performs a [pantsing] on a [pantsie]. Sharing the pronunciation of the German word for 'armor', the [pantsie] believes the pantser is, in fact, some kind of Nazi fascist scum. Actually, the pantser is a sort of public defender of taste, e.g. the pantser shows the absurdity of publicly displaying one's underwear by showing even more of the [pantsie]'s skivvies. A pantser absolutely will NEVER pants a person whose pants are worn properly; this violates The Pantser Creed (definition to follow-or not).
