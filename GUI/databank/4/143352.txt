Upper Canadian
How a Canadian [Maritimer] refers to people from Ontario without resorting to profanity. The expression dates back to the early 19th Century, when what is now Ontario was known as 'Upper Canada.' ; 'Lower Canada' was what is now Quebec, but interestingly enough, English-language Maritimers (i.e. not [Acadians]) don't use the phrase 'Lower Canadian' when referring to the [Quebecois]. In the latter case, they don't seem to see the need to avoid resorting to profantity.
