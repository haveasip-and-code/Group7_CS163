domeshape
1) Used to describe, or ask for validation, on an actual object which bears a dome-like resemblance to an aforementioned or predescribed primary template that has been widely accepted as THE Domeshape. ; 2) An exclamation of near highest order used to express a myriad of feelings from simple boredom, to fill the time, to extreme anger, possibly in an effort to, in a rather half assed and semi-polite way, ridicule the protruding belly of a pompous jackass. ; 3) A versatile expression used by chui's, yui's, tangy's, PEPPs, matayoshi's, chowi's and a select few others...often accompanied by a dome hand gesture... similiar to one acting as if polishing a curved surface along a horizontal axis.
