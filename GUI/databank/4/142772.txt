enemarexia
Patterned after 'Anorexia' and '[tanorexia].' A semi-disorder characterized by an insatiable need to undergo enemas, often associated with a fear of uncleanliness when playing the passive role in anal sex. Usually refers to self-administered enemas, but not always. Common among [anal retentive] [bottom]s. Occasionally but not necessarily coincident with [Klismophilia].
