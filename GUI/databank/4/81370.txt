gnoob
(Juh-noob) This is a new online word coming from the word [noob] and [newbie] . It is always used as an insult, meaning a really big noob. Usually used when 'noob' just doesn't explain on how big of a noob the person really is, so you use gnoob. Also used after pwning another player in an online game.
