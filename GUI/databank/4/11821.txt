intelligent design
Intelligent Design is the idea that some all-powerful being created the original elements of the universe or is guiding the events of the universe. This is different from [creationism], which is basicly the idea that god made the entire world, as it is today, in a matter of days. Intelligent design is in contrast with [evolution] and [natural selection], which has the development of life occuring by chance. Intelligent Design is primarily used to explain how creatures as different and complex as humans have come to be. ; I myself don't believe one way or the other, and don't really think it matters. If one day we learn for a fact that the world was created by a giant blue pastry, how is that going to change our lives? It won't.
