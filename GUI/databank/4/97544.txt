eyes
eyes (n.) - Traditionally defined as a feature on a living creature's body that allows it to see, this simple area of the body is considered by some to be the most beautiful and mystifying physical feature of another person (especially the eyes of a woman). Unlike the [breasts], [legs], or [gluteus maximus] (which are often associated with physical beauty in women) the eyes hold value outside of the realm of sexuality. (Some would even argue that, for this reason alone, the admiration of a woman's eyes is more respectable and pure than being physically attracted toward some element of her sex.) Some men find the most dazzling feature of a woman to be her eyes, leaving everything else as all but completely irrelevant. Looking into a woman's eyes, one can sometimes peer into her soul.
