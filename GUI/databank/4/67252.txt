Stocker
1. A strong son-of-a-gun who loads up the shelves with consumer goods, in retail outlets. ; 2. The name of a long-forgotten 1986 Bally/Sente arcade game, in which you drive the 'General Lee' from Florida to California, avoiding cops, and trying not to run out of gas. A very primitive game, by today's standards -- or even the standards of the early 1990s. Not a bad time-killer, though.
