smorphing
Smorphing is an act of identity misrepresentation based on sharing a commercial identity among friends or co-workers. Derived from [phishing] and [morphing], smorphing occurs when someone shares their on-line account and password for fee-based on-line services to someone else who accesses the services pretending to be that person.
