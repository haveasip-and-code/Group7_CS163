bhenchood
Translated from Urdu to English, meaning 'sister-fucker'. This term started in South Asian ('Pakistan-India') when a guy named Salman was caught fucking his sister. This is socially unacceptable. The term was then used as an insult, and not neccesarily used to identify an 'actual' sister fucker.
