Harold and Maude
A [cliche] used to describe a couple in which one partner is significantly older than the other. ; Taken from the title of a [cult movie] (1971, Hal Ashby) starring Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon. Intergenerational love affair between a 20 and 79 year old, culminating in an important life lesson. Has an excellent [Cat Stevens] [soundtrack] and stellar photographic/cinematic effects given the technology of the time. For many, the closing sequence (last 15 minutes) of the film qualifies as one of the best endings in modern film.
