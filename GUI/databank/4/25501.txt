Utica
A city in Central New York. ; Summers are marked by hot, humid weather; winters by ice, snow that never melts, and -20 degree (F) weather. ; Despite its lack of distinguishing features, Utica has several upsides: ; 1. The recent host of the Simple Plan, Good Charlotte & Reliant K 'Noise to the World' Tour ; 2. The KRock-athon, an annual summer event inviting many of the hottest rock bands for an all day event ; 3. The Boilermaker, a summer race that attracts hundreds of people world-wide. ; When any of these events are not taking place, though, Utica remains just another dusty city that America forgot. ; Most, if not all people, want to leave it.
