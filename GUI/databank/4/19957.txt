yamamba
(lit. Mountain Witch) Fashion trend that arose in 1999 amongst teenage girls in the Shibuya district of Tokyo, Japan. It is expressed by means of extreme tanning (i.e. going to tanning salons 3-4 times a week), bleached hair, and white, silvery makeup. The Yamamba make fruitless attempts at getting attention from common Japanese, whilst providing as elaborate displays for [gaijin], or foreigners.
