MoCo
County in Central Maryland, bordering Washington D.C. Full of many rich people that wish they actually lived in the ghetto. Someone, please tell them to stop posing. There are some ghetto areas, of course, but the county tries its best not to let other people know. Montgomery county supposedly has great schools, but they're just puffed up. They just have the money to get better computers, that's all.
