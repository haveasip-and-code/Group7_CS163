Metalhead
A metal fan. ; People who call themselves Metalheads usually refuse to believe that anything besides their underground/old music is total shit and unbearable. Innovation is against the metal rules in their book. Of course not all metal heads are like this, but the one who try to stand out as hardasses are. If the band isn't 'true' then it's shitty in their eyes. Nu-metal such as System of a Down, Slipknot, and Korn are too weak for them so they call everyone who listens to it 'faggots'. They usually categorize nu-metal listeners as faggots following the mainstream, yet they still listen to the same shit their 'Metal head' dads listened to. ; Some new metal is good, some black metal is good, some death metal is good, some of everything is good. Grow the fuck up.
