ditch weed
This is a type of marijuana that grows wild, and is usually found in ditches (hence the name) and other thickets. It is very, very bunk and contains little to no thc. Legend has it that every 7 years it draws thc out of the ground. I dont know if this is true or not, but i will look into it.
