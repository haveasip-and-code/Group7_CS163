Aberystwyth
A large town in Wales, administrative hub of Ceredigion. ; It's also devoid of any redeeming features, and brings bad luck on any unlucky enough to visit the place. A haven for scallies from the valleys. ; Inhabited by students ([Fuck-fucketty-fuck-fuck-fuckers!]), english ex pats, and (mainly) a peculiar brand of Welsh who are neither [taff] nor [gog]. ; Apart from the sea and greenery (available countrywide!) it's literally the end of the line, with appalling nightlife, idiot promoters, and substandard venues.
