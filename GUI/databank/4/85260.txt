farting arround
In short, messing arround, wasting time (usually someone elses rather then your own) etc. ; Like an employee going to do something, then chatting with another employee for ten minutes, finally doing the job, on their way back chatting with another employee for another ten minutes, turning what should have been a 10 minute job into a 30 minute job. ; Another example is kids walking home from school, stopping every five minutes to play arround, turning a twenty minute walk into an hour long walk.
