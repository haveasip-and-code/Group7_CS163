Sov = abbreviation of Sovereign 'Antique Coinage' Once very collectable Now Sadly devalued due to the popular practice of setting the coin onto a ring producing extremely distateful jewellery. This jewellery,the flagship of the [Elizabeth Duke]@ [Argos] range normally no more than 9 carat and usually worn by the[chav] or other tasteless cretins. looks great with [Burberry]
