Ugh Factor 9 Stupidity factor 1 000 000
Possibly the closest thing to Ugh Factor 10 if not worse because of the added in Stupidity Factor. But regarless the equation works as shown below ; If (Ugh Factor + Stupidity Factor) > 10, ; then You = Loser ; But the speciality about the stupidity factor of 1,000,000 is that even though you're fashionably impetant, we don't want you to drop dead because we would appreciate it if you stuck around so we can always have a sweet laugh at your stupidity.
