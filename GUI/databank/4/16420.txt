buffalo
Buffalo is a city in upstate New York that has something for everyone: shopping, partying, parks, people, art festivals, snow in the winter, beautiful seasons, architectural treasures, restaurants of every kind, and affordable housing. We have our share of crooked politicians, but, hey, tell me some place that does not?
