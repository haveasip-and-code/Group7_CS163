Home of the 'Gang', a group of Juniors who feel the need to talk so loud that the entire lounge hears. While speaking to their friend who is 2 feet away from them, they tend to shout and look around the lounge to make sure people are looking at them and to see who is listening. Most of time people are looking, only not out of envy, which they think people are, but more-so thinking to themselves 'would they please shut up?'. They also feel the need to shout about their drunken/coke-infested/high weekends, thinking that no one else does these 'rebellious' things. Well, we're all laughing sooooo hard right now! We <3 the gang!
