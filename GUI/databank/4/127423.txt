magic brownie
Any type of brownie cooked with Cannabis butter ([Cannabutter]) in lieu of standard butter. The brownie is eaten, usually before smoking a [joint] or [blunt], and produces a much slower acting but often far more intense high than would be achieved through smoking the Cannabis flowers ([bud]).
