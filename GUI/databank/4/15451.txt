Machiavellian
Niccolo Machiavelli. ; Italian statesman during the 15th and 16th centuries. ; He wasn't the figure of corruption he is now taken to be, but a man who thought it was worth accepting a lesser evil to perpetuate a greater good. His skill, seen by those who disagreed with him, seemed almost demonic, which is how his name has become used now.
