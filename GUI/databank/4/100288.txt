breakdowns
Extremely sexy style of guitar riff used in modern Hardcore music, usually very slow, very brutal, and very orgasmic. like my friend NGspot says, 'There's beauty in the Breakdown' ; Some bands with some sexy breakdowns? ; Remembering Never, Symphony in Peril, Norma Jean, and One Must Fall. ; There are many more, but i'm sure you can figure that out.
