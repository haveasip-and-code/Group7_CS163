bud
The name of a male character in the children's entertainment, the 'Skyline Gang' at Butlin's. I think it's the same in Skegness and Bogner Regis, but the Bud at Minehead wears red dungarees over the top of a tight white t-shirt. He also wears a pair of red converse (well it looks like converse anyway.). His make-up consists of red eyeshadow stuff and red lipstick with a white line in the middle. As much as this make-up makes it sound like he looks really gay (and I'm not homophobic or anything, I have nothing against gay people) he is actually extremely fit. The person who plays him seems like a really nice person, and also plays someone called Jack in the pantomime 'Dick Whittington' at Butlin's. After that play, my brother and I couldn't really hear what he was saying when the photos were being taken because he was speaking too quickly. Other than talking a little bit too fast he is a really good entertainer who could go far, he is only young now and I wish him the best of luck in the future and hope that one day I shall meet him and talk to him.
