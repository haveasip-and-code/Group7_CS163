mike patton
Greatest vocalist in metal. Sung for Faith No More in place of the previously awful vocalist Chuck Mosely. He got the job based on a demo he handed FNM from his work with Mr Bungle. He worked these two bands together and made some messy and random music with Mr Bungle, all 3 albums vary greatly in genre, showcasing his diverse ability. His first album with FNM- The Real Thing was an epic 80's album although Angel Dust and the sub-sequent albums essentialy created the nu-metal genre. After the splitting of Faith No More he went into Fantomas, an even stranger band than Mr Bungle. In Fantomas. he rarely uses lyrics, instead using his voice as an instrument creating a variety of obscure noises. His latest band is the more linear Tomahawk. He's also performed on Dillinger Escape Plan EP- Irony is a Dead Scene and ventured into rap with General Patton vs The X Ecuctioners there's also his experimental solo work.
