Toms River
A town in New Jersey. Everybody knows you. We have 11 elementay schools 3intermeadit schools and 3 high school. Kids from HS North get made all the time. We are known for are little league baseball teams. The mall sucks ass, Cool beans is the only cool place to hang out after the movies. The beach gets over run by fricken new yorker every summer leaving no plcae for the locals. But yet house still go for 300,000+.
