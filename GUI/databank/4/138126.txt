Poeminister
an emoticon of unknown meaning and origin. Originaly bought to question by one GM of melbournebeats.c fame. Some dudes probably know what it means but I don't. Scholars maintain that the true meaning is probably known only to an extreme splinter group of l337 hax0rz, so leet that they use some new kind of internet that we don't even know about.
