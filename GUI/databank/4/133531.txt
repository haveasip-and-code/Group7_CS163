pure television
That feeling that life is imitating television instead of the other way around. When the lighting and circumstances, and occasionally music and costume seem to obey the laws of some preternatural executive producer in the sky and subjects become witness to their lives in much the same way that they would witness a film or television show. Even when alone individuals in the thralls of 'pure television' will act. It's fun when it only happens once in a while and one doesn't realize what's happened until after the fact, but if you're aware of it as it's happening? Self Hating Terror or Blissed Out Egomania are almost always the result.
