MUCK
May also be called Multi User Collective Kingdom or Multi User Construction Kit, depending on who you ask. The most common is Fuzzball MUCK, an open-source project. Two popular MUCKs are Tapestries and [Furry]MUCK. It is a text-based roleplay environment simmilar to a [MUD] but without the requirement to kill things and level.
