L337 (1337)
A coded language that substitutes letters for numbers. This 'language' is most commonly used in game chats, chat rooms, or any cumputer assisted way as it is quite impossible to speak. The birth of the language is unknown and probably impossible to trace, but it is believed to originate from game forums or web comics. (again, this is unconfirmed)
