Cloud
1. A puff of not-water in the sky. What a beauty. ; 2. Cloud Strife. A character from a boring video game called 'Final Fantasy 7'. Though as boring as it is (it's turn-based), many love it. I personally love the storyline, hate the fanboy/girl-ism he brings to everyone who loves the game, but do not hate him.
