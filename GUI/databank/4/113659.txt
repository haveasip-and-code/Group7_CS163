rufio
a useless pop-punk band that writes cliche music with the same time signature and chord progressions over and over again whining on and on about the girl that doesn't like them. They should put down their guitars, stop pleasuring themselves sexually with their drumsticks inserted into their rectums, and do something else with their lives other than play music. Also an asian boy from the movie Hook.
