Legion of Nod
The best Sole Survivor Squad of all time. Sole Survivor was a not-so-popular game spawned from Command and Conquer. It consisted of two teams fighting each other, with each person controlling one unit. One of the few games where you could get 20 people to play 20 people on a consistent, organized basis. The Legion was the brainchild of some bad ass motherfuckers.
