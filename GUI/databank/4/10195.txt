'bashing' bush
Most unquestionaing, bovine-like bush worshippers have similar hobbies... They usually include listening to garbage rock music, obsessing over the south, and bashing anyone who isn't President Bush, declaring him the best President ever despite having only lived under a grand total of 3 different Presidents. ; non-Bush bashing usually includes the infamously popular 'north vs south' argument, as well as the 'unpatriotic' factor. In reality, Bush's daddy had even more money and power, which is how bush jr got into yale, and a cushy tour in the national guard during vietnam despite effectively failing his pilot's exam. ; Many of them have really no legit reason to like President Bush. Although Bush has had one or two honest moves in his terms, few of them have affected any of his supporters directly. None of them are physically fit enough to go to war if there ever WAS a draft (which there won't be), none of them will ever get laid and have to worry about their partner getting an abortion, and few of them if any have jobs and even if they did, the 'tax breaks for the rich' (that means the more you earn the less taxes you pay, dumbass) aren't going to effect them... particularly because Bush + his close mates got most of the tax breaks and a big fat tax return, paid for by the millions of his supporters in the low and middle classes. ; Even worse are the ones that don't know about the world outside America, and reside in such politically important places (NOT) such as any of the thousands of one-horse shithole trailer parks. Bush is a faggot, i doubt he's ever taken a genuine risk in his entire life
