tahir
When he grew up he found that he was in many ways like a plant e.g a sunflower...he had phototropismic powers....his alarm was natrual...the sunlight pulled his hair towards the light...the excuciating paint...made him wake up...now tahir the plant enjoys watering his head and feeding it...no wonder we have droughts!
