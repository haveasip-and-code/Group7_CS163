Stress Press
A stress press is where you undergo a series of trials to help make a difficult decision. You begin by rubbing ice cubes on the nipples until the point of extreme nipple hardness, and stiffness. You then squeeze lemons on them making lemon juice and pouring it into a cup, drink this. It will truly help make a decision.
