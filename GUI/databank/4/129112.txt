Triumph Motorcycles
1. A British motorycle company which dominated the motorcycle market with their medium range (500-650cc) parallel twin cylinder engine cycles from the 1950s to the 1960s. The epitome of two wheeled motoring and the last of a line of motorcycles which possessed a soul. From the early 1970s, Japanese motorcycle companies such as Honda came upon the scene and killed the heart of the British motorcycle with low cost production motorcycles. ; 2. A British motorcyle that can beat a Harley-Davidson any day of the week. ; 3. A finicky breed of motorcycle which is not for the faint of heart. Plan on tinkering with the motorcycle frequently and dealing with leaking oil. It is a futile attempt to get it to completely stop.
