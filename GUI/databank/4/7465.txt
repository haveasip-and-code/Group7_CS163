Camel Spider
A huge athropod most commonly found in the Middle East. They can travel up to 10 mph, and feasts on lizards, birds, scorpions etc. Many rumors about these creepy-crawlers have been spread by US troops from the Persian Gulf War and the Operation Iraqi freedom, including a very popular picture of a troop holding up one.
