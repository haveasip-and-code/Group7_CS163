hard on
Threatening, angry, accusatory, entitled and generally mean spirited person usually found inhabiting the blue-collar netherworlds of Long Island and New Jersey (and probably Florida). Union laborers, store owners, police, bosses, government workers, toll booth clerks...usually anyone in a position of power or who controls the actions of others, no matter how minimally, and their tendencies to take out their frustrations with the world on their fellow human beings in a nasty, accusatory, judgemental, vindictive and sometimes violent way. Usually used by people guilty of this trait themselves, as they navigate their sad lives through the sea of like-minded Hard On's they have to interact with daily. Probably derived from the usage of Hard On as penile erection, and the need to gain immediate physical relief from it's urgency in a male, powerful and imposing way.
