american flag
Something to be burned every now and then. Something to not care about, along with every other flag or symbol in existence because all it is is a symbol, with a consentual meaning that doesn't actualy exist. Sadly, many people have died for a symbol or [lame] cause. Remember, that it is up to the individual to have freedom, and no system of government offers that. A person can decided to have freedom in any dictatorship, while an American can sit on their ass and watch the military channel thinking how great it is that she/he has freedom in theory but not in pracitce, for that American will be working for the American government for the rest of her\his life and will most likely value consumerism over action and desire.
