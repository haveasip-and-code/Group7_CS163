The scandal in which [liberal]-biased CBS newsanchor Dan Rather aired on his 60 Minutes program documents that supposedly showed that George W. Bush received favorable treatment during his service as a national guardsman. The documents were later shown to be false. As a result, Rather's career has gone down the toilet, and he is resigning and stepping down from CBS Nightly News, effective as of March 2005.
