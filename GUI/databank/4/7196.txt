Australian Rules football
The most over-rated football game in the world. Skinny weak 'men' fumbling a football around for 2 hours. No skill. No courage. No toughness. No contact, It's called 'Aussie Rules' by its southern fans. Everyone else in Australia calls it 'Pussie Rules' or 'Netball with kicking'. Give it a miss.
