Satriani
oh please people! Do your fucking research. Once again, SATRANI DID NOT TEACH VAI. he simply played with him a few times, improved him improvisational skills and taught him a few tricks. And for the record, Vai is actually better than Satriani, has alot more imagination and can play a damn sight quicker to. Don't get me wrong, i love Satch. I do.
