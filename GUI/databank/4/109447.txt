pork roll
n: a pork meat found almost exlusively in New Jersey. It can be compared to ham, sausage, bacon, or Canadian bacon, but it has its own distinct flavor. Pork Roll is primarily eaten as a breakfast meat, and usually fried and eaten on a sandwich with eggs and/or cheese. It is also referred to as Taylor Ham, but this is a misnomer because Taylor Ham is a brand name of pork roll, which is the product.
