moonbat
term used by those on the extreme political right wing (known as 'wingnuts') to describe anyone who disagrees with their bizarre, fascistic world view. Used, despite the fact that it makes absolutely no sense, because they could not come up with a word or phrase as appropriately descriptive as 'wingnut.'
