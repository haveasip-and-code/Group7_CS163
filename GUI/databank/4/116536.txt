Chav / Chavette
Ahh the race of chavs. The newest known danger to the world, atmosphere and mainly Barry and Cogan. Chavettes - even cooler! Keep them babies comin' young mothers - WE LOVE IT! Things commonly associated with chavs - burberry, the word 'like', tracksuits, dunks, hats, fags, gold earrings, booze, 50 cent, The Vibe, Creation, the words 'innit, ini', the word ' safe ', the word 'fock' and many more! Romily park in Barry - lush place...now...chav central! It's bloody brilliant! All the shmooookers with asbo's! How fabulous!A term that represents the current youth culture of britain. Easy to spot, just look for people with gangsta limps and fake jewelery too heavy to carry. White chavs often think they're black, and black chavs just follow the rest of the rules above. Do not disrespect a chav ...to their face, or they will as I'm sure they'll tell you - 'fock you up' which although sounds EXTREMELY FUN ( a bunch of chavs chasin after you shouting and swearing - GREAT:D) would most probably be painful!
