One of the few shows that actually make me laugh out loud. Most funny shows (South Park, Beavis and Butthead, stand-up comics like [Dennis Leary] but not racist twatsuckers like [Chris Rock]) usually draw a grin from me. YET another [Adultswim] comedy goldmine (other fine examples are [Futurama], [Family Guy], and [Aqua Teen Hunger Force]).!
