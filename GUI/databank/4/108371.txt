laundrodelica
Any musak heard in a laundromat in the 1970's. Experience is perfected by the presence of avacado green dryers, burnt umber washing machines, wallpaper with orange asterisks, contact paper on the countertops festooned with olive drab polka-dotted mushrooms, and Family Circle magazines in the seating area.
