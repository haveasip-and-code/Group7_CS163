Jack Osbourne
Talentless piece of shite, actually believes he's a good producer or whatever eventhough he fails to understand he's where he is only thanks to daddy's money. It's more of an occupation than a real vocation. ; Too fat, probably from stuffing his face with too many rich foods. ; The definition of a meaningless life : due to his father's achievements he will continue to live off his money like a spoilt brat all his life...and probably get fatter in the process.
