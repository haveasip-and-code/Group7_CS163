walthamstowe
A place populated with care bears. ; There is a long market with snide (fake) clothing sold everywhere and a woman selling aki and salt fish dumplings. ; Almost everyone in walthamstowe is ugly and the good looking people hide in walthamstowe market. A place of typical eski (east london) calibur who in there right mind would live there... well no black people anyway.
