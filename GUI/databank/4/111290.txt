Stanfurd
Leland Stanfurd Junior University. It is located in the crotch of the San Francisco Bay, in Palo Alto. Known for being an overpriced country club and not a true university. Home to a dysfunctional band and an idiotic tree as their mascot. Their students suffer from 'Cal envy'. They all wish they could wear the Blue and Gold. Go Bears!!
