ohkaaayy
The pronunciation of the word 'okay,' intended to convey disapproval with someone or their comments. This word is pronounced with a deep, gutteral tone and should come across as sounding like a mentally retarded person. Do not be confused with Lil' Jon's pronunciation of the word 'okay,' as it is much different from this one.
