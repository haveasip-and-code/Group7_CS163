scraper
This is OFFICIAL AS IT GETS straight from the place where it ORIGINATED, Oakland CALI. ; A Scraper is a late 80's to late 90's General Motors made (affordable) luxury car with rims so big (20-22') that the tires rub the inside of the fender and frame. The most common Scraper is made by Buick and includes Regals, Centurys, Park ave's, and Le Sabres. Oldsmobile Cutlass, Cutlass Supreme's, and 88's as well as Pontiac Bonnevilles, and the ugliest one of all, a Chevy Lumina are all considered Scrapers when ridin' on 20's. Slap in the trunk is a must, but the tint, whistle and suction tips, dvd screens, and candy paint is all optional. The way you set your shit up seperates your whip from all the other scrapers out there. That's why you will probably never see 2 identical Scrapers.
