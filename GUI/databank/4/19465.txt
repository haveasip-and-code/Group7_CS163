Chuck Taylors
The illest shoe ever made. So simple yet so sick. I wore these shoes all my life. They were first made in the 1950's and have been worn since then by all types of people, including gangsta rappers, rockstars, b-ballers, skaters, and people who just like to chill. Now, due to faux pop-punkers like Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, and Green Day, they have become increasingly popular with trendy poser chicks. Some geeky goth kids wear em too. But thanks to rappers such as the Game they are being reclaimed by blacks, the group that really rocked them in the first place. I don't really care what clique wears them, I'm gonna keep wearing them forever. I just hope the females don't completely take over the shoe and make it a feminine shoe to wear like they did the Adidas superstar. Oh well. They still rock, and always will. ; Oh, and only posers buy the lame low top chucks. High tops all the way, baby!
