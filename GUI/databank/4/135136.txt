Pengvwin
A pengvwin is anyone who acts like they have something they don't. This can be a physical attribute, mental or simply a possesion. They usually are very annoying too. ; Pengvwins can be found very often in the British [chav] culture, as the small midgets within large groups. Also female pengvwins can be found attached to groups of popular girls groups, acting like Barbie while they actually look like a very masculine Ken.
