Barrymore
Michael Barrymore the comedian, was on t.v in Britain for most of the 90's. He hosted shows like 'kids say the funniest things' on sunday afternoons which proved mildly popular with pensioners and half-wits. When the nineties came to an end and the new millenium began, things started to go down hill for Barrymore. His notorious pool-party and the death of his nephew had his shows cancelled. ; The police ran a lengthly investigation into the events of the party and concluded that Mike was innocent. Also that his nephew had taken it up the arse rather savagely before drowning in a swimming pool, due to the excessive use of alcohol. ; After reading this text, you should now know that Michael Barrymore is a huge JOKER. It is obvious that his name will haunt the batties in the playgrounds across England for centuries to come.
