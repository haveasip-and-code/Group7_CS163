Divine intervention
When god makes something happen. A prime example is when in the 2001/02 season when west brom had to win at bradford in the 2nd last game of the season to be in the front seat for promotion ahead of deadly rivals wolves. We never really looked like scoring, but then out of knowhere, the ball was hoofed into the box, and bob taylor was fouled and we had a penalty!! Igor balis slotted it way and we went up next weekend. Cheers god, I owe you one.
