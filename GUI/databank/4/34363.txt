V Day
V Day or [Vagina] Day is a day established by [Eve Ensler], author of the [Vagina Monologues], to end domestic violence and sexual abuse of women. It is celebrated on Valentine's day and many communities put on plays from parts of the Vagina Monologues or additional stories related to orgasms, menarche, first sexual experiences, sexuality, molestation, rape, etc. They express what a vagina would say if it could talk. Proceeds from the plays go towards centers for [domestic violence] and [rape] preventions.
