meader
Noun (mee-durh) origin: Bristol, GB (after the area Southmead) ; Used to define a wide range of people who come from a lower form of life (in Hindu culture usually referred to as [Untouchables]). These people should all be murdered brutally, or they will destroy all the norms. They commonly use words such as '[jitter]' to describe anyone else other than them, because they have no brain capacity to relate to different people. They will often be found sitting in parks drinking white lighting or smoking grass (the actual stuff, not canabis) and listening to mainstream urban music (which quite frankly is [bollocks]) rather than the actual good alternative hip-hop. The tend to think that what is in the charts is talent (the cause of this phenomenon - Chart Music Good, or CMG - is as yet unknown). They will often be seen riding scooters or mopeds for some reason thinking it is acceptable to think that they are being 'cool'. They try to scare common people by being complete knobends and texting endlessly because they are too fat to make proper conversation. These people should be treated with extreme caution before being tied up and gassed.
