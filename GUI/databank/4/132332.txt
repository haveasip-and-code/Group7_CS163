United states of america
The second largest nation on the North American continent, situated between Canada to the north and Mexico to the south. ; The only political and military superpower left on earth, it is held in contempt and jealousy by others, albeit sometimes not without merit. ; Home to the oldest written constitution still in effect, it has benefited from almost 230 years of political stability. Because of this, and it's many natural resources, it has been blessed to have the largest economy in the world. ; Sometimes confused with their government, the citizenry is generous and truly believes in the 'American Dream', i.e., that if you work hard enough, and long enough, you can succeed in your endeavors. ; It is a country of immigrants, not ethnicity; anyone can become an American, but not all can be a Japanese, or a German, or a Russian, etc. ; It's government, such as all governments, has in the past, (and some argue now) let it's people down by not living up to it's expectations. In America however, that government can be removed not by bullets, but by ballots.
