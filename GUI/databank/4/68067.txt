devvo
David Firth, creator of Fat-pie.com and animator of salad fingers, decided to ply Darren Davenport a chav from Doncaster? with alcohol and money in order to document his 'Propa Fucking space Head' life. ; There are 2 scopes of thought on this: ; 1. Devvo is NOT real, he is simply a friend who is taking the piss out of chavs ; - How come devoo never attempts to steal the camera? ; -He kicks the ground and makes a fool of himself in 'Devvo As Out' ; -The way he says 'Aite une wat une up tune?' in a comical fashion. ; 2. Devvo IS real ; I mean come on i have seen thousands of devvos everywhere, this is possibly his normal behaviour. ; - He does take drugs in the film, no actor would take it that far ; - He says some incredible things that cannot be made up. ; - He really does mug that guy.. ; YOU DECIDE.
