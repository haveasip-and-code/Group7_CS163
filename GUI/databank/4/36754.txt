fauxternative
Kids who think they are cool and alternative when they are really not, and are just crap at life. These kids tend to sit around having 'jam' sessions on their guitars, believe in socialism (when they really have no idea wtf it is), wear black nailpolish and have dreads, but on the inside are little mummy's boys who ain't hardcore. They also probably wear coloured underwear.
