Jarrettsville
Ah, Jarrettsville. Possibly the shittiest place on earth. The entire place is full of white trash inbred hicks. The hardcore white trash kids hang out at the local 7-11 all the time. This includes weeknights and weekends. Tuesday nights even, trash can be seen scattered around the 7-11 parking lot. There happens to be one particular trash pit, located off of good old Morse road. This area, known to locals as 'The Hood' is a deceiving neighborhood. Under the surface it is really Jarrettsvilles finest. It contains elements native only to Jarrettsville. Some of which include an actual lock on some powerlines thrown there by some kids, a working lightswitch on a streetlight, and some kid and a funny [Geo Metro]. This certain Geo can be seen cruising around the hood 24/7, crashing through things and breaking stop signs throughout Jarrettsville.
