Wisconsin
1. A state full of cheese, farms, beer, and football fans. ; 2. A state full of people who are always trying to prove they are better than every other state, especially Illinois and Minnesota (I'm not saying we are better, we're just trying to convince everyone we are. I don't want to start any fights with this statement.)
