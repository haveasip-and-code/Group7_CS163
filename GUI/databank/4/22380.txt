duel masters
A [TCG](aka [CCG]) being supposed to be a simplified Magic:The Gathering with some ripped-off elements from the Yu-Gi-Oh tcg. ; The anime is just some random rip-off from the YGO anime. The figures got horrible hair styles and most of the series they talk about them. ; Even tho badly dubbed with 'Heart of the cards' invented shit, YGO by far outbeats this; The TCG aswell. ; Short said: Magic:tG for n00bs.
