Me for longer
A phrase you say when something happened to both you and someone else, but it happened to you for a longer period of time. Such as if it took you 3 hours to do something and some else comes up and is all like, 'Yo man, the jive took me like 2 hours to do, I was worken on that forever.' You then would say, 'Me for longer'. ; It also has relevance in skateboarding and surfing such as if you slide a rail or ride a wave for longer thn some one else. You win because it was you for longer.
