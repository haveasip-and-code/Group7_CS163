Leonia
A one-square mile town that nobody knows about because by the time you finish asking what town you are in, your already leaving.This town is very boring, and has absolutely nothing to do in it. The most fun kids can find is hanging out at the Dunkin Donuts, and going to the park. Most older people like it because it is a 'quiet town'
