Venice
A town in West Central Florida. It is a very artsy town, with lots of old retired people living in it. The retirees think they've lived here all their life, so they think they have to complain to the city council when a bulding is too high, or some 'young folks' are out skateboarding. They generally drive like shit and think they have the rights to everything, whether it be a good parking spot at [Publix] or right of way on the roads. Venice has a small airport also.
