Cao Pi
Cao Pi (oddly enough, pronounced 'cow pee') was the first emperor of the Wei kingdom (located in northern china. Capital at Xu Chang. Western Wei contained Chang An, currently known as Xi'an) in the three kingdoms period of china. He was the son of Cao Cao (slayer of Lu Bu and many others) and husband to many wives, the most notable being Empress Zhen, who he later forced to commit suicide. ; Cao Pi died soon after gaining the throne, though, and passed his rank to son Cao Rui, who did a pissant job for the most part. ; Cao Pi is remembered throughout China as a tyrant and cold-hearted man. He was written in the book 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' to have commited atrocious acts, but due to the bias in this book nobody can be sure. ; Relatives: Cao Zhen, Cao Zhi, Cao Xiong, Cao Ren, Cao Cao, Cao Rui, Cao Xiu (notable)
