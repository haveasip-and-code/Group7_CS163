Gavin DeGraw
It's about damn time that someone come with a decent definition for this up-and-coming mega-superstar... ; With a combination of a sexy voice (I can say that even though I'm a guy because it's what it is), great vocals, and just raw talent, Gavin DegRaw is one great rookie of the music business. ; Gavin DeGraw, hailing from South Fallsburg, New York (near [The Catskills Mountains], close to my hometown), was born in February of 1977 to a prison-guard father, and specialist mother. ; Signed with '[J Records]', his album, 'Chariot', has sold roughly 800,000 copies, and counting... ; For those who are stuck on 'I Don't Wanna Be', and 'Chariot', you haven't heard a snippet of it! Listen to songs like... ; 'Follow Through' ; 'Meaning' ; 'More than Anyone' ; 'Belief' ; 'Crush' ; 'Just Friends' ; 'Over-rated' ; '(Nice to Meet You) Anyway' ; 'Chemical Party' ; He's also done many acoustic versions of songs, as well as many remakes of past great songs such as 'A Change is Gonna Come' by Sam Cook, and an awesome remake of '[We Are the Champions] by [Queen]' ; All-in-all, given a good two years and great promotion, this man will be one of the biggest household names in music since [The Beatles].
