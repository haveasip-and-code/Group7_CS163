Eleventeen
A Korn [fanboy] of questionable lineage, whose name has now become a noun for all Korn fanboys. His fanboyism is rivaled by few and exceeded by none. He haunts MusicianForums, waiting to fly into a raging fury the instant he comes across someone who doesn't have Korn's shriveled penis lodged firmly in their mouthparts. ; His typing is negatively affected by the fact that one of his hands is always employed in masturbating to pictures of Jonathan Davis. ; He frequently misreads posts due to the volume of semen encrusted on his face and obscuring his vision. ; Few things in life are more fun that watching him hammer out a grammatrically challenged flame, and by all accounts, actually provoking him is several orders of magnitude more fun that ramming rusty shish-kebob skewers into your ears.
