media moth
A person whom flies toward any collection of reporters in an attempt to bring their personal issues to light on slow news days. Pest sprays only encourage them, and often draws other media moths to the infestation. Media Moths usually do something outrageous or unusual to draw attention then perform a slow spiral of self inflicted damage until their flame is extinguished by the scrutiny of people with common sense, or by a bigger news story.
