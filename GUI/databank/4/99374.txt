red wine
Red wine is a type of alcohol which may result in people calling you 'gay' or 'old' for drinking it, but these are the same people who prefer to drink alcohol - such as vodka, lager or absinthe - simply for the purpose of getting drunk. ; Red wine goes well with a nice pasta, and it is good for you ; (in moderation of course)
