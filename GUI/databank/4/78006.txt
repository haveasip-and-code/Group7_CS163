national bohemian
Maryland's pride and joy, as far as beer goes at least. Brewed along with its brethren Colt 45 by Baltimore's own National Brewery in the late 19th century, Mr. Boh symbolizes the best of everything Baltimore. Unfortunately National Brewery went out of business shortly after the Second World War. 'Natty-Boh' and Colt still exist today however, brewed by Pabst Blue Ribbon. Boh is only distributed to Maryland and very limitedly to southern Pennsylvania. Continues to be the quintessential crab beer and Baltimore high school students best choice for an excellent tasting, inexpensive beer. Foreigners will never understand the significance of that little one eyed pimp on the side of the can/bottle and hopefully things will continue to be this way. Bmore what up!
