sleestak
a mythical creature from the Land of the Lost. These creatures are defined as being green in color, having large, black eyes, no fingers (thumbs and four fingers grouped as part of the hand), and webbed feet. They also emit a hissing sound when agitated. They are known to have evolved into a species that can communicate through speech. Enik was at talking version of a more evolved Sleestak Species.
