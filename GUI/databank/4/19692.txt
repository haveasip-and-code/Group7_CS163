Reba (the best rent-a-pig ever)
In a little town called owensboro, two men were at peace with all fake enforcers of the law at the 'mall'. UNTIL ONE DAY it all started. Micah and Cheeseburger knew all the security officers names except for one, and this man is satan. THUS we gave him a name we could think of. The most womanly name that came into our shallow minds. And it was Reba, thus the monster was born. Eventually getting his own arse fired. THAT DIRTY BASTARD! ; As I was walking down the street, a particular madness came about me. I no longer knew where I was, I was lost into oblivion. I became a child of the void. As I stepped through the darkness, I saw two armies clashing, I saw the bodies, they were piled on top of each other. Screaming, I fled for my life. As soon as I knew it, I was thrust into the madness of combat, swords clashing over me head, bodies dropping to the ground. I saw the blood, dear gah the blood! I was afflicted with a madness that could only be cast down upon those who entered a state of the surreal. It seemed as if everything was going in slow motion, the battle was ceasing to a halt. As soon as I knew it, I was back at my house. However, ghostly apparitions, blood red with their eyes seeping with a despair that cannot be described. I felt my hair standing on end, as if they were going to be plucked out by the air itself. I ran and I ran, passed the fleshly, horrible walls of my entrapment. I did not know what to expect next, as Micah walked out of the bathroom and kicked me off of the computer :(.
