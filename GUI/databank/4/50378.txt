Netscape
A browser that lost the browser wars to Internet Explorer long ago. The last version that wasn't over-commercialized was Netscape 4.6. The current version is 7.2, which is loaded down with a lot of AOL junk and advertizing. It is inferior to nearly all browsers on the market, except for Internet Explorer, which it is slightly better than ; Firefox>Everything Else>Netscape>Internet Explorer Shells (avent, maxthon)>Internet Explorer
