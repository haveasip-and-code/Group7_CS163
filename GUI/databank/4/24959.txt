differently abled
adj. [Politically correct] 1990s euphemism meaning '[disabled]'. Contrary to what the words may suggest, '[differently abled]' does NOT mean 'having different abilities;' more precisely it means 'lacking expected abilities.' Since mental disability is generally associated with much more social stigma than physical disability (and hence is ripe for being described by a 'sensitive' [PC] vocabulary), '[differently abled]' is most frequently encountered in similar contexts as '[special]'. With this in mind, persons of non-retarded status should construe the phrase as a deep insult.
