brooklyn Tech
Founded by Dr. Albert L. Colston, Brooklyn Technical High School is one of the three elite highschools of New York. The faculty of Brooklyn Tech has its odd balls but overall it has some of the finest teachers anywhere. Brooklyn Tech offers a vast variety of intellectually stimulating courses along with an overwhelming variety of clubs, sports and the like. The student population of Brooklyn Tech is more or less evenly spread, racially, and contains the highest concentration of the greatest young minds of New York. As a testement to this fact is its outstanding alumni, which includes the founder, owner and current CEO of Barnes and Nobel bookstore among many others. It is even said that if you go anywhere in the world wearing a Brooklyn Technical Highschool t-shirt someone will come up to talk to you (often it's to either offer a job or talk about the good ol' days). The building itself is an amazing work of art. Outside one will find carvings of owls overlooking the main entrance way, heads finely crafted lining the wall of the school, acting as guardians of a sort. Along with this the center section of the school's first floor contains an amazing mural dedicated to the achievements of mankind through labor and science. The building was crafted in the 1930s at the time of the great depression and was designed to be self sufficient in all ways. Although it may seem somewhat outdated the building of is a physical representation of the greatness that is Brooklyn Technical Highschool.
