sexurity
The struggle of many over the course of the world. Sexurity is a hybrid desire for sex and security without the associated drama. Sexurity is reached when a person can have sex with someone, have it mean something, more than nothing, and feel good about it short term and long term. Sexurity is much different than [love], bypassing the drama.
