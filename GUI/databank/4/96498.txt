Stone Cold Crazy
An all-time favorite superb frantic rocker from Queen on their third album 'Sheer Heart Attack' (1974). It was the first song written by all four members of the band after John Deacon completed their line-up in 1972. It has pounding guitars and strong vocals with some awesome energy, almost frenetic enough to be classified as proto-punk. It transcends time and genre and is by far one of the best rock songs in history that Metallica later covered and earned a Grammy award for best heavy metal performance in 1991.
