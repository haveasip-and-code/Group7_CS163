ham
Although some *cough cough nat cough cough* believe this to be part of a chicken or turkey, in reality it is part of the pig. We must look past such triffles and errors and realize that whats really important is freindship. In this busy day it is often commonplace to forget to let people know how greatful you are for them. Incase ive never expressed it before, to thou who thinks ham is turkey, thanks for being such a good freind :)
