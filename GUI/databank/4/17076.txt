Bamby
Derived from the latin root 'bambinnalino'; meaning 'torn leg-wear'. 'Bamby' is typically a term applied to [polo] trousers that have suffered large amounts of tear and wear due to harsh, often [cheap], cleaning products. Whilst there is some debate about the limited scope of applying a term to only polo [trousers], most all agree that should the term be used in regards to all leg-wear, the usage would be so frequent as to render most conversation incoherent.
