The United States Merchant marine Academy
also known as Kings Point. Its a place where one wears a silly costume (uniform), does plenty of excercise(looking at porn) and of course is well hydrated, with more alcohol than you can imagine. But what do you expect from a school full of sailors. Unlike the sissies at the Naval Academy, we know how to drink and chase women of the night. We are given a whole year to do it on commericial ships. Located in Great Neck NY we proudly display our Nazi Flagpole, in a Jewish Community. Need I say anything else about an establishment that when you graduate you are given choices to actually make a ton of money, and not have to go active duty. Because why fight in the war, when you can profit off of it.
