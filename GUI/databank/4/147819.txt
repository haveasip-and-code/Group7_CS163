The discontent with the status quo that was beginning to seethe apon college campuses drew young veterns of the civil rights struggle to a meeting in Port Huron, Michigan, in 1962. During that meeting they organized Stundents for a Democratic Society, whose soul purpose was to tear apart militarism, racial injustice, and poverty. ; New Lefists gained national attention in 1964 when administrators at the Unversity of California at Berkeley banned on-campus recruiting of civil rights workers and fund-raising for the movement. The ban ingited the FSM(Free Speech Movement), which staged protests including a massive sit-in and arrest of some 800 people. The FSM became the model for campus protest, however the the issue of free speech soon paled before a much more pressing matter of stundent concern: the Vietnam War.
