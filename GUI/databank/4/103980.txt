Ray-Tronic
An advanced transmission system from Honda. Allows quick and smooth shift from your automatic transmission with the quickness of a manual transmission. ; Explanation: Our friend has an automatic civic but he always downshifts using the 2 and L features, and acts like it is a stick car. He does it so much that one day we decided to name his driving technique as Ray-Tronic.
