backpack riding
Great game made up by 2 kids in 8th grade. One person takes his backpack off and runs across the hallway floor while dragging the backpack on the ground. The other person runs behind him and jumps onto the backpack while it's moving. While the person is in front dragging the backpack, the person on the backpack has to stay on as long as he can.
