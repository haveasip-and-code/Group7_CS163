Oriental
A quaint sailing village with a drinking problem, located in eastern North Carolina in Pamlico County on the Neuse River. Also known as O-Town, Oriental harbors more boats than people. Oriental is home to the O-Town Hustlas, and hosts such annual events as the Croaker Festival and the Tarpon Tournement. The prefered passtime in O-Town is getting fucked up.
