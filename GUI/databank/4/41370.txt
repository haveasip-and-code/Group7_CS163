monkey button
A monkey button is my term for any tool, program, script, thingamajig, that let's you essentially push a button to complete some repetitive task. Simplifying an otherwise complicated task into something any monkey can do. The ultimate monkey button is one that doesn't even require a monkey. It just runs itself, going off at some predetermined interval.
