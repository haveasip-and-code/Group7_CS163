pseudosophical
Intermingling of the Greek prefix 'pseudo' and the adjective 'philisophical', i.e. falsely philisophical. The intention of creating this word isn't applicable to criticism of philisophical arguments per se, but rather to certain scenes of bad movies or low-budget films in which the dialogue contains lines which were probably the film director's attempt at being philisophical, but is in fact unintelligible nonsense.
