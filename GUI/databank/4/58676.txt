Rockford  IL
A town in NW Illinois, consisting of about 150,000 people. In general, there is nothing to do but smoke the refer, and get drunk off our asses. Rockford is pretty much known for having an incredibly high crime rate (partially due to the high unemployment). If planning to come to Rockford, make sure u come during a good time, like the Waterfront or Wing Ding, where you can watch people of all races come together in huge gatherings of drunkeness.
