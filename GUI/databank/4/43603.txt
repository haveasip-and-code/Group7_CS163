kthx
An phrase short for 'Okay, thanks' that originated somewhere on the internet a really long time ago. A snarky, quick dismissal. The word today is now old and unfunny, and everybody who still uses it should be lined up and shot. ; [Scenester]s are obsessed with it and end practically every sentence with it. Somebody tell them to stop. For the love of God, please.
