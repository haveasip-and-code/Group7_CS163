Guild Wars
Although different in concept to other MMORPGs, Guild Wars has proved to be a creditable and righteous game for people familiar with the genre. Even newbies will find this game all sorts of fun, as it is not hard to learn the basics of the game. ; The main jobs available thus far are: ; Warrior ; Necromancer ; Elementalist ; Ranger ; Monk ; Mesmer ; You can combine to have any one as a primary/secondary job and get attributes from both (but only the special attribute of your primary job). ; Quests are a lot of fun and the graphics are a delight. ; I've been malspending my money playing [FFXI], a game in which you payed a monthly fee and you had so much of a hard time getting Gil (FFXI currency) that 90% of the people actually buy it online... This sort of nonsense is not seen in Guild Wars. Get this game if you're a fan of the likes of [World of Warcraft].
