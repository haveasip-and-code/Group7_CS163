swingling
Swingling, an art form thought lost in the sands of time, was recently rediscovered alive and well on the upper East Side of NYC, thriving in the brain of The Swingler. Last practiced during the renaissance, Swingling is a delicate ballet of words that leaps to a new height with every more obscure reference. A master of Swingling is able to confound everyone in the room by making references to arcane subjects like rauchbier & bovine fistulation.
