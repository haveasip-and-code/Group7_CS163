braces
It's a normal, calm day until you visit the dentist. They give you the horrible news- you need braces. First you have to put these little things in between your teeth. Then you have to take mold and x-rays and get on these little metal torture devices, hand made by Satan and shipped from hell itself. After two years of them being tightened and getting screamed at by your orthodonist (unless you get a not demon-possessed one), you get them off. 'YAY!' you think, until they hand you your retainer, which is a pain to make sure you don't lose it whe you take it off to eat and you have to make sure to wear it or else it won't fit anymore. In short, braces are the worse things I've ever had the displeasure to wear.
