history
something that somepeople find hard to beilieve in for we were never there how can we be sure it happened, for all we know the world that we live in, or better yet, the reality could be in a farce, a lie and perhaps weve been mind-fucked for an experiment and that everything has been a result of years of careful planning made by one super-power, but maybe power has nothing to do with it and that bussiness itself exists within our reality and not theirs, or prehaps on account to what daniel quinn was saying for all those years, perhaps its mother culture who produces the theories and the consiricy ideas to make us forget, maybe history did happen but people who 'try to look at it in a different way' are the ones with the second hidden agenda, perhaps we'll never know
