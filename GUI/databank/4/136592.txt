Free Samples
The best thing ever. Mostly found in grocery stores or malls, usually food. But at this one place I can't get any free stuff because the person at the counter says I need to be 18 or with an adult. What the fuck? I need to be 18 to eat a fucking cookie? Bullshit. ; Sometimes it can be other stuff, like complimentary items in hotel rooms.
