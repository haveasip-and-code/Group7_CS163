tears in heaven
Eric Clapton was inspired to write this because his son fell out the window from his 52 story apartment building in New York City. The loss of Conor, Eric's only son. As it turned out, this was Eric's best selling album since the Cream days. To this day it has sold more than 7 million copies in US only. Mostly because of the monster hit Tears In Heaven.
