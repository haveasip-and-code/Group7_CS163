saiyuki
An anime version of the famous chinese novel 'Journey to the West' (AKA 'Monkey King') with a big twist! Created by Minekura Kazuya, [Saiyuki] is about four guys- a monk with a gun, a sexy perverted kappa, an 18 year old kid with a bottomless stomach, and a human turned demon with the most sweetest smile, travelling to the west to place called Tenjiku, to stop the revival test of Gyumao, performed by his crazy wife, in order to conquer the world. During their journeys, they encounter demons, gods, assasins and worst of all, their past. ; Not to forget their daily routine of Gojyo and [Goku] fighting, [Gojyo] picking girls, the guys drinking [sake] and play mahjoong and kicking demons butt! ; It's a mix of humour, action, bloodspill, couple of bad words(not really), some scenes of [yaoi](it's not, but some fans say it is!) but nonetheless, it's a great [anime] and it's really addicting!
