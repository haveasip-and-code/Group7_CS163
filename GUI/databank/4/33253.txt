G-Spot
The G-Spot is no longer just a term you learn about on the Sunday Night Sex Show with Sue Johanson, its a location in central North Carolina. Though some call it just Greensboro, or The 'Boro, it is also called The G-Spot. The G-Spot can also be used as a name for Grimsley High School, which is a shitty high school that lots of rich white kids go to.
