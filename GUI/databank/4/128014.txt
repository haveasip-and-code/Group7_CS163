Hindu rebuild
A luxury or exotic car, that was salvaged at an insurance auction; then aesthetically repaired, repainted, fitted with [mags], then sold to an unlucky buyer. On the Westcoast, mechanics and bodyshop owners of Indian decent are notorious for creating and selling such vehicles. Hindu rebuilds often have rolled back odometers, crooked frames, and mechanical problems; and are charaterized by having a brand new paint job that doesn't match the manufacturers specifications.
