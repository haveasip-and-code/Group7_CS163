Youngstown
Oddly enough, my favorite place to go. Since where I live is too boring and my parents grew up there so I've always gotten to go there all the time so it's like a second home. It's interesting enough if you're hanging out in the park: Lots of gunshots, people threatening to kill you, druggies, and male prostitutes. (But not everywhere in Youngstown, only the fun parts.)
