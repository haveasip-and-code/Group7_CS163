Scotty Principle
(n.) The defacto gold star standard for delivering products and/or services within a projected timeframe. Derived from the original [Star Trek] series wherein Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott consistently made the seemingly impossible happen just in time to save the crew of the [Enterprise] from disaster. ; The premise is simple: ; 1) Caluculate average required time for completion of given task. ; 2) Depending on importance of task, add 25-50% additional time to original estimate. ; 3) Report and commit to inflated time estimate with superiors, clients, etc. ; 4) Under optimal conditions the task is completed closer to the original time estimate vs. the inflated delivery time expected by those waiting.
