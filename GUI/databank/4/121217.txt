Holy Name
Probably the most liberal of the assorted private and parochial schools in Berks County. Holy Name's student body may not be as racially diverse as other schools, but the students tend to be very open to those different from them, especially when it comes to upperclassmen (i.e. laxers hang out with art kids during frees). ; The school itself is a kind of place where it is really up to a student whether or not he/she wants to be challenged. The school environment is very much centered on the humanities, and graduates from Holy Name are usually accepted into the best colleges. ; Many of Holy Name's students and alumni come from a wide array of different, yet prestigious, towns such as Wyomissing, Gladwyne, and Green Hills. This particular high school also happens to have a high number of students who come from wealthy, [W.A.S.P.]y families, resulting in jealousy and rivalry from other local private schools. ; You know you see a Holy Name girl if... ; 1.)
