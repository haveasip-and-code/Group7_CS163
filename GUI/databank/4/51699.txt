Hula Popper
A Hula Popper is a ridiculous fishing lure that is mentioned ONLY by country music singers and the occaisional country music singer wannabe..and texans. It's a flipping lure. We refer this definition to Brad Paisley's song 'Ain't Nothin' Like'. ; His song is a prime example of why people whose names sound like a yogurt/cereal should not be in the country music business. Not any music business for that matter. Not anywhere at all.
