Greg The Bunny
One of the most brilliant TV shows in world history, a show that only a true hipster can appreciate. It is about a world where puppets and humans coexist on the set of 'Sweetknuckle Junction', a failing children's educational show. Some of the best characters are Count Blah, the vampire with the hilarious verbal tic, and Warren Demontague, the dramatic monkey with a football helmet and a ripe additude. On a sad note, this show was canceled because FOX couldn't stand how witty it was, but the 2-disc set (which came out on my birthday) is phenomenal, yet short.
