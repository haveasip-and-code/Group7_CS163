Voldermort
A misspelling of 'Voldemort'. [Voldemort] is the primary villain in the Harry Potter series. ; Some fans of the books tend to insert the additional 'R' often, probably because of its location on the keyboard next to 'E'. This frequent error is terribly irritating to certain pedantic HP fans; the resulting situation is terribly funny to relatively average fans like me.
