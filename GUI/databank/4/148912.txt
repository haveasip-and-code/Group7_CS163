Topper Headon
Topper Headon was the drummer for The Clash. His real name is Nicky Headon. He had tried out for Mick ; s band,the London S.S.,then something happened,and tada,he was in The Clash. He later got kicked out though because he had a drug addiction and was becoming unreliable. I believe he released a solo album too. He was really short,and also sometimes had to wear women's shoes,because his feet were so small. He also got married to his girlfriend Wendy,but they divorced.
