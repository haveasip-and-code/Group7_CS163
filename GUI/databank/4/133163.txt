LOUISIANA
I'm from LOUISIANA. ; We're as deep south as they come and we have the funniest accent you've ever heard, but you love it. ; We shouldnt even qualify as the south because when you come here, you enter another country. When you ask for a coke we ask 'what kind?' and its not a sub or a hoagie, its a po-boy. Our beaches are contaminated and there are 8 different pronunciations of the word 'water.' Its New Orleans not 'New Orleeens' and we use north and south to tell directions, not left and right. No one knows how to use a blinker, and you can't make a left turn anywhere in the city. We love our LSU tigers although there are still some Tulane fans, and Skip Bertman will ALWAYS be our baseball coach, no matter if he's dead or alive. We shoot firecrackers when they say 'the rockets red glare' in the National Anthem and the Saints will always be our team (even when they win the super bowl...we'll complain about how long it took). I don't care where you live, you can't beat our seafood (especially the crawfish) and nothing is good without a little tony cacheries on it. I'm from LOUISIANA and no matter if our schools are failing, our politics are dirty, and our biggest city is underwater, there AIN'T no place like home!
