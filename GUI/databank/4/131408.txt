taxi ride
When you take a girl home after a night out to do a bit of the horizontal shuffle and in a moment of painful sobriety you realise you've pulled a whale. Realising you need to get this mammoth out of the house before your mates see her you stop riding her and call her a taxi home. Like most taxi-rides the money you pay is rarely worth it.
