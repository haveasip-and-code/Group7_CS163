Mike Richter
The Best NHL hockey Goalie to ever play the sport. Despite injuries and bad misfortune Mike Richter had more agility and flexablity then any goalie. Most consistant incredible play game in and game out despite that the team in front of him was horrible defensively. Mike Ritcher stood on his head ever time he played. New York Rangers won the cup in 94 because they had a good team, but it was all Mike Richter. If the Rangers would have had just decent teams these past years they would have won more cups with Richter in net.
