Vallejo
Also known as The Block, Vallejo is the biggest city in Solano County. Consisting of: [The Crest] ([Cuddiville]), Terrace Park, [T.T. West] (Tree Town), The Ville, Hillcrest, Beverly Hills, Rancho, Lofas, The South, College Park, The Hills, Simmerons (Good Crest and Sea Side, Vallejo is a influencial part of the North Bay and Greater East Bay. With a populaiton of just over 121,000 people, Vallejo has become concentrated with city blocks of clicks and hence has become to be known as The Block. Surrounded by wankster cities like Benicia, Fairfield, American Canyon, Napa and Vacaville, Vallejo has maintained its reputation, as Dave Chappell would say, of keepn' it real. On the news you usually hear about Oakland, Richmond and SF crimes and whatnot but you never hear about Vallejo. That because '[ya boys]' tryna run this city and cover things from the media. But please believe, on The Block, mess goes down. Triflin drama in dis city. Authorities here is corrupt.
