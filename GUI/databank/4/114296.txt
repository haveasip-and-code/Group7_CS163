Elfen Lied
An ultra-violent science fiction anime involving human mutants called 'dicloniuses'; females sport purple hair and horns which resemble pointy ears, and males which have horns and posess no telekinetic powers. The mutants kill humans and each other using 'vectors' (invisible 'arms' of telekinetic force) that can stretch and easily slice through light objects, and their tendency for violence varies amongst characters. The story also deals with the issues of psychological trauma and repressed memories, as well as moral insanity (particularly dysocial psychopathy) as a result of absent unconditional, parental love. The main diclonius character, Lucy, has a split personality, one of them infantile Nyu, and the other the resentful, solemn , and murderous Lucy. ; Though praised by many as unique, the series itself is nauseating to watch as the constant themes of senseless tragedy, psychological and physical brutality, and resolve, do little to endear the characters to viewers. Elfen Lied can be best summarized as an exploitation project involving cliche anime characters than anything else; the art style is redundant, with logical errors and contradictions abounding in the story and character development.
