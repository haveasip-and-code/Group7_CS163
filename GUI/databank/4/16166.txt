Planetside
A MMoFPS or Massivly Multiplayer Online First person shooter. *phew* ; Basically, the concept is to use tactics to take control of the planet of Auraxis. You choose which Empire out of three to join. ; Terran Republic: We blow shit up. (Inaccurate but fast rate of fire weaponry) ; New Conglomerate: Vive la rebellion. (Powerful weaponry but innacurate and not as fast as TR) ; Vanu Soverignty: Pzzzaappp! (Laser weaponry, 'nuff said). ; www.planetside.com
