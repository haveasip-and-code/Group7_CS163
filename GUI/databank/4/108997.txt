ninja toe
Male version of the female [camel toe]. Ninja toe forms in the groin area of men who wear pants or jeans that are too tight. The result is similar to the booties ninjas wear where the toes are split into one group of 2 and one group of 3. [Camel toe] is divided equally whereas the male anatomy forces an extra toe to either side-thus ninja toe.
