h.o.t
one would refer to something as 'h.o.t' if it is cool or interesting. can also be used to describe someone who is extremely good looking such as Minwoo or Tony An. ; must be said using a pause between each letter: H-O-T so not to confuse the word with 'hot' which has a similar meaning but is definately not as cool to use in a social situation.
