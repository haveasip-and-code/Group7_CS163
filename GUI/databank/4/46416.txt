Full metal Alchemist
It's actually spelt 'Fullmetal Alchemist', but... It's about a boy named Edward Eric who loses his arm and leg while his brother loses his body and gets his soul stuck in a piece of armor. ; They then travel to try and find the Philoshiphor's stone. ; Extra note: I can spell 'Inuyasha' fine. I'm a fan of both series. And I tell you now, stop fighting! Look, none of the plot is better than the other! One's trying to find jewel shards, the other trying to find a stone! They've both got great plot, great characters, great humor. So just... stop it. And try to enjoy both series without comparing or muttering about how one of them sucks because thatjust ruins the experience.
