S10
A friggin awesome minitruck made by [Chevrolet], greatest car company on earth, from 1982 onward. The first generation S10s were produced relatively unchanged from 1982-1993. Second gen S10s lasted from 1994-1997, and the new bodystyle (Still in production) has lasted from 1998. ; S10s are very popular. They are amazingly cheap to buy and customize, and just as many have been lowered to the ground as have been thrusted into the sky on knobbly offroad tires. I happen to own one, it is the sex. S10s are popular recipients of engine swaps, where one removes the stock [4 banger] or 6 cylinder and installs a V8. (Usually a 305 cubic inch, though the more adventurous install 350s, and i've even seen a 454 stuffed into one. You can find many modified into drag racers, rock crawlers, and lowriders, and the good old fashioned rusted-through work trucks are everywhere. Everyone loves the Chevrolet S10. ; My particular example is a 1985. It is black with dual white racing stripes on the hood (aftermarket cowl hood, btw), a now out of production full Stillen [body kit], a vinyl bedcover, a 305ci V8, Pioneer CD player, and two 8' [subs] behind the bench seat. ; Of course, the ignorant assholes out there will see the words 'body kit' and do something along the lines of 'OMFG! Posermotherfucka trying to rice out an S10!'. I feel i should elaborate. My truck is very much American muscle - the 305ci V8 i have already mentioned breathes through dual straight pipes all the way back with dual Flowmasters filtering it all. No fart-can exhaust on this, it's more like a Chevelle with a bed, 'cept not an El Camino, 'cause it doesn't suck.
