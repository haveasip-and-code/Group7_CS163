Gear Aquisition Syndrome
Also known as G.A.S. ; This condition afflicts musicians and singers of all kinds, but seems to be especially virulent in electric guitar players. It is typified by an uncontrollable urge to buy, beg, borrow or steal the latest piece of musical equipment seen in a store, in a magazine, on TV or on another musician. ; Poverty is the only known prevention (and only known cure) for the disease.
