ipod mini
A great idea by Apple, the 4 GB model holds around 1,000 songs, MUCH more practical than the models that hold over 10,000 songs (see [iPod]) because the battery won't be alive long enough for you you to even hear half of the songs on them. iPod mini comes in five colors; pink, green, blue, silver, and gold. Small, lightweight and very portable. The only reason you're even looking this up is because A) You've been living under a rock for the past year or two or B) You can't afford one or were stupid enough to slam it onto the ground until it broke, so you seek comfort in seeing other people's hate definitions.
