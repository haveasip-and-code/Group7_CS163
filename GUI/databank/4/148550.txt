St.Anger
St. Anger is Metallica's eighth full-length studio album. The album was to be released on June 10, 2003, but because of fears of extended music piracy over filesharing networks, St. Anger was released 5 days earlier on June 5, 2003. ; Six years elapsed between the release of the band's previous studio album, Reload, and the recording of St. Anger, which began in 2002. Many factors contributed to this delay, the two most important being the departure of bassist Jason Newsted, and vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield's several months in rehab.
