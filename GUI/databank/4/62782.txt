mensa
Sheesh Ninja Disaster, you have to do some research before blasting Mensa members like that. ; True: Mensa is an organization for people with high IQs. Their requirement for entry is that their potential members must score within the top 2% in their standardized intelligence test. ; False: Unlike some people would have you believe not all Mensa members are snobbish assholes. Also, their meetings are not just about academic endeavors . Many of them know that being extremely intelligent can be socially awkward so their meetings are a chance for these members meet other socially awkard intelligent people and do normal everyday things that regular 'Schmoes' like you and I would do.
