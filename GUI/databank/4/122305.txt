drop bear
A native to the australian outback, the drop bear is a mysterious, yet chillingly savage member of the marsupial family. If you are unlucky enough to pitch a tent under a tree inhabited by a drop bear, and rouse it from it's slumber, be prepared for pain country! It will drop from the tree, latching onto your face (a la the facehugger from the alien)and proceeds to rid you of any good looks you may (or may not) have once had. ; Only known deterrant is a generous smearing of vegemite behind the ears. It saved me once and I'd do it again in a heartbeat!
