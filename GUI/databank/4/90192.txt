shinobi
in the old days, pre 3d, a video game character so hard he could beat a tag team master chief, solid snake, jason bourne, and the entire delta squad from republic commando. a ninja with a cool ass sword and an infinite supply of shurikens, sometimes confused with ninja gaiden, who was his SNES equivalent.
