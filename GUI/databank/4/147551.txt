Big Daddy Kane
Birth Name: Antonio Hardy ; Member of what some may consider to be hip hop's first super group: The Juice Crew. ; Kane was regarded as one of the best in his era because of his lyrical ability (similes, metaphors, delivery, etc. for you commercial fans)and spoken of in the same breath as greats such as Rakim and KRS-One. He achieved moderate crossover success but floundered when he attempted to incorporate more of an R&B flavor into his music (I.E. LL) and posed with Madonna. His album Looks Like a Job For... was a return to his hardcore hip hop roots but was seemingly overlooked. He was last rumored to be working on an album which would be executive produced by Alchemist. Hopefully he will also contact Pete Rock, Premier, Marley, and Large Professor to create another classic to shut the mouths of every wack m.c. polluting Billboard's top 10.
