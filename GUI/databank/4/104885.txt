bathtub
An ugly boat. Looks like a floating bathtub due to a large ammount of free board. They are noted for their tsunami sized wakes and algae scum lines which resemble soap scum lines on an old wash tub. ; Refers to the old freestanding type bathtubs that look like giant oval shaped bowls in the corner of the bathroom. Bathtub type boats appear to sit on top of the water just like bath basins sit atop the floor in a bathroom. ; Refers to 99% new boats on the water today. Purchased by suburban yups that know nothing about boats. Such boat buyers tend to equate boat size with boat quality and consequently buy the cheapest, biggest barge that they can locate.
