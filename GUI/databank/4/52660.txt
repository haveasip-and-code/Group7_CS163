A website, once heralded for its great comics. Now a refuge for the scum of the internet. A gathering ground of faggotry at its lowest. A bastion of internet tough guys. Nerds who want to talk politics, porn, games or other things. The scum reside in the forum section known as 'today's mayhem', but are known to leak out into the other sections as well. ; Any member number that goes into 5 digit numbers is considered a noobie, and will generally never find acceptance within the forum. In fact, anyone over 4000 is a noob in my book. The rot in the forum started around 2000.
