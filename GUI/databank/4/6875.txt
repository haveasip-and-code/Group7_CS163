Trinity at Meadow View
A shack on a hill. A school in Falls Church, Virginia. Co-ed, small, christian. Small variety of sports, small variety of guys, and girls. Strict as hell, very isolated. Full of prudes and Religion obsessors. Just sucks nuts. ; Tip: Don't go there. Ever. It will ruin your high school experience.
