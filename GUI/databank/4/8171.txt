Biggie Smalls
Argueably (and in my opinion) the best mc/rapper to ever grace the mic. ; Tupac has nothing on some of his songs (no disrespect intended, 2 Pac is the second best rapper :P ), no matter how fat he was, he still rocked. ; RIP ; P.S Can everyone stop disrespecting him please, hes dead, so what if hes fat etc. Tupac dissed him because he thought he was involved (didnt tell him about) in the new york shooting and robbery incident. Either way, its Tupacs beef not yours, so shut up and listen to Ready to Die or Life After Death (fuck Born Again) and realise how great this man really was. ; R.I.P Christoper Wallace, The Greatest.
