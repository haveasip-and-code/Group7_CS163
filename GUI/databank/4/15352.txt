photoshop tennis
A game originally created by Coudal Partners where two opponents pass an image back and forth editing the image with [Photoshop] (other layered image editing programs such as the [GIMP] can be used), in an attempt to creatively out maneuver their opponent. A judge or judging panel is usually decided before the match begins to decide the winner. Matches usually last ten rounds.
