Mormon Murders  The
A book by the same title. A true story of the police investigation of Mark Hoffman, a bomb murderer and professional forgerer and member of the Mormon Church. Hoffman entertained himself by finding documents to embarass the Morman Church and nearly exposed the vast Mormon enterprise for the fraud that it is. This book explains in great detail the involvement of church hierarchy in this cover up.
