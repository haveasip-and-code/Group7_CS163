hoodie
a sweatshirt with a hood and a big 'kangaroo' pocket in front. you can just about always find one at university book shops with the college's name on the front. available at tourist shops, too. (gift shops in general) never leave the house without one, even in two-hundred degree weather. if you can't bear to wear it anymore, tie it around your waist.
