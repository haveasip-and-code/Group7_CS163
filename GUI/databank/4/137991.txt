gattonite
Technically, anyone with the misfortune to be dwelling in the evolutionary mudtrap that is the small town of Gatton, Queensland. More often, however, it is used to specifically refer to the semi-sentient native dwellers of this town, rather than those who have moved there within the last couple of generations. The former species are, almost without exception, inbred, ignorant, and utterly incapable of comprehending anything beyond their tiny, potato farming existance. ; See also [bogan]
