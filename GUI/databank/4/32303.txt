Aquinite
A term used to identify someone who is a student and/or fanatic believer in the philosophy of Aquinas Academy, a poorly-run school located in Bear, DE. Often used as an insult or a very negative term, although many students consider it a matter of pride to be called an Aquinite, these students are not known to be very bright.
