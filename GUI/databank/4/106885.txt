Sweddy
The origin of the word comes from an insult given to people that are into GOOD music e.g rock, metal, punk etc, by chavs, scallies, and townies. The majority of chavs came up with the name after they decided they were too stupid to come up with something clever and witty. They came up with sweddy which stands for Smoke Weed Every Day. Now the brain dead chavs have stuck with the name and get some sort of kick out of calling random 'sweddies' in the streets, whom they have no relation to whatsoever. Smoking weed every day is not common with 'sweddies' but mostly common with chavs. Ironic isn't it?
