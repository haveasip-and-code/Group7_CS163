mowatt
Penis. Euphemistic term in honor of tight-end Zeke Mowatt, late of the New England Patiots and New York Giants, who famously shook his member at a female reporter, Lisa Olson, who had gained entrance to the Patriots' lockerroom in 1991. A media firestorm and sexual harassment lawsuit ensued and Zeke's place in [lustmolch] history was established.
