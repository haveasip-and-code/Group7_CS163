My second favorite beer next to Pabst Blue Ribbion (Dont make fun of my taste in beer, at least I dont drink coors). Its a smoooth tasting extra Pale lager that even people who hate beer (girls) can enjoy. It was probably made famous by the movie 'the Deer Hunter,' Cause its the only beer Robert De Niro drank in that film.
