fault line
Used in the lyrics in the song called The Outsider from A Perfect Circle. Deal with a problem or fault without do something drastic. Cope with it and move on. To be aware of a problem that can not be fixed but tuck away deep inside yourself, a place like the intersection of a geologic fault with the surface of the earth or other plane of reference.
