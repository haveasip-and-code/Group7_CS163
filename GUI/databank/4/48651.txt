Bass
'Back ass' A continuation of the gluteal cheeks up the back of 'the larger lady' so that the feminine crack ends up half way up the back, sometimes to shoulder blade level, resulting in what looks like butt cheeks that go all the way up. Often, bass can be seen poking out the top of leggings, when worn with a boob tube. Bass often goes hand in hand with [fupa].
