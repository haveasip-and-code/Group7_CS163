suburbumpkin
This is a person who lives in the suburbs and rarely comes downtown, but has decided to do so, and is now making a mess of traffic. They typically look quite confused as they try to comprehend the usefulness of one-way streets. They can also look and a little scared as they grip their purses and eye the non-caucasians over their shoulders. They drive like out-of-towner idiots.
