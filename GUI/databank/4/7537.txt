objectivitism
Alteration of [objectivism]. ; This word originated in 1999 on a free ProBoards forum when some diehard [randroid] came and put a quote relating to Objectivism in her signature. This caused ads for Objectivist dating/sportswear/etc. to appear on every thread---the administrator quickly added 'objectivism' to the censored word list and made it so every time she used this word it would become 'objectivitism.' ; Since then, the word has come into widespread use in our community and probably others as well; where I live, you frequently hear people referring to 'objectivitism' or 'objectivitists' when referring to Ayn Rand's philosophy or her followers, respectively.
