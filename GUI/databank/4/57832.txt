Needham
Needham is a town southwest of Boston with about 1 bank per household. Its teenage population consists of mostly burnouts, rich chicks and jocks. Needham is so boring that the cops don't have anything better to put in the police blotter than 'Baked Goods Mistaken For Weapons' and 'Truck Backs Into Gift Shop.'
