leprosy
A disease that I seem to think everyone has. Characterized by skin lesions and necrosis, it is decease that is fairly rare, and horribly terrifying, yet funny to laugh at. For instance the suggestion that something is leprosy that isn't. For instance someone coughs, they are said to be coming down with leprosy, or if someone looks old, well, then they must have leprosy. When the leaves fall off the trees it can be attributed to leprosy, rather than the changing of the seasons.
