North Harford High school
Kids from North Harford are good kids. They aren't brats like people from [Fallston]. They work hard for what they want, they dont get everything handed to them on a platter from Mom and Dad. There are the typical clicks and groups, but everyone gets along because they don't think that they are better than everyone.
