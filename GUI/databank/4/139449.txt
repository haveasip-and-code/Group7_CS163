Seriously
Seriosky actully means: 'Am lying', and you Know it' ; This comes from all the politicians, crooks and others who have used the word 'seriously' when they were actually lying, e.g: 'Seriously, am Innocent-Robert Blake','Seriously, am innocent-Martha Stuart','seriously, am straight'-Ryan Seacrest
