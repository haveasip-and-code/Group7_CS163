The super duper chocolate bowl
The super duper chocolate bowl is a phenomenon that happens when you mix together everything made of chocolate that you own(this includes hot chocolate mixes, chocolate cereal, chocolate chips, chocolate milk, chocolate sauce, etc.) and then eat it out of a huge bowl with a nice shiny spoon and milk...don't forget the milk.
