Chav Circles
A strange urban mystery, found in many places such as car parks, recreational parks and sometimes outside local parades of shops. ; The chav circle is a modern day phenomenon, the city dwellers of the early 21st century first reported the sightings just after the new millenium when the 'Chav' was a fast growing social group gaining popularity. ; Some believe that the circles are in fact left by Chavs after a night out, thought to have been made using motorised veichles with two wheels, like a moped, scooter, or as some of the older chavs prefer to use, a motorcycle.
