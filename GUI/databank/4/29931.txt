Silent Hill
Possibly the best game series ever made. With complex, intricate, psychologicaly challenging story-lines, creepy, melancholic environments, in game characters with life-like traits and emotions, and a stunningly beautiful, not to mention, very desolate soundtrack that will leave you speachless.
