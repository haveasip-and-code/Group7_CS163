Gandon
(Pronounced: 'Gun-donn') ; A not-so-common distortion of the word 'Condom', a distortion which originates in Russian slang. However, this word has nothing to do with condoms, for it simply describes a stupid person, or one who is inclined to act stupidly. ; This word, just like [Blatt], becomes increasingly popular in Hebrew slang, due to the last waves of Russian immigration to Israel in recent years.
