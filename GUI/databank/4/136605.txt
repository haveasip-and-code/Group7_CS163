kchan
(kay-chan) ; A representation of a diseased phallus. ; Coined in the 17th century by a Chinese philosopher Wang-Kock, the Kchan was an illustrious example of what a penis shouldn't be. It was the metaphorical symbol used to indirectly describe a lack of manhood, a huge degree of promiscuity, and an unfortunate creation of evolution gone wrong. ; It is now used to describe someone or something who most likely has a diseased phallus.
