cheekage leakage
Made popular in the 70's and 80's, 'cheekage leakage' refers to female ass cheeks protuding from the bottom of small, tight shorts. Originally this was purposeful (as was long feathered hair, [camel toes], and braless [terry cloth] tube tops). Sometimes abbreviated to the more British 'cheekage'.
