technical
A GLA (Global Liberation Army) owned vehicle in Command and Conquer (Zero Hour). It has a mounted machine gun on the back of the vehicle. The technical can upgrade its weaponry by salvaging enemy parts and by purchasing armor piercing bullets at the black market. It can also hold up to 5 troops, making it an effective transport vehicle. However, unlike the USA Humvee, the troops cannot fire out of the vehicle while they are inside. They must be evacuated before they can fire upon enemy units. RTS pro gamers use this versatile vehicle to pwn noobs because we pro gamers got the micro.
