Pole
1. A long poking device. Often used to poke sleeping people, usually waking them up, pissing them off and ultimatley poking an eye out. ; 2. Someone who is so thin they look like a pole. Often they can be used to poke people. Although this hurts the pole it is extremely funny to watch the victims reaction when they realise what they are being poked by. ; 3. A electric stick with which you poke sleeping Hobos and Bums and tell them to 'get the hell outta here!'
