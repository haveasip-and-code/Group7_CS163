dwaf
Dwaves are the worst enemies to the gnomes of the Gnomish Nation. They resemble orange gnomes with red eyes that know even less than gnomes and are even more destructive. They come from the mountainous mining fortress of Ksifnivek. The word came to be when someone I know who always mispronounces Rs tried to call me a dwarf.
