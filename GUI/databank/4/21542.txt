engineer
1. Usually a person that studies engineering and works in the field after graduating. ; 2. Can usually have a very strange, peculiar personality, usually because of pushy parents who stressed them to become engineers. 75% of the time, the parents aren't even engineers or smart, they just want their kids to do what they couldn't do. ; 3. Can be very intelligent, or in many cases, very arrogant people. Will not only claim to know everything about engineering, but also about the government, medicine, even professional sports. However, while you can't beat them at engineering knowledge, do stand up to them when they claim to know more about something you know a lot about. Sadly enough, many engineers have an ego.
