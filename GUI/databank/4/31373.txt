Murderous Scantrons
The Murderous Scantrons, formed in 2005 at Los Banos High School in Los Banos, California, is one of the best known bands in the world. They've been serving up smiles for forty years in Los Banos, only recently, in 2004, moved onward in their conquest for fame and fortune. The band contains three members: David, Kyle, and Morgan (sp). Their first album, 'This album is blank on purpose.', is due out in stores in July, 1999, after repeated delays due to the stealing of the source code and JAVA script by the local math teacher, Mr.Miller. The Murderous Scantrons' next show is tonight at 2A.M., in room 524 of the Los Banos High School . Be there or be squared. Don't worry, the show is blank on purpose.
