pony sauce
pony sauce is the secretion from a newt, causing you to trip really hard. it originates from a man who was stuck in the desert and was only eating lizards. he then began to trip and somehow wandered back to his home. when his kids asked him what was wrong he said, 'never eat the PONY SAUCE.'
