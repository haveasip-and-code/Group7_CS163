RGX is the Trash Can where all the Blizzhackers Banned junk ends up in. You may think of RGX as the big failing recycling facilty for BH users that has bankrupt 4 times already. By Script Kiddies. ; Wether it's the extremely crappy management, that repeadetly gets replaced, wether it's the crappy spamming users (I.E. [davo818]), or is it the forum getting hacked every 40 minutes, I think we can all conclude that RGX is nothing but another lousy attempt of creating the 'next' BH. Although better than meetthe1337, a forum that all the junk that didn't survive RGX's loose moderation ends up in, and believe me, it can get quite stinky in there.
