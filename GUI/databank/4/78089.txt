Joe Montana
Clearly the most over-rated quarterback in NFL history. Truth be told that his SuperBowl appearances and victories would have never happened if he no defense, no running game and no Jerry Rice. Without these he would have been a less than average quarterback. I just wonder what he would have accomplished with a bad defense and non-existant running game like Dan Marino had.
