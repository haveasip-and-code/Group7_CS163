51 percent
A reference to conservatives or [Republicans], which alludes to the 2004 elections, in which 51 percent of the nation elected [George Bush]. Ironically many of those middle and lower class rural people who voted for him stand to lose money and other benefits as a result of his new Social Security plan.
