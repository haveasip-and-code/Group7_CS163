compensator truck
Large pickup trucks ,usually driven by [rednecks], typically jacked up with knobby off-road tires despite being too large and heavy to go off-roading with. They may also have an extended cab with a diamond-plate toolbox in the bed, which is perfectly unscratched from not having been used ever. Possibly a pair of cast-aluminum balls hang from the trailer hitch, which may be replaced with a Ford/Chevy/Dodge logo. Common wisdom holds that these trucks are used to make up for what their owners lack in stature, or other parts of the anatomy.
