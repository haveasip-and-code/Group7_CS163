the Voice
A term that Alan Rickman fans use to refer to him. Rickman, known most famously for his role as Professor Snape in the Harry Potter movies, posesses a voice that has been described variously as: melancholy, seductive, disdainful, languid, honeyed, and velvet baritone. ; This nickname is also reinforced by Rickman having played the role of Metatron in the movie 'Dogma'. Metatron was known as 'The Voice of God.'
