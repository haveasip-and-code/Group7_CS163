speed team
Not to be confused with the [lightning rod], and usually involving more than one other car, a speed team is a group of drivers who speed on the left lane of the [highway] during long road trips. Usually hardened [road warrior]s will know that the more cars that are speeding together, the less likely a [state police] car will pull them over, as long as they are going at a reasonable speed (80 on a 65 posted). ; Called a 'team' because, if a slower [float] is in the left lane, they'll often all pass it on the right together. Speed teammates rarely even know each other, and more often than not the team will eventually break up when one leaves the highway.
