quone
A neologism coined in 'The [Stakeout]' episode of the television series '[Seinfeld]', 'quone' was a word used by Mrs. Seinfeld in a [Scrabble] game. It was found by Jerry to not be a real word, but [Kramer] insists that it means 'to [sedate]'. Whether or not this word has been adapted remains to be seen.
