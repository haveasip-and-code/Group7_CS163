A hard candy that is rarely found anymore. It consisted of a hard shell similar to a lollipop but the inside was filled with some sort of chemical material...i think the same kind of material used to make model volcanoes explode in science proects in Jr. High. Anyway, the end result was that once bitten into, the child experienced a serious fizzing sensation and appeared to be rabid for a few seconds. I believe that along with Pop Rocks, there were many urban myths regarding deaths cause by swallowing these while drinking a Coke.
