Street Creed
Going down the streets healing lepars, raising the dead, and turning rock ballads into awesome! ; Street Creed allows you to feed an entire audience with one riff (played over and over again, accompanied by high-strung, over-wrought vocals) ; People with Street Creed are often seen praying before concerts, wearing tight leather pants, writing cliche lyrics, and grabbing oneself out of the water during a deluge in music videos.
