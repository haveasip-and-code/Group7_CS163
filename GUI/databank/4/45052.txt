wastelands
a Detroit original: the stripmall infested corporate diamond mines, geographically located just outside of the city boundaries, otherwise known as the SUBURBS. The first part of name describes the area's contributions to it's parental city's resources. The second part of the word is just ironic. Also the home of the WASTE-OID.
