pickaninnies
The picaninny (It is also spelled pickaninny and piccaninny) was the dominant racial caricature of Black children for most of this country's history. They were 'child coons,' miniature versions of Stepin Fetchit. Picaninnies had bulging eyes, unkempt hair, red lips, and wide mouths into which they stuffed huge slices of watermelon. They were themselves tasty morsels for alligators. They were routinely shown on postcards, posters, and other ephemera being chased or eaten. Picaninnies were portrayed as nameless, shiftless natural buffoons running from alligators and toward fried chicken. ; Source: Dr. David Pilgrim, Professor of Sociology ; Ferris State University
