champloo
Probably best known in the popular anime series 'Samurai Champloo,' the actual word champloo means blend. 'Samurai Champloo' is thus named because it is a blend of traditional japanese culture with a particularly funky hip-hop motif. The final product is one that somehow works albiet strange to first time viewers.
