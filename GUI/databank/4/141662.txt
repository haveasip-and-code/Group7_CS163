Ulster fry
One of [Ulster]'s ([Northern Ireland])most famous dishes embracing the best of local produce - bacon, sausages, eggs and breads. Primarily a breakfast dish but popular at any time of day with a few additions like chops, steak, kidneys, liver, tomatoes and mushrooms. ; What makes the Ulster fry distinctive from any other [fry-up] is the addition of farls, potato cakes and usually a scotch pancake, therefore much more emphasis on carbohydrates. ; A typical fry for one person will consist of: ; 2 sausages ; 2 bacon rashers ; 2 slices black or white pudding ; 1/2 farl and/or soda bread ; potato cake ; scotch pancake ; 1-2 large eggs ; It will often be accompanied by toast too.......... just in case the fry-eater should feel a little peckish!
