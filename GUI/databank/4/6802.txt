we are rich. we are preppy. we are better than you. we pop our collars. we wear uggs, loafers, and pointy shoes. burberry scarves and designer bags are a must. if you don't have a north face fleece and a nalgene, go home. butt pants are so hot. we have a lot of money and we spend it on alcohol and coke (and we don't mean the soda). weekends are for gettin drunk, going to frats and bars, hookin up with random hotties and sleeping it off. brunch at west is what we live for, but we certainly don't go until 12. we are white and we hate 'doids. we live for our cell phones and for aim. don't talk to us if you are not one of us.
