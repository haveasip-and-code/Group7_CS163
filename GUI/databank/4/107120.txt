rodent tendancies
'Rodent' is a term in itself that is much the same as '[Rat]', a term to describe someone who's behaviour is sneaky and likely to be connected with the underhand seduction of a potential [shag]. Except 'Rodent' is a stronger derogatory description than '[Rat]'. 'Rodent tendancies' is a blanket description of the traits associated with the behavior of a [rat]/rodent.
