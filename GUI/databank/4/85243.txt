redbow
1. A person who is considered strange to other people. This person will do utterly strange and unbelievably nutty things, and can be considered 'Redbow'. ; 2. A complete spaceout who does not follow trends or a ubculture. 'Redbow' will just do what he feels, and can get along with most people. This person does not actually conform to a stereotype and shouldn't be labled sane at any cost. ; 3. If you witness a Redbow in the wild, the sanatarium has been breached and you should call the town Mime to outwierd him. If there's a 'illuminati' sign attached to him though, no futher action needs to be taken, as hes most likely allready locked up, and looked after in the illuminuttie nuthouse.
