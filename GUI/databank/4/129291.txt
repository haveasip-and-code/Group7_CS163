Reeses
Much like an Oreo means a 'white Black guy' (black on the outside, white on the inside), a Reeses is a person who is black on the outside, yet brown on the inside. In most cases the brown is Hispanic, though it can be other races where the people are primarily brown. ; These 'Reeses' are very rare, there are many more [White Chocolate Reeses] seen around.
