Joe Strummer
One of the greatest people who ever has or ever will walk the face of this earth. He was a musician, a political activist, and an all around great guy. Born John Graham Mellor on August 21, 1952. Fronted one of the greatest bands of all time, [The Clash]. After their breakup, he went on to have a solo career and work in film. In 1999, he formed Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros, a great band. He died on December 22, 2002, at the age of 50. It just goes to show, only the good die young. RIP.
