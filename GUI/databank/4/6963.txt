sylvester stallone
Great actor, has done some great movies in his time such as the Rocky series, Cliffhanger, Demolition Man and who could forget Rambo, those are just some of his movies. Although a good actor he seems to be shrinking, don't ask me I just tell it like it is. Birth complications, caused by forceps, resulted in paralysis of the lower left side of his face, manifested by a perennial snarl and slurred speech. Most noticeable when he is yelling.
