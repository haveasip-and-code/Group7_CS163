Fahrenheit 911
A movie made by michael moore to use people who were affected by 9/11 or the iraq war against bush. A huge number of things moore said in this movie were complete and utterly false. If you hate bush, hate him for the right reasons, I am all for political debate but this is political ignorance on moores behalf.
