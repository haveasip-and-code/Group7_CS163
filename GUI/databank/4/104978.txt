Alexandra Park
A fabulous national park visited by many, especially from nearby villages such as Moss Side and Longsight. Many youngsters use this quaint place to go for a jog with their new handbag or pension book, while others simply enjoy relaxing by the duck pond whilst brushing up on their weapon handling skills. ; This is one of the most historic sights in England as many brothers were slayed here in bloody gang wars, many hundreds of days ago.
