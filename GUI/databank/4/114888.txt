skippin'/skipped
The lingo used describing a lapse (or possibly many lapses) in time while using drugs, commonly experienced after long bouts of skatin' (using the drug form of meth known as *ice/clear*). These moments, more often than not, cannot be recalled unless reminded about from a friend, one whom witnessed the skipped time in question, when there was such a 'skip in time' for the user.
