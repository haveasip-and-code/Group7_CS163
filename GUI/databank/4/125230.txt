Holy Toledo
Most likely first used in the early 1900s, either refers to a sarcastic remark about Toledo, Ohio or originated from a realistic remark of the Holy city of Toledo, Spain. It is now used as a phrase, by Americans, if something is unbelievable, disturbing, or blows their mind. See [blow your mind]
