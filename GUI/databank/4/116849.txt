Hacked by Chinese
'Hacked by Chinese!' appeared in the text of the Code Red Worm which attacked a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS web servers in July, 2001. In some internet forums, the phrase has become a put-down synonymous with 'you lose!' The meaning of the original term is obscure; perhaps a reference by the originators of the worm to a supposed Chinese-American internet war, though the origin of the worm, which infected some 250,000 computers within 9 hours according to NIPC, was never traced.
