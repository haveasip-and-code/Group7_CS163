Iggy Pop
Real name James Oaserberg or something like that. Iggy b/c he was drummer (yes drummer) in a band called the Iguanas. After seeing the Doors in concert, was mezmerized and started his own band, the Stooges, which inspired all punk bands and basically there would be no punk without them, but they were not punk, there's no genre for that level of greatness. The first punk band that was punk, not proto-punk, was the Ramones. Not Stooges MC5 or Velvet Underground, tho they laid out the basics.
