Clownhead
A phrase which was coined by a well known Belfast shoplifter on a train to Bangor. He called his wife, who was carrying nine aged plastic bags each containing a single sheet of paper, a 'Clownhead Ballroot'. Presumably the term Clownhead refers to someone who's head resembles that of a clown. Given the womans deshevled appearence, gaunt features and howling, it appears to have been an accurate description.
