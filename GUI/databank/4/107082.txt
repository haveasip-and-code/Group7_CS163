Krablar
In the card/poker game, texas hold-em, you are dealt two down cards. If you are dealt, King-Three (K3) it also know as the King-Crab (for the three's resemblance to a crab) or the 'Krablar'. If one were to win the hand with these holdings, it is suggested that they make a pinching motion with their fingers in a salute to the Krablar.
