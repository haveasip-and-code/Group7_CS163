tank drop
Sometimes seen as a cheesy tactic in strategy games in which a player will load up any transport with a heavy vehicle, like a tank or catapult, moves forward and unloads it, kills some people with it, then loads it back up again and runs away. He repeats until you figure out that you should stop him.
