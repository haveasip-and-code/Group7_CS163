flak monkey
In Unreal Tournament, what experienced players call newbies who favor the flak cannon. It annoys them, because they learned long and hard to aim like bots, and with this weapon it's possible to win a matchup just by knowing where the enemy will go next. ; It is then implied, that aiming were the highest of all gaming skills, and thus it'd destroy the game if you can make points without it. Ironically though, any simple bot can aim like a pro, predicting where an enemy will go next is beyond the abilities of any UT bot I know of.
