Boppington
A synonym for a very sexy actor, who apperared numerously in the only 80's magazine in existence, as it were. This phrase is used often in civilized conversation following the word 'Joseph'. This term was first used in the late 1800's, meaning 'Sexy' or 'Perfection'. The very mention of this phrase often gives women and men alike a feeling of pleasure or 'deppgasm'. Synonyms for this phrase are 'the sex', 'Jose', 'Joe', 'JD' and of course 'Johnny' or 'Depp'. See 'deppgasm' or 'Johnny Depp'.
