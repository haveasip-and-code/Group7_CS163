track
A sport were kids (like myself) who are no good at any sport that requires reflexes and gereral motor skills, run (or fall down and catch themselves) relatively fast in one big circle. Which makes the sport completely pointless and it is only acknoledged every four years when a bunch of black men (like myself) kill the hopes and dreams of every other race in this world. That's if they wanted to be track stars.
