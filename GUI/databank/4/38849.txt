Otaku
Unfortunately an extremely hated word, the definition for Otaku is, when you get right down to it, an anime obsessor. These (us) are people who love anime. They're obsessed, they're nerds, and they know it (True, from personal experience as an Otaku, and I still am a proud one!). ; This doesn't mean that they have no social life. In fact their social life is about the same, if not better, than non-Otakus since there are just so many other Otaku out there to talk with! ; Another myth is that they have no social life. WRONG! I have a fioncee` and we're both Otaku. I know guys who are Otaku who have girlfriends, too. Pretty good ones at that. ; Just because you're an Otaku and will do pretty much anything for anime does not mean that you have no social life or ever will have one. True that it's mostly on the computer but not always, definitely not always.
