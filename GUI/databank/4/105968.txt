toe-holing
Conning someone into speeding to divert the attention of highway patrol men away from you. This delicate ruse is executed by pretending to race and subsequently lose to a total stranger. This decoy will then excessively speed to bolster their victory over you and thus lessen your chances of being pulled over for your own modest speeding. This person has been toe-holed.
