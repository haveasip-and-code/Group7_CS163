BGD
Street Organization formed in Chi-town by King David as the Black Gangster Disciples. King David later died and the group began infighting between King Shorty and The Chairman Larry Hoover. Hoover formed todays Gangster Disciples and King Short created the Black Disciples. The 6 point star plays on 'Kind David' and the common symbols are the pitchfork formed by sticking out your middle finger and bending your thumb and index finger if you lames were throwing up E's. Another gang traced back to BGD are the New Breeds. But that's another story.
