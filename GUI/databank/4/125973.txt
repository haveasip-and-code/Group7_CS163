Bville Girls
Females originating from Burtonsville, Maryland who know where and how to have a good time. Even if they go away to college or on a vacation, they always get the party started. They might even resort to extremes such as turning on gangster dance music at a hicktown party, dancing on bars to receive money that is placed conveniently in bras or panties or both, and removing clothing. Can frequently be found in either the Burtonsville Shopping Center, McDonald's or Burtonsville Crossing's parking lots deciding where the best party will be at that night or drunk at Paint Branch's football and basketball games. When they are away at college, they can be found dancing on top of roofs and smoking in the woods behind a honor student's dorm building. They usually pregame harder than anyone else parties (especially Blake students) and are extremely skilled at avoiding/running away from the popo.
