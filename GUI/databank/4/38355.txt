Cameron Diaz
One of the ugliest and most overrated actresses in Hollywood. She has scraggly hair, a pasty blotchy complexion, beady little eyes, and a huge clown mouth that's known for unintelligent remarks and a bimbo hyena like laugh - what's attractive about that?? ; Cameron fits into mainstream Hollywood - white, skinny, blonde, blue-eyed, perky/peppy. It's one of the major reasons for her success as she has NO acting talent whatsoever. Not only that, but look at her filmography and anyone can see those movies are horrific i.e. Very Bad Things, Charlie's Angels, etc. She just needs to disappear off the face of the Earth altogether.
