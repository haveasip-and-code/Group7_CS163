webster's
Usually refering to the print version of a dictionary pioneered by Webster himself. Before his time people spelled words any damn way they choose to. ; Too often people think that Webster's has not entered the digital age. This is simply untrue. Look Up Merriam-Webster and you will find thier site which is free. While it is true that the dictionary there is by no means complete, it is authoritative and will get you through college. When you can't find a word there of course turn to urbandictionary.com
