nothin' but the rent
Originally (early 70s or so), a standard cliched response to the question 'What's up?'. Then, in the late 80s/early 90s, a new generation misunderstood the origin of the response so that it soon became the standard reply to similar questions, such as 'How ya doin'?' or 'What's goin' on?'
