jigaleg
Dialect of most West Texans who aren't hicks yet talk with a strong Southern accent. Commonly identified by an excess of I's 'oo''s and/or overemphasis on many vowels on some words. You know it's jigaleg if the speed of delivery suggests mild mental retardation but carries a mysterious charm and is surprisingly easy on the ears.
