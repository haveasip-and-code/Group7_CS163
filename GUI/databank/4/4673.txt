anime fans
Anybody that loves anime is an anime fan. That person is NOT an [otaku] unless if he/she is really an anti-social type. No one is too old or too young to be an anime fan... They can be cool, popular, nerds, simpleton and etc but when anime fans meet together, there is always something to talk about..
