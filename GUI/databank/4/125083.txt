Simmons College
An all girl's school in Boston MA. Known for its challenging academics and tight knit community of alumni, Simmons college has every type of girl from rich white preppy snobs, to butch lesbians who refuse to shave. Most of the girls that go there are rejects from Wellesley College, Smith College and Mt. Holyoke.
