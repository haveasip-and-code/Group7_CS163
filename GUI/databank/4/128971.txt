Tsukuyomi
Tsukuyomi means 'Shinto, God of the Moon'. ; In [Naruto], Uchiha [Itachi] uses this as a jutsu. ; It gives him the power to cause terrible tourment to a person inside their head... The jutsu doesn't follow any sort of timeline and what seems like mere seconds, could easily be many years of heavy torture... Making it an incredibly powerful jutsu. This jutsu also uses amazingly high levels of chakra and is uses very rarely, due to this.
