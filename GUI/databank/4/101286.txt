Allegro
The Austin Allegro was a car built by British Leyland between strikes and the year 1973-82. These cars were alright for their time but the poor build quality and the ill-concieved design at times is what did for these cars and gave them their bad reputation. By the time the Allegro S3 came along in 1979 it had been largely redeveloped into what it should have been when launched 6 years previously. Typical british really, a good idea blighted by shite workforces and bad design.
