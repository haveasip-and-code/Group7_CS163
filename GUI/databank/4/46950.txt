simpsons
1. The greatest show on network TV. Also the inspiration for every modern, primetime, cartoon series (watch family guy and compare themes to old episodes of the Simpsons). It has evolved from just a 'funny show' to a program that takes satirical cracks at American society and certain current events. This natural evolution is completely normal, and for all the poser simpsons fans out there who think it's 'not funny anymore' have obviously missed the point. ; 2. An excellent teaching tool for showing foreigners what American culture is like.
