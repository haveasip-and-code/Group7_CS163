Omnislashing
The method of quoting someone's forum post piece by piece (often taking their words out of context) in order to disect, degrade and ridicule their argument. ; This term originated on the Relic forums back in 1999-2000 when a user there named Omnislash regularly used this method to argue with other forum members.
