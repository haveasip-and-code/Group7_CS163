Hollow
A freaky monster from the Bleach manga. A Hollow is a fallen spirit that is born from a regular spirit (plus) that has lingered in the living world after death too long. After awhile, a plus (especially a lonely and desperate one) degenerates into a Hollow. Hollows are huge, freakish monsters with strange masks that hide their identity. They seek out other spirits and humans in order to satisfy their loneliness by eating their souls.
