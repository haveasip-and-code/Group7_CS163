rating community
A place where a bunch of elitist, 'attractive' kids get together in a pack forming a sort of 'club' to help raise their self esteem in which normal people apply and they give them 'yes' or 'no' answers as to if they are ugly or not. If you get more yes's than no's you can be a member of their pack and are able to vote on other applicants. Rating communities are usually on any online journaling system (livejournal, greatestjournal, xanga etc.)
