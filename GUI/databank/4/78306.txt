pink tee
A homophobic comment refering to people who wear pink. After rapper Camron wore pink, the song 'pink tee' was cut to make fun of him and insinuate that he is homosexual because of his choice in colour. This saying is generally used by men who are not comfortable with their own sexuality and need to demasculate others to make them selves feel like big men.
