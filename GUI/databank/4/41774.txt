Xbox
1) A console produced by Microsoft in which they lose money per console sold. ; 2) A horrible, generic, clunky console created by the low quality company, Microsoft. It is a console that only survives because of Halo, and without it, it would be nothing. Microsoft believes it is a valid strategy to buy out as many companies as possible to create games for their console only; even though once said games are released, they are still awful. Known to have a large following of [Xbots], they will blindly sacrifice their lives to make sure that everyone believes Xbox is the best just because it has Halo. ; 3) A console which has two good exclusive titles: Halo and Halo 2. All other titles are a) bad or b) multiplatform. ; 4) A console that is of such poor quality that thousands had to be recalled because the adaptor cable was defective and could cause fires. Controllers are bigger than most houses.
