hizzle
taken from the 'rappin' human twiglet, snoop dogg, and his new version of the english language, it is believed to mean 'hook'. ; can be heard in all its absurd glory on the new john legend album 'get lifted' on a track entitled 'i can change' which features a surprisingly understandable and almost meaningful guest verse from the doggfather himself. ; see also [fo' shizzle my nizzle] and other such nonsense.
