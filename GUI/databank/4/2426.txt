happy slap
Happy Slap - Un like the others above some true some false, happy slapping came about with the making of video cameras, its been about since the HI-8s and now moved on to mobile phones. ; A typical stereotype is a person aged 14-18 years, waring a cap, hoodie or a stripy jumper with also market bought jogging bottoms with the known 3 stripes going down towards the feet also waring trainers like Reebok or Nike sometimes but rarely a skateboarder make like DC. ; You'll know when they'll attack you as it happens as soon as they or you sit down and the mobile will be off to the seat on your left/right side or even right behind you if it happens in the street. ; One way to combat this is to carry your own camera/mobile camera and just as or after they hit you get a picture of them give it to the police or what not stating you want to press charges as they attacked you. ; You could do as shown above, catch them by suprise and hit them in-stead but if so make sure you hit them hard enough so that you can run.
