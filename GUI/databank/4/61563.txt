bedside rag
Usually an old t-shirt, this can be any textile material which is relatively absorbant. The rag is kept at your bedside and used to clean up the goo after you have finished your hand-loving. There are several methods which it is possible to use; goo into your hand and wipe;goo onto your stomach and wipe; or the most popular method is to rest the t-shirt on your stomach so you can goo straight onto it. The bedside rag lets you go to town without having to get up and clean yourself, so that you can sleep like a a dirty little baby.
