ford focus
Ford Focus - One of the best handling hatches ever made, thnaks to the independent rear suspension. It completely makes up for the fucktard ford escort, which was practicaly a Ford piece of shit, the bare minimum plus 10% added on. The focus revolutionized the hatch market, by being affordable, well engineered, and nicely styled. Except for the US and Russian built ones, the quality is pretty good. Unfortunatly, Ford bean counters never allowed the bonkers Focus RS version to be ever made. Beats the hell out of all but the Alfa 147. Better than the bloated MkV Golf.
