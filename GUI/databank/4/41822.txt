The best soap ever. in england it is aired on the bbc twice a day, and as well as covering some really deep and emotional storylines (custody battles, alcoholism, divorce etc) it has a really good blend of humour (tango lessons, lou and harold, fashion for the over-45's etc) as well as taking the mick out of soaps in general (recently, libby and susan got addicted to a brazilian soap, libby ended up sleeping with an actor guy from it (alessandro cortezzzzzzzzz)and then left, so lyn had to break the news in a bizzarly over-soapy manner 'she was orphaned as a child, had to fend for herself on a desert island, and has a condition where she goes mad'... fantastic). ; You have to watch neighbours, because it is uber-fantastich!!
