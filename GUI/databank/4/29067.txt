Cum
Cum has a few definitions... it can be a man's semen, a female's vaginal liquids, or, the act of orgasming. Cum is a warm, thick, whitish substance that tastes different depending on what you eat. For example, if a guy ate pineapple before a blowjob, it would taste very sweet, but if he ate something like Chinese food, look out.
