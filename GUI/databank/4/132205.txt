ghetto wine
Fruit flavored wine drinks usually found in urban area convenience stores for a relatively cheap price. The taste like crap too. Ghetto wines are typically fortified, meaning that they actually add alcohol to get you more fucked up. Night Train and Thunderbird are the granddaddy's these days, ever since MD 20/20 stopped fortifying their red grape wine. Other types are available as well.
