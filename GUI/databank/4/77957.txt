Chicago-style pizza
Sometimes called deep-dish or pan pizza, an excellent type of pizza originating in Chicago in the early 1940s. Now often misdescribed as 'thick crust', the pizza generally has a thin or medium crust made of flour and cornmeal, upon which is laid a thick layer of cheese, with tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes on top. It is available all over the world, although the authenticity is questionable outside of Chicago. ; Interestingly, many prominent Chicagoland pizzerias serve only thin pizza (i.e. not Chicago-style) which is also very popular if not moreso among Chicagoans. Some area pizza parlors offer both styles, apparently to cater to out-of-town rubes who want to try Chicago-style.
