Boots
refers to a person who wears the same pair of boots all the time, or only wears boots, no other footwear...ever. ; generally a person who has fits of destructive apathetic boredom for no other reason than an enjoyment of breaking things that man has created. ; the kinda guy who would spend huge money on boots or a good jacket or something random for a friend, even knowing he'll have to half starve for a week afterwards.
