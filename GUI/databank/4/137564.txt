2 Pac
A rapper who is still selling millions of records even though he is supposedly dead. Many people still believe the man is alive living in some other country and may some day come back. There are many clues and reasons behind why people think this may happen. For those people who think he was shot, 2 Pac's killer is unkown. Some think that Suge Knight killed him (There are also many clues leading towards that). Whatever really happened, 2 Pac is arguably the best rapper of all time, and we all miss him.
