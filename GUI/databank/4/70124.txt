philippines
A country made of islands whoes beauty is forgotten because of all the garbage, pollution, and chaos from the city. There is in fact more than just garbage and squatter families in philippines. There are amazing white beaches, and amazing forests. The Philippines is in fact an ASIAN country, we are not 'pacific islanders.' It is the third largest english speaking country in the world.
