Chelmsford
A small town 30 miles from Boston, that no one has heard about unless they lived here, or have a friend from here. There's nothing to do on the weekends, kids think its cool to hang out at Stop & Shop. ; Unless you live in the center of the town, it takes twenty minutes to get from one place to another. And our rotary changed from a simple circle to a messed up square. ; There's nothing to do but get wasted or high, and if you want drugs, just walk across the street, because you're neighbor is probably dealing them. ; If you're a football player, then you're set for life in this town, you become the hero, and get out of speeding tickets and possession of drugs.
