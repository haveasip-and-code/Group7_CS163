What a lot of young people are in Europe becuase the government pays all their education expenses so what they do is drink and fuck and do drugs all the time while taking the bare minimum in BS classes to keep receiving government funding, which includes cost of living (booze/drug money). ; They purposly never graduate so they can continue living the life style they are living for free.
