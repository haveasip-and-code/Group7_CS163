Electrikk
A new trend, namely on [xanga]. Offshoots from the [EMO] trend. It varies: many people strongly dislike 'electrikks' because of their annoying and odd habits. It is this writer's opinion that using ';' or '&&' ONCE IN A WHILE is fun to spice up your writing..You know, make it look more pressentable or unique...HOWEVER...Connecting every single fucking sentence and using 'kthx' and 'BANG-BANG' repeatedly and things like that gets annoying. Electrikk is ok, as long as its not all out, over done to the max.
