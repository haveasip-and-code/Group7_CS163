Dinosaur Jr
A band that formed in the early 80's, and pretty much started the whole 'grunge' sound before the rest of them came along from Seattle. The split-up officially about 1999, but the lead singer/guitarist, J Mascis now has another band J Mascis + the Fog. All of Dino Jr's albums were pretty good, of cousre some were weaker than others (all of them weaker than 'You're Living All Over Me') but they were all solid albums.
