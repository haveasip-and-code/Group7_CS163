Monica Lewinsky
college student, only 21 and not too bright, who probably just caved in to powerful-old-man pressure. because rich old men, especially politicians, will do *anything* to get a lube job! do a washington internship yourself, if you don't believe me. it takes some intelligence to get OUT of sleeping with them... and your average college student is neither morally opposed nor wise in the ways of the world. ; by the time they're 35, most people forget about the stupid things they did at this age. i know i will, and i wish poor m.l. could too!
