SNES
Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The non-Jpanese version of the Super Family Computer (Super Famicom). 16bit game system that brought us classic games such as Final Fantasy VI, Zelda, Yoshi's Island, Street Fighter II, Chrono Trigger etc. etc. ; Nintendo also was planning on a CD based SNES with collaboration with Sony but this partnership failed and so the '[Playstation]' was produced solely by Sony, and Nintendo forever lost the ability to have CD-ROM support in their consoles (They also messed up with Phillips).
