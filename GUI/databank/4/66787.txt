Joe Shines
(1) n. A man who gained mythic status in amongst Las Vegas youth in the late 90's for being the man who no one ever met, yet everyone adored. Known for being a real nice guy, a modern buddah, and for having a very small right hand. And working at round table pizza. ; Through a single obsessed kid, his name spread throughout local High Schools and through speculation and gossip alone, spurred clubs and 'Joe Shines' parties. Joe Shines hats and t-shirts were regular attire. Transplanted by college bound ; 'Joeheads' of the time, present Joe Shines clubs exist at Texas A&M, LMU in Los Angeles, and at SFU in San Fransisco, near where most believe to be his present whereabouts. A documentary about the '99 riot at Gorman High School over a Joe Shines related dispute is currently in production and slated for a '06 festival release.
