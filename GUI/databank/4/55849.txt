roadytart
When the passenger, upon entering an automobile, pulls the door handle at the same time the driver presses the 'unlock' button. This creates a state of limbo where the driver thinks the door is unlocked, but the passenger cannot enter the vehichle. Until the driver presses the unlock button again (without the passenger's interference), the two said parties are stuck in a state of confusion, resulting in roadytart.
