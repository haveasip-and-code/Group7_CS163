Cold Turkey
When somebody quits something without weaning themselves off of it. ; Could be anything E.G: smoking, jacking off, television. ; Originates from when a [smack] (or any opiate for that matter, medical or not) addict stops taking drugs completely. The effects are feeling 'cold' (from the inside) no matter what temperature it is or how many blankets you are using. ; The turkey part comes from the same origin and when your skin goes goosepimply...like a turkey. ; I speak from personal experience.
