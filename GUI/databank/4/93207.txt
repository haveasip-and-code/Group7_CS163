kumusta ka/po
Tagalog for 'How are you?' Kumusta ka is formal and kumusta po is informal. Notice it is very similar to the spanish 'Como esta?' Thats cuz the spaniards occupied The Philippines and a lot of Tagalog words are similar to spanish. ; like puta-whore ; and sapato-shoe ; I dont speak Tagalog but i know that much. If i am off with my definition please correct me.
