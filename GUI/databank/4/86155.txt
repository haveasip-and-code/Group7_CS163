yellow eleven
childcare - the term used to describe a child's running nose, usually, an infected one (hence the 'yellow'), that displays one downward drip from each nostril, (hence the 'eleven'). Usually, the eleven starts somewhere deep in the nasal cavity, drips constantly, over the upper lip and disaapears into the child's mouth, destined to repeat the cycle.
