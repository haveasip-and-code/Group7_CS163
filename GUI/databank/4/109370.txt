Toilet Flush
In poker, it is when you end-up with nothing.....but 5 red cards, but you do not have 5 of the same suit. Instead, you have something like 3 diamonds and 2 hearts...or some other aweful combo. No pairs, a shit hand. This hand will actually beat to a full toilet. See [full toilet] definition.
