Bougie
The type of person that is HOT, they know it, and everyone else knows it! Not only do they have the right genetics they are true fashionista's in every regard. They push snobbery to the highest levels, but not in a bad way. They don't associate with lower classes because they judge them, but because they constantly strive to be the best and expect everyone around them to do the same. They're the type of people that drive the social ladder to its limits. They give everyone else something to shoot for!
