teacher arms
Upper arms that have loose, freely swinging flab in the triceps area that hangs from the elbow to shoulder, so-called because female schoolteachers often flash said flabbiness when they wear short sleeved or sleeveless tops and then stretch out across the blackboard. It is too be avoided.
