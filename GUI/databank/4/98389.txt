integra
In the United States, the Acura Integra was a sporty small car produced from 1986-2001. In 2002, the Integra was replaced by the RSX. In Japan, where the Acura nameplate does not exist, the car always has been known as the Honda Integra. ; A popular car among the import modification scene. For a relatively small investment, one can buy an Integra and build it up to be a very fast drag car or autocrossing/road racing car. ; Consumer Reports has consistently rated the RSX & Integra as 'Best Buys' for their solid reliability and excellent resale value. ; The Integra is mechnically similar to the Honda Civic, which is another reason why it is popular in the import scene -- many parts are swappable. ; In recent years, the Integra (particularly the faster GS-R and Type R models) have become targets for theft. This has driven insurance rates on those cars sky-high. Many 'chop shops' steal these cars, strip them of all parts, and then re-sell these parts to friends, on eBay, etc. Of the most value are the engines, which routinely sell for $2500 or more.
