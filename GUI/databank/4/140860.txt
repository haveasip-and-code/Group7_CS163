electric car
An automobile powered by batteries that has seen political supression over the past decade due to no need for oil changes, tune-ups, or servicing, motors that last over 500,000 miles, along with no need for crude oil in which to derive its fuel. With current technology, they can have both competitive range to an internal combustion powered car and high horsepower. See www.nedra.com for electric cars that kill Vipers and Corvettes at the racetrack. www.plasmaboyracing.com has another notable example.
