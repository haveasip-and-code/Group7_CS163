Shoreditch twat
Usually a new media, fashion student, photographer-type person with a privileged digital or old school arts background who lives/works/socialises in London's East End area of Shoreditch. A Shoreditch twat has at some point also worked/lived/socialised in the near-by [Brick Lane]. A Shoreditch twat is defined by their [Hoxton Finn] haircut, 80s retro 90s fusion clothes (usually a suit jacket, blue ripped jeans, and white trainers/shoes), an ability to talk about pseudo-intellectual artistic bullshit with no relevance to the real world, completely up their own backsides, and a failure to comprehend that they are the laughing stock of the rest of the normal local (ethnic) population. The Shoreditch Twat has now been immortalised by the fictional [Nathan Barley] and serialised on TV by Channel 4.
