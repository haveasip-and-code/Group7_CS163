catfish noodling
Reaching down deep underwater into a dark hole and wiggling your fingers as bait hoping that a giant catfish will clamp down on your hand so you can pull it out of the hole, without getting pulled in yourself. It's a pretty stupid sport actually, and people have gotten killed by it...
