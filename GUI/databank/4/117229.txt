whipping
Whipping is the act of driving your car way too fast and 'whipping' in and out of lanes, usually cutting off other cars and sometimes causing accidents. There are two types of people that whip, middled aged men who can't get a date, and punk kids who think that even though their honda civic has the engine and transmission of a lawnmower, it has the soul of a Lamborghini.
