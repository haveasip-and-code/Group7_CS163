NAACP
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. They're the ones who banned 'Song of the South' and the Little Black Sambo books. Which is a shame, because 'Song of the South' portrays Uncle Remus as the lovable hero, and the Little Black Sambo books are based on old African folk tales. Ahh well.
