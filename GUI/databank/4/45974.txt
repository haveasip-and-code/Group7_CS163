ch
CH is a game term for a spell called complete heal, or anything that accomplishes the same sort of almost dead>completely full health with a different name. It's common use as a term in games like MMORPG's originated from the cleric spell 'complete heal' in everquest, but it existed earlier in some muds and such. Other games like Anarchy Online have also had complete heals even though some versions of the spell went by a different name (Invocation of the Phoenix). CH order refers to the practice of stacking multiple healers on one tank and having them cast complete heal in sequence to keep the tank alive.
