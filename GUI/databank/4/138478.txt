SVT
abbreviation for SupraVentricular Tachycardia; an EKG rhythm characterized by very fast rate and P waves which are buried in the T waves (since P waves aren't visible, we can't call it a sinus or atrial rhythm). Generated by abnormal activity of pacemaker cells somewhere in the atrioventricular junction.
