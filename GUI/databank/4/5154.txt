Che Guevara
A man whose picture appears on red T-shirts at [Hot Topic] for around $15-20 bucks. You can also buy iron-on patches and label buttons with Che's face on them for about $1 buck each. ; What better way to display your [fad]-driven support of Communism by buying merchandise supplied by large corporations? Who cares if your supporting the 'machine', he looks so badass on those T-shirts. You're sure to impress all your punk/stoner friends and maybe attract that cute alternachick that sits in front of you in your art class if ol' Che is with you.
