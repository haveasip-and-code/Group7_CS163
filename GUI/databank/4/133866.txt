Hamden
Small town in CT with abolutely nothing to do. We are known for extreme amounts of drama; there is always some fight or some kind of problem amongst the people in Hamden, mostly caused by drama from Stop and Shop. The town is also home to some of the gayest snitches around who like to call the cops, lol
