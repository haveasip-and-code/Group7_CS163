Duffington
There is an urban legend, of a powerful rage, that awakens inside the human soul. There is someone named Duff, and inside him lays rage incarnate. When the rage boils to the surface, he transforms into Duffington. Duffington is a dark entity that revels in the night and looks for unsuspecting victims to slaughter. It is impossible to know when he is coming for you and impossible for anyone to track him, as he glides over the ground and melds into shadows. The last thing victims ever hear is a small cackle before their throat is slit.
