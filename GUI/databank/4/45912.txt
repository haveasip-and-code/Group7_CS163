Toronto raptors
A team in desperate need of a new change and direction next season. ; Some changes -> First off, get rid of players who don't wanna play in Toronto (like what they did to Vince Carter). Players including Jalen Rose (who's overpaid for inconsistent offence and lack of defense), Rafer Alston, Lamond Murray, Aaron Williams, and while you're at it, waive useless players like Loren Woods, Pape Sow, Eric Williams, and Milt Palacio. ; Then sign some other players who will actually play some team-d and give their all cuz the Raptors are reekin' now i tell ya. i'm disgusted to be a raptors fan...
