the breakfast club
the best movie i have ever seen. its funny and drmatic at the same time. its about five people who are completely different, having to spend a day in detention together. They come to relaize that their differences can bring them closer, and in many ways theyre a lot alike. the 'impossible' was reached (having them all relate) and they formed the breakfast club. greatest movie iv seen so far in my life.
