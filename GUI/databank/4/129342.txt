Door lock anticipation
That brief period between when the driver gets in the car and when he unlocks the passenger door for a friend waiting to get into the car. ; The passenger often tries to open the door a few times before it is actually unlocked. Sometimes the attempts to open the door and the actual unlocking of it coincide, and the attempt negates the unlocking.
