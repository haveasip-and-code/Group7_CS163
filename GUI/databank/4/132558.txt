spodie
A mixture of several kinds of alcohol, fruit juice, and cut up peices of fruit, that has formented over night so the fruit is more potent than the juice itselve. Spodie is usualy made in coolers, fishtanks, bathtubs, or brand new garbage cans. 2 parts liquer. 1 part (any)fruit, 1 part fruit juice. Do not refrigerate for at least 12 hours, then chill to serve. If made right you cannot taste the booze unless you eat the fruit.
