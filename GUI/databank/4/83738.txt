Rick Moranis
A very tiny man often mistaken for a hobbit, pixie, or other minature mystical creature. Has made appearances in numerous blockbuster movies, but still has respect from a grand total of 0 people. He hosted Saturday Night Live once, I saw the episode and he sucked. He is often compared to the likes of Bob Saget and it is highly debated who is lamer. Since 1990, Moranis has starred in a slew of family films that try to have some sort of moral, although this moral is always: 'Even if you are short, have a small penis, and glasses, you can still be liked by people.' Pfft, I doubt that Rick, I doubt that; no one likes the small cocked, 75 pound kid with glasses. I will conclude with an excerpt from the Moranis movie 'Little Giants': 'Even if those Cowboys beat you 99 times out of a 100, that would still leave.....' One time? No, because in real life those kids would have gotten destroyed by the obviously more superior Cowboys. Good job giving the kids false hopes of being successful in life dick face.
