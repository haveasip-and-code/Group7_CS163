ElleGirl
[katie and ellie] have come to use this term in there much varied and interesting everyday vocabulary and it stems from the magazine 'Elle Girl'. ; Now, we have nothing against the magazine persay - infact we read it monthly but what does annoy us is the fact that girls who read this magazine SLASH those who customise their clothes, think that they are the bees knees. ; For example, a girl who wears so called 'original' clothes with ribbons and slash or broches could generally be described as an ElleGirl. They are normally incredibly up themselves and can be noticed because they wear ponchos with tassles (see [ponchomania]). ; Approach with caution.
