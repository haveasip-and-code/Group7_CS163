Eye Socket Rape
Eye Socket Rape, is, sadly, an actual theme in some Japanese Hentai Doujinshi (porn fan comics, like, a Sailor Moon porn fan comic)) and hentai manga (porn comics). The only place I've ever seen it is in a popular sex comic published by ErosComix(.com), the name of which I'm not quite sure of, though the series features a futanari (dick-girl, aka, woman with a penis) named 'Jun'. ; Anyway, as you can tell by the word, it involves a penis entering a woman's (usually, can be a man's) eye socket, and utterly destroying the eye during the penetration and sexual act. This is usually not consensual sex, thus why it is called 'Eye Socket Rape', though I know at least one incident where it was consensual. ; It's in the last issue of that comic, anyway.
