Firony
A contraction of the nouns 'irony' and 'fire'; invented due to the poor naming of items in the Nintendo 64 game 'Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time'. ; In the game exists an item named 'Cold Fire'. In a sense, it is very crudely ironic that fire can be cold. Hence, to liven up the name, 'Cold Fire' was named 'Firony' by some gamers.
