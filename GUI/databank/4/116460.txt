Roundtop
Place on Northfield at [NMH] where couples go to have sex. There is a group of pine trees (God knows who planted them there, or why they did) which is quite popular. Don't go in there if you don't want to see used [condoms], and smell some pretty gross things. [DL Moody] and his wife are buried up there, but no one really cares. People pee on them, sometimes.
