kabir
Kabir (1440 - 1518) was an Indian Mystic who preached an ideal of seeing all of humanity as one. He was known to be a weaver and later became famed for scorning religious affiliation, seen as a threat to both Muslim and Hindu elite. His monist philosophies and ideas of loving devotion to God are expressed in metaphor and language from both the Hindu Vedanta and Bhakti streams and Muslim Sufi ideals. ; Other than tht Kabir is pimpest piece of shit in tha world hooty hooty hoot hooo (esp. tha one in Detroit)
