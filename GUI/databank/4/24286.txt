nautical star
Nautical Stars are an old sailor's tattoo, sailors took on these tattoo's as before navigational equipment became available they would use the stars. Having the tattoo would be like always having a star with you. ; These are now popular tattoo's, the their symbolism is now more of they're a symbol of following your dreams, or of security. ; Sadly, a lot of jerks just get these tattoo's because they look cool and don't have a clue what they mean.
