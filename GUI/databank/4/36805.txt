towson
not only do preps run towson, they over run it's walls in a sea of pastel and shabby hair over the ears. You can smell them in the surrounding residential areas in the mean streets of towson. The parents piling kids with juice boxes in hand out of thier minivan with tvs in the back. ; Where the 'cool alternative scene' consists of Ten-Car-Pile up that on certain saturday nights the barrage of leather jackets and colorful die rule the streets. ; Where no matter how many girls are at a party, 'there are like, no girls here'. ; No matter how big the party is 'there's not that many people' ; It's also status quo to get your dad to buy you that LV bag or that $1200 yorkie from Just Puppies.
