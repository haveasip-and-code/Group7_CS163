The Church Of Havok
A websight dedicated to [Davey Havok] of[AFI]for all the the fans to meet, make friends and shair our love of Davey. Some are more serious about this saying 'Davey is our lord there is no truth but his...' and other like myself who just use it as a fan sight end enjoy the comrodery. I believe the church has actually been shut down but it dosn't natter we still love Davey and we still call ourselves members of the church. Some people think of it as a cult and others as a giant fan club. Davey himself is always saying'I love my children' the [fall children] weather he meens it in a strange cult lord way or another way to say 'i love my fans' it dosn't matter. he has a huge and very loyal following in The Church.
