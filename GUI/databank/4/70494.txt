A non-existent information source cited in research when published sources do not exist (e.g., anecdotal information, unpublished industry knowledge), or when presented material was spontaneously created by the author (e.g., a novel framework to explain a business issue). Derived from the phrase 'pulled it out of my ass', contemporized to the age of the Internet.
