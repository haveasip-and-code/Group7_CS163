Topeka
Topeka is the capital of Kansas. Topeka has had a stagnate population of 120,000 people. Topeka attracts very little on account of careless citizens as well as a disorganized city government which is mocked by secular group of bigots known as the Phelps clan. Topeka also has one of the highest crime rates per capita in the nation. There is little to do in Topeka for young people as well as middle aged people who seek a night life. Topeka has no night life, very little culture, and very little reason for young people to settle there after college. The city also has a hard time attracting any young families. Shawnee, Kansas can attract young families where as Topeka cannot do such a thing. Topeka would have died out years ago if it was not the state capital. Can something similar be said about state capitals in general? If you live in the Greater Kansas City area or Lawrence, then there is no reason to ever go to Topeka. There generally is never a legitimate reason to visit Topeka unless you are interested in touring the capital building and seeing the World Famous Topeka Zoo, which now has to be maintained by the county. Topeka is devasting.
