WAKA
Promising of spreading 'the joy of kickball', The World Adult Kickball Aassociation (WAKA) was founded in 1998 in Washington, D.C. and was supposed to be an 'alternative' to the local softball teams which were deemed 'too competitive' for some. By 2001 there were 4 divisions in the DC metro area and by 2003 it had started to spread across the country. Was a good time until the novelty wore off, they raised the dues and generally just got way too big way too fast. With divisions in every city, it has now become what it set out to counteract and is now nothing more than a shell of it's former self.
