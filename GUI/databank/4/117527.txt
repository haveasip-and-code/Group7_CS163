Justy
A sub-compact car made by [Subaru], from 1987-1994. Like the Geo Metro and Chevy Sprint, it used a 3-cylinder engine. The Justy engine had a larger displacement volume, though -- 1189cc vs. 993cc. ; The only drawback is that it wasn't designed to to be driven FAST on the highway. But if it's not pushed to its limits, it'll certainly hold out longer than most of that American crap on the road today.
