Merge of Shame
On a two lane limited-access freeway the 'merge of shame' is where you are in the far left lane against the wall while a vehicle tailgates you. The car behind you accelerates to illegaly pass you on the right, changes lanes without signaling but before they pass and cut you off they are forced to get back behind you due to a SLOWER moving car in the right lane.
