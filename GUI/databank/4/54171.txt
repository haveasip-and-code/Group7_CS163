Cellot
The categorization of individuals who pull out their cellphones at inappropriate periods of time, regardless of surrounding social activity and social propriety.(i.e. pulling out a cell phone while on a date, pulling out a cell phone mid sentence without warning.) ; Cellots also have a series of telling behaviors, such as hurridly reaching for their phones on whenever the generic nokia ringer is within earshot. They also feel the need to convert all non-cellots to cell phone owners.
