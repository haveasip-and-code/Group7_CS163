Sawyer
1. A character from the TV show [LOST]. Originally James Ford from Tennessee, the guy's quite complex. When he was a young boy, his dad caught his mom cheating on him with some guy named Sawyer. His dad killed his mom and then himself leaving little James an angry orphan. His mind set on revenge, James wrote a letter to Mr. Sawyer, telling him how he was going to kill him and carrying it with him always. But as he got older, he started conning people and before he knew it, James was no better than the man who was responsible for his parent's deaths. With this revelation came an unprecedented amount of self-loathing from the man. He changed his name to Sawyer and embraced the inner asshole. Sawyer tries to mask his insecurities with southern charm and forced confidence, coming off as a bully most of the time, but at certain moments he shows that he too, is human and feels pain just the same as everybody else. Played by the talented Josh Holloay. ; 2. The best damn character on TV today.
