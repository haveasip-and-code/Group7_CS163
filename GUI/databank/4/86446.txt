where is your god now
A common phrase tagged onto an image or web page so terrifyingly weird that it makes you question if god exists. Most often seen associated with the rubber-faced Burger King mascot. Also appears in religious sources (Psalm 42:3, 10; 115:2) and in a famous fictional debate between reason and faith.
