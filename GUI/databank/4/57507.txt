Oakville
A Southern town in Ontario...in which the Oakvillian's like to go to parties and chill with their friends. But of course, Mississaugan's and other cities love to make fun of Oakville for entertainment because they litterally have nothing else to do in their little ghettos. Some of the things one might hear about O-Town is: They're all rich, snobby people who get everything they want....well if we got what we wanted all the time, we wouldn't have jealous, welfare people beside us now would we? And OF COURSE we must not forget that everyone LOVES the OC....only 13 year olds like the OC...oh...and ambercrombie...no no...we all prefer gucci, prada, and especially louis vuittion....that was a joke...we shop at the same damn places as the rest of you! Garage...Bluenotes...etc...and if you come into oakville, sure you might see tons of Benz's and Lincoln's...but honestly...it's a friggin car!!!...it's not our fault if you people can only afford the toilets on wheels for transport!...but i guess that's our fault because it's not like we help ya'll with your welfare.....OOPS I GUESS WE DO!! oh..and another thing...NO ONE i mean NO ONE in O-Town says [chate], that is the stupidest word my eyes have ever read! Oh...and i forgot...yes, to live in oakville, you usually need to be somewhat wealthy because the demand to live here is growing because it's COOL!, so ya, we can afford great houses with roofs that don't leak, and that arent infested with things that crawl...why? because our PARENTS bought the house...and didnt wanna be classified as poor people if they lived in mississauga....just stating the facts...but...Oakville..tons of stuff to do...hot people...and we've got some jealous haters who have nothing else to do in their boxes on the coners of streets...
