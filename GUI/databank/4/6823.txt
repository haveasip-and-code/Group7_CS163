fruit booter
antagonistic description of a rollerblader by certain narrow minded, misguided skateboarders who are all the more insular for failing to acknowlege the complete superiority of rollerblading over skateboarding regarding overall possibilities. ; By now the term has been embraced and thus ironically inverted in meaning and delexicalized as an insult.
