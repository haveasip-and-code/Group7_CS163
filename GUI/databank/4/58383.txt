decrapitize
To decrapitize means to clean your place of all the shit that just sits around and collects dust. Pack-rats will identify with this more, but you clean freaks might not get it. ; You can clean house, but still there are piles of shit and other useless stuff that just lays around until you decrapitize and get all that shit out. Decraptization is mandatory when moving out.
