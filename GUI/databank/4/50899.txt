The United States Naval Academy
An institution of higher learning where young men go to better themselves through a college degree and a career as a naval officer upon graduation, e.g. a million dollar education shoved up ones ass, a nickel at a time. ; Graduates of this institution are generally arrogant and believe themselves to be better than any of their fellow officers who did not become so by being a graduate of the naval academy (such as persons who became officers through NROTC programs, direct commissions or through OCS). These officers usually display their USNA class rings in an overly proud and flamboyant fashion, earning them the name 'Ringknockers'.
