Thought of of the longest most stupid word(thats isnt welsh)in the world. in short term it is a joining word such as 'and' used by the han-solos of the 14th century but phased out due to the inconvience of not only its length or difficult pronounciation but for its abilty to make theatre plays such as the well known 'help my mother was killed by a excessivly large vagina from verginia' much much longer as actors had to spend many extra seconds saying it, instead of 'and'.
