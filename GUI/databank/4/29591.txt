resident evil 4
A very, very kickass game for the Nintendo [Gamecube]. Starring ex-S.T.A.R.S. member Leon Kennedy. Some fucktards hate this game because it's different than the other RE games. Don't listen to them. With loads of blood, gore, violence, and language, RE4 should shut up the people who bash the GCN because of it's 'kiddy' reputation.
