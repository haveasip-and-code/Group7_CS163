Opie and Anthony
A fantastic radio duo that always end up getting what they want. They started in Long Island, moved to Worcester/Boston's WAAF station, released a few CD's, got fired for an April Fool's prank, moved to NY, becamse nationally syndicated(!), and again were fired for pushing the limits of radio talk. They can now be heard on XM Satellite Radio.
