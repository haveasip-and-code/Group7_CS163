guju
Inhabitants and descendants of the Indian state of Gujarat. ; Those who speak the Indian language Gujarati. ; Known for their business minds, agriculture, and strong cultural values. Traditions include garba (dancing and clapping in circles)and raas(dance style involving sticks)-two of the most popular dances in the state. Also known for having taken over the motel/hotel/gas station industries in America. ; The common phrase 'you guju' is a misconception of the actual characteristics of Gujaratis. Being of the business-mind, Gujus tend to look for the best deals. They value money and make the most of it. They are by no means cheap; in fact, Gujus are of the highest tier of minority incomes so CHILL OUT WITH THE GUJU JOKES! haha
