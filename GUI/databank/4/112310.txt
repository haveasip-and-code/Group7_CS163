discussion
An interplay between a man and a woman, in which a woman talks while a man tunes her out and grunts occassionally to create the illusion that he is paying attention. The woman may interpret these grunts in any way she wishes. Discussions are inherently dangerous to men, because they may unknowingly agree to things that lead to unlpeasant surprises later.
