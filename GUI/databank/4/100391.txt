Shadow the hedgehog
Shadow is a black and red hedgehog with a horrible past the only thing he was created for was to destroy the humans on the A.R.K , Maria ,the grand daughter of Proffesor Gerald Robotnik dies due to the g.u.n men , as a result the Doctor only wants revenge creating Shadow, soon after being re-awakend by Eggman and fighting in the a.r.k they soon learn what shadow's motive was all along so when Amy convinces shadow ( sa2b version) that he should help and after a little memory with Maria to help boost things up shadow teams up with Sonic to help the humans save earth I personally believe shadow is waayyy better than sonic since he would give up anything to help his friends and even though he's tough on the outside he's really kind and gentle in the indside so there's my definition of shadow the hedgehog (ps.remember kids he's mine ;D)
