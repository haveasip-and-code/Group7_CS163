Ireland
The best place on the planet. Everyone rocks there and it's so green and lovely. We have our own language which is one of the longest surviving in the world but the vast majority of us speak English because those bastards invaded our island and took all our land and opressed us with huge taxes that just went straight into the King of England's pocket, but then in the early 20th century we fought back and won most of the country back (we didn't get 6 counties in the north). Now we have a really bad government but who cares IREALND ROCKS! ; P.s. Noone in Ireland sounds the way you americans think we do. And not everyone in Ireland is called SEAMUS!
