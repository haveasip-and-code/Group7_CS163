Traditionally a white kid name, however there are some unfortunate african american Brett's out there that just don't desreve to be in this category. The Brett's out there with one 't' this definiton doesn't apply. You're just a whole other cup of tea that no one cares about. Someone with the name 'Brett' is a complete and utter [asshole], and dreadfully good-looking...most of the time. They are so cocky sometimes that they'll name themselves [God] or the [king] of all [humans]. When parent's name their [child] 'Brett,' it's usually because they had a feeling they'd turn out to be an [asshole] Only the most [jewish] of parents named their child Brett, and he is the [superasshole]. That's the one to watch out for. [George] Brett was an [asshole]. Brett Hull...asshole. Dennis Leary's middle name...Brett. Best two words to describe a Brett [loud] and [obnoxious].
