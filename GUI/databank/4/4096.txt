System of a Down
A mainstream alt-metal band of Armenian descent. They are considered a political band despite the fact that most of their songs have nothing to do with politics, though they do concern moral/ethical issues at times. They are not left wing or right wing (they criticize both in their songs, so if you think they are just trendy Bush-haters, you are wrong) but moderates, and anti-war. One of the few nu-metalers from the '99-'01 years to survive the test of time, because they are actually good.
