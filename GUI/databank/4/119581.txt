Magic Players
A group of people who play the card game Magic; the Gathering. Generally lacking all social skills and completely lacking hygiene, Magic players spend all of their money on cards instead of t-shirts to cover their hanging gut or shampoo to wash their greasy hair. Do not feel sorry for these people, they can afford to be clean, they just chose not to. They would have time to get laid, but again, they chose not to.
