Keane
A band that have been hailed in NME (and other 'trendy' magazines) for being 'orignal'. Yup, they're original, just like EVERY other dull indie band that's emerged over the past few years that releases songs that all sound the same, so teenagers can listen to them to sound 'cool', and 'alternative'. Its bands like Keane that give indie a bad name. Gone are the days of decent indie band like The Smiths, here are the days of bands like Keane. ; By the time they release their second album, all the kids will have found some other equally dull band to go 'OMFG, ORGINAL!' over. They are just a fad.
