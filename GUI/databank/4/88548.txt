Jonny the Homocidal Maniac
An extremely funny comic book series by [Jhonen Vasques](The maker of [Invader Zim]) about an artistically challenged man named Jonny who (guess what) kills people...and he ALWAYS gets away with it with the aid of his skilled tormentors(Read I Feel Sick 1 & 2. It reveals much more about Jonny's predicament.)Over all a good and hillarious read. And come on, people. Anything by Jhonen is great!!
