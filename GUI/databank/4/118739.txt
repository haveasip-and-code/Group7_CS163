Westfield
though located in New Jersey, this seemingly affluent town boasts its suburbian relation to NYC. the children of this town are enveloped in the drive to success that severely plagues this town, therefore increasing the alloted number of assholes per square mile to well beyond the national average. the past superiority of this town's sports program is the crutch on which we stand on, and this idea of furthering old reputations is the axis by which this crap vortex spins.
