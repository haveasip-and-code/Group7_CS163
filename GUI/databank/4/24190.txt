moona moona
a word used repeatly by an obese ethnic juvenile by the name of xenfacta, who is considered to lie on the botton rung of society. However the 'moona' sound omitted by this person, is seen as a godsend as when it is heard, it gives signal for a quick escape from the wrath of this obese chimer.
