mainstream
CRAPPY MUSIC that goes by the standards and implied guidelines set by other songs that are currently popular. ; The only inkling of individuality is either a) the lead singer's voice, or b)the fucking tone of the guitar. ; Both of those are still a rarity. ; Sometimes, you can define a mainsrteam band by the ranking they are at on the top 40 list, or the iTunes most popular. But not always, because sometimes good [indie] music is mistakenly put there.
