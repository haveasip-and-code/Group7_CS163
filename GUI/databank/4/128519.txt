ghetto batz
a bit like a cross between [wanksters] and [goths]; urban ghetto youth who often wear all black but miss the point of the [goth] aesthetic by also displaying elements of wannabe [gangsta] culture such as gang signs, baggy pants, [iced-out] jewelry and [homeboy] slang, and often displaying a complete ignorance of gothic music
