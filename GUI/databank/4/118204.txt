sack shot
Also spelled 'sac shot.' The act of opening the fly of the pants, pulling out the nuts (leaving the soldier in the barracks), and letting 'em hang. Then approaching a seated colleague (preferably one who is preoccupied with something), positioning the protrusions directly at eye level, and asking them a question. ; When they look up and see the testicle festival staring back at them, you got yourself a sack shot!
