squaffle
A cross between a squirrel and a waffle. They show symptoms of rabies, and stalk people with a gaint fork if one steals their marshmellows. When mixed with sulferic dioxide, they tend to explode. These buggers were first discovered by crazy arse art students, after sightings of the swopher.
