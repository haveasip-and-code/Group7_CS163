rikaloff
A brand of vodka that is handcrafted using the finest charcoal filtration. Rikaloff is said to improve in body and finish when run through a Brita water filtering pitcher. Rikaloff is most commonly found in the purses of teeny boppers ages 12-20, or in the paws of young men planning on sedating young girls for personal gain. Also known as Rik, or da Rik.
