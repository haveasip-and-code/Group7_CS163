Soccer sandal effect
(noun) - The over-reaching and yet inexplicably clever marketing gimmick of labeling and identifying a product (or person) with an often inaccurate, 'cool-sounding', or 'trendy' description so that the product/person, which would ordinarily be thought of as unattractive, unskilled, and/or worthless, now seems 'hot'. ; See also [soccer sandal].
