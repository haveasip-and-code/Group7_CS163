Lean
To create Lean, a popular drink originated from Houston Texas, you require the following for the original formula: ; -Promethazine w/Codeine VC <- Sizzurp (active ingredient) ; -Original Sprite Soda <- Mixing ingredient (although different flavors of sprite are now used, such as sprite remix) ; -Jolly rancher candy <- Flavor additive ; Put it all in a styrofoam cup and enjoy. The codeine is mainly responsible for the euphoric feeling after drinking lean. Promethazine causes motor skill impairment, lethargy, extreme drowsiness, as well as a disassociative feeling from all other parts of the body, specifically the stomach and digestive system. If it doesn't have promethazine w/ Codeine, it isn't real sizzurp. ; The mixed drink combination known as 'lean', is normally the color purple, due the added ingredient sizzurp, which is originally a dark purple syrup. There are other colors of sizzurp which can be added to create lean, but the purple is the true sizurp ; Lean does not contain ANY form of alcohol, crushed pills, or other liquids in general.
