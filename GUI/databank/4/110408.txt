space nerd
A person who's favorite things consist of: Star Trek, Star Wars, any type of Nintendo, Playstation, or computer game, and star trek/star wars conventions. ; Space nerds can quote any star wars movie on command and live in their parent's basement collecting pieces of dust balls that resemble Luke Skywalker or Lara Croft. ; You can find a space nerd at the opening of any Star Wars movie, and they will most likely be wearing a Chewbacca outfit as they ruin the whole movie for everyone else by reciting every single line in the movie.
