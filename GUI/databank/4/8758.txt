new york
I am from New York. I curse a lot. I say mad instead of wicked. I like the YANKEES. I know what REAL pizza tastes like, and I know that a bagel is much more than a roll with a hole in the middle. They're sprinkles...not jimmies. I play BEER PONG not beirut. I judge people by what exit they get off the highway. It's not called the shore, it's the BEACH. Its a wedge or a sub NOT a hoagie! It's not New York City or Manhattan, it's 'THE' CITY. Two words...MOTHER FUCKER. I know that 55 mph really means 85. When someone cuts me off, they get the horn AND the finger.'
