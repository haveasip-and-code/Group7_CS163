teju
The tejus, or tegus, genus Tupinambis, are large, fast-moving lizards of the family Teiidae. They inhabit tropical and subtropical regions of South America, where they feed on insects and small vertebrates, soft fruits, leaves, and birds' eggs. They measure 60 to 90 cm (2 to 3 ft) long and have powerful legs and long tails. The teju lays its eggs, usually six to eight in a clutch, in termite mounds, which serve as perfect incubators with well-regulated temperature and humidity.
