Furby
An amazingly scary robotic-type toy for children. It reacts to certain sounds such as 'Hello Furby,' 'Wake up, Furby,' and 'Good job!' It sings barely-audible songs, does strange little dances that look more like spasms, and screeched when you tickle it. They are made in a viriety of colors, but they all have the same over-sized black eyes and yellow beak.
