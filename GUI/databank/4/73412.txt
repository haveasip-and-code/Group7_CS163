boarding school
A frequently-stereotyped educational institution that often features a more diverse population than most people believe. Contrary to popular belief, not all boarding school students are snotty, preppy airheads and jocks. Not all are sent there as preparation for becoming trophy wives or CEOs. Boarding schools are not as weird and sheltered as they are portrayed to be (especially not for day students) and they do have significant value other than 'getting the kids out of the way'. ; Many parents send children to boarding schools for high school because they feel this will better prepare them for college life. Others live in areas with poor public schooling systems and elect to send their children elsewhere, so they can have a better education. It may come as a shock to some that many boarding school students come from extremely rural areas or from so-called 'bad neighborhoods' and are there on scholarship. ; Living at a boarding school often puts kids in contact with people they would never meet otherwise, as students often come from all over the world. Interacting with people from different places and backgrounds generally broadens the students' minds and horizons. Dorm life requires that they learn to live with other people and to effectively resolve problems with roommates and neighbors. ; It is recommended that one actually visit or attend a boarding school (as with a public or other private school) before passing judgement.
