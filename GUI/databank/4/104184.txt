Speedo
A swimsuit that resembles the male briefs underwear. Often worn by athletes or guys who are swimming for exercise, but sometimes worn by old fat hairy men who don't know that they should be covering up. Named after the company 'Speedo' that first started making them mainstream swimwear. ; Advantages: provides support for your testicles and keeps your penis in a more comfortable position while you swim. Allows you to use your legs better when you swim, and doesn't fill up with air like normal trunks. ; Disadvantages: shows off your whole body and only covers your privates, which makes it very disgusting to see old fat hairy men wearing them. Also shows off the general size of your private parts, which can be embarrassing if you have a very small [package], because everyone would see your small [bulge]. A speedo without a decent layer of lining in the front will also make it very obvious if a guy's penis is circumcised.
