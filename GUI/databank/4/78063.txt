home project higgins
The home project higgins is a dangerous predator. This occurs when a man dreams up home projects in order to lure young men up to his attic. It is still unknown what happens to the young men in the attic, but what is know is that when they are released their wrist's are so limp they can barely hold their own manhood to urinate.
