xbox 360
Basically Microsoft's next big fat console that allows blood-thirsty players to play blood-filled killing games. Will emulates incredible details and graphics of death, mutilation, blood, infiltration, conspiration, explosion, planet novas, killing and prostitution. You will have to choice between two packs: $300 for the console, a card, a wired controller and a frisbee, or the damn expensive so-good-its-from-microsoft $400 that contains everything you need in your life. ; Ideal for the asswhole family.
