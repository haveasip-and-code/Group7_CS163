2true
2true is an internet forum for Australian Graffiti. ; If you were thinking that 90% of graffiti artists were too stupid to correctly use a computer let alone the internet, you were correct. ; 2true is a total cesspool. Whenever people post pictures the forum tables are deformed since they are too unintelligent to acquire a program capable of resizing the pictures they get off their digital cameras ( or even work out the software for them. ) ; In saying this, Graffiti is great, and not all graffers are stupid. Just the majority. ; 90% of the topics on 2true are simply insult slinging and penis comparing. Common putdowns include ( but are not limited to ) [toy], [gronk] and [burke]. ; 2true is worth avoiding.
