Wobbin
A 'globulous Mass' that consumes food at a rate of 100 calories per second. The body of a wobbin is usually pulsating and has around 4-19 rolls of fat. Often mistaken for the Michilin Man as the rolls often resemble tyres. To be honest, a wobbin cannot be classified as a human - it's simply an 'it' or 'the Meister.'
