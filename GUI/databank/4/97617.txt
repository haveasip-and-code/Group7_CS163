Out
Out is literally the opposite of 'in'. ; In parts of Ireland 'out' is also used as a slang term that reinforces the word that came before it. For instance, if a new TV show comes on and you dislike it, you might say 'that show was bad out!'. If you drink too much and have a hangover you feel 'sick out'.
