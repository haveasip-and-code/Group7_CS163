marilyn manson
A [retard]ed [Harlequin fetus] and [trend whore] of epic proportions who didn't start anything, didn't finish anything, and hasn't said anything new. Ever. People seem to be offended by him for no particular reason in particular. ; He is loved by legions of obnoxious suburban [mall goth] teenagers, who apparently have nothing better to do than to waste money on buying Manson albums and [Nightmare Before Christmas] merchandise to act 'rebellious' and piss off their parents.
