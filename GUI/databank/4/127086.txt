Deuce Loosely
A twice-appeared character from the former MTV sock-puppet show, Sifl & Olly. Deuce was third in a line of 'guests' being interviewed in a segment about 'Guys Who Auditioned to Be the Drummer for KISS.' He represented a panda. It was revealed by the end of the interview that he never actually played drums before, but studies the ancient folklore of the panda. You can find this episode on a DVD collection of Sifl & Olly episodes.
