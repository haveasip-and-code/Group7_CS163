Zone 12
Brighton, a city in Sussex, UK. London's transport network is divided into concentric doughnut zones, numbered from 1 outwards to 6. Brighton is nicknamed 'Zone 12' because, although it is 50 miles (80 km) from London it's fruity, urban culture and fast trains to London have turned it into a virtual part of London.
