Teaneck
Teaneck is a town in northern New Jersey, and is a few miles away from New York City. The town is split into 5 sections by an invisible border. There's the Mexican side of town, the redneck side of town, the Black section, the average income black/white section, The Jewish section, and the really really Jewish section. Despite its diversity the town is run entirely by Jews, and school will always be closed on Jewish holidays.
