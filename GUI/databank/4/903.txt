the vines
A grungy garage band from Australia, performing and supporting artists before coming into their own with the release of Highly Evolved in 2002. This achieved some measure of mainstream success with their song 'Get Free'. ; A few MTV appearances later, they disappeared from the mainstream, much to the relief of some of their fans who were NOT 14 year old girls just jumping in on the new rock group. ; A second album, Winning Days, followed in 2004. This achieved very limited sales, and later in the same year Craig Nicholls, the frontman, assaulted a photographer. This caused the band's public image to collapse (obviously the public feels that rock stars should be polite and well-mannered). Nicholls was later diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a form of Autism. ; Despite now being virtually docile, the band's musical talent cannot be denied.
