Jassim Alajmi
an insensitive prick that teaches Banking and Finance courses at the University of Bahrain.He likes torturing students by preparing really tough exam questions which only he can answer.He also likes showing-off when someone asks him a question about something and acts least concerned about his students problems.I mean what the fuck is he trying to prove??? That he has the power to get us difficult exams or he wants to prove that he's a real genius??? ; NOTE: Jassim Alaji loves to use the word 'MA3GOOLA' in most of his sentences.So dont be surprised if you see them in every example.
