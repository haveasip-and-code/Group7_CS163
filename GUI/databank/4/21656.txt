Portland
The nicest city In the United States. Lots to do for active Liberal minded outdoor folk. Laid back atomosphere. Much better than Vancouver BC or Seattle. Those two cities are rude and filled with thugs and drugs and annoying folk. Especially Vancouver, My HOME. I would like to relocate in Portland some day in the future.
