vocal gymnastics
A style of singing in current popular music, specifically R&B, where the singer incorporates a lot of 'runs' and extra notes to showcase their vocal abilities, resulting in the singer looking like he/she is trying too hard to sound super-talented. Often accompanied by dramatic hand movements in synch with the notes being sung.
