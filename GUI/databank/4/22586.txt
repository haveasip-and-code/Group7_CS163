asexual reproduction
often confused with [autosexual reproduction] ; in asexual reproduction only one organism, which is neither male nor feamale, is involved. the organism reproduces either by ; 1. fission, litterally spliting itself in half to create two organisms. (imagine having yourself ripped in half, and then each half growing back the half it is missing) ; or ; 2. budding, where the new organism starts of as a growth on the side of the original organism. (like having a little man grow out of you're ass cheek, a little man that is exactly like you)
