Pong party
1) A gathering of men (mostly married, mostly old enough to vaguely remember the original [Pong]) for the purposes of drinking heavily and playing videogames (of the modern PS2/Xbox variety, not ACTUALLY Pong). ; 2) The extension of this gathering to include other fun, errr, boorish activities such as viewing of pornography and/or visiting of strip clubs. ; 3) See #2 above, except without videogames and with women instead of men, clothing optional. (Hypothetical.)
