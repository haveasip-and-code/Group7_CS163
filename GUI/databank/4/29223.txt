poland
A country in central europe (not eastern like someone said). Surrounded by Germany to the west, the Czech republik and Slovakia to the South, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, and Russia to the East. An ancient country founded in the middle 10th century by the Piast dynasty. Was one the the richest and biggest countries in europe after it merged with Lithuania, had the first ministry of education (ministy isn't the word I'm looking for), some of the first universities in europe, the second constitution (after the U.S), the first somewhat democratic system, great cavalry troops, but got partitioned due to interna conflics. Regaines it's independence in 1918, only to be invaded by Germany and Russia soon after (Poland actually propesed to attack Germany with France, but France backed out). After that it was made into a soviet satelite, until it rebelled and was made into a democratic republic. The communist hurt the economy making Poland significantly poorer than western europe, but improved education and other things. In the 1990s Poland improved it's economy, and prepared to joined the European Union. Poland joined the E.U in 2004. The current president is a former commie, and not that great. Poland is a very beatiful country, and I'm not just saying that, I'm from Poland and I've traveled to other countries. Beautiful cities- Krakow, Zakopane, Gdansk, Sopot, Kolobrzeg, etc. I am from Chorzow, which is pretty nice and has a huge park. The girls are pretty hot, and there aren't as many fat people as there are in America. Having lived there and in the United States, I can say that I would rather live in Poland. And one more thing- Polish people aren't stupid. Schools are much harder in Poland, and we generally think of Americans as stupid. Here are some random facts- there aren't a lot of black people in Poland, there are a lot of trams, cars are cheap, gas is not, education is free.
