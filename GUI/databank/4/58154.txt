diet dirt (DD)
We often hear of 'dirt' in the context of 'gossip' or interesting yet trivial facts about other people's lives. In the gay world, sharing 'the dirt' seems to be an important pasttime. In fact, 'dirt' has become some of a commodity to be shared. But to get 'dirt' one has to 'give dirt' or 'share dirt.' For the past 20 years, my gay friends when they feel they are not getting the full information (411) from one their friends, often restrict the flow of information to that friend, hence placing that person on the diet dirt plan or DD.
