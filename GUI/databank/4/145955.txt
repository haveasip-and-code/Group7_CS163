The Bumblebeez 81 are a hip-hop/rock group from Australia. They were formed by Chris Colonna and his sister Pia, who uses the stage name Queen Vila. Chris produces the band's beats on a computer. He usually sings while his sister sometimes raps. They have made one album, The Printz, which was also released in the U.S. The video for their single, 'Pony Ride', was somewhat successful. They are sometimes referred to as a cross between [Beck] and the [Beastie Boys].
