waimi
A thread on a messageboard that had a good intention, but was eventually hijacked and turned into a post pumping palace. ; Waimi has its origins in the spring of 2004 when an individual by the name of NeoChrist, at a Tool messageboard posted a thread entitled 'Why are introverts more intelligent?'. After about 2 pages of serious discussion, forum trolls hijacked it, and 40 pages later the thread was locked.
