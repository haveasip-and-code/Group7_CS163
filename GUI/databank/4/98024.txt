A.C.
<abbreviation> ; 1) ; Electronics; Alternating Current; ; A current which follows the pattern of a Sine wave. The voltage increases, reaches a peak, dips, goes into the negative, reaches a trough, curves up again back through 0 Volts into positive. ; A.C. is used as a mains voltage supply because it can be efficiently stepped up and down from the power plant and can be transported through relatively small cables across the country due to the current being stepped down and the voltage increased to around 270kV so you get the same power, but you dont need huge cables.
