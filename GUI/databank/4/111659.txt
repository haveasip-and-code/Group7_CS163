Jew
A Jewish person is a person of the Jewish decent and are just like everyone else except they are better because they are related to Moses. Jewish people are some of the most wonderful, nice, respectful, sympathetic, and just kind people you will ever meet. I pity those who are so pissed off and feel so ordinary that they need to make themselves feel better by hating us!
