Kentucko Hut
One of the fine establishments run by Tri-Con, a Pepsi Co. spin off. Contains a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a Pizza Hut, and a Taco Bell all under one roof, allowing visitors the dubious pleasure of eating nachos, potato wedges, and pizza all in one meal. A slightly more evolved form of a [taco hut] or a [pizza bell] and related to the emerging [KFCANW].
