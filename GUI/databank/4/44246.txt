politics
One big mid-life crisis in which rich, balding middle-aged men compete for the approval of their nation in order to distract themselves from the fact that they are over the hill with no way of going back as they quickly tumble towards their death. The winner ends up in office being used as a puppet for his party to push their agenda while the loser retires to mediocrity and Rogaine.
