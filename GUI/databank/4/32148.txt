ocarina
A small instrument that plays mostly like a flute. Link in Zelda: Ocarina of time used one for various reasons. Real ocarinas are only a few inches long, but still can create a tapestry of beautiful music. There's also an online store where you can get your own ocarina called www.songbirdocarina.com
