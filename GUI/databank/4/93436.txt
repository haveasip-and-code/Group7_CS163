hughesville
A small, dirty, 99.9% white town in northcentral [pennsylvania] where everyone knows everyone else, girls are pregnant by the age of 13, and where the stupid people stay to exponentially increase the amount of ignorance over time whereas all of people who are not parasites of society leave.
