purikura
Japanese photo booths called 'Print Club.' For about three dollars you print out a sheet of sixteen small stickers with your photo on it, with crazy or cute borders and cartoon images (aka Hello kitty.) ; VERY popular in Japan and it's catching on here too. Sticker picture booths are available in most mall arcades.
