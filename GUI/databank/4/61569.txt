dumpster diver
'Dumpster' is tacked on to the word 'diver.' A 'diver' is short for 'muff diver.' When one adds 'dumpster' to it, then the conotation is obvious: someone is diving into a cavernous, dirty, nasty ... cavity. But take the origin of 'Dumpster!' Usually it has 'cum' in front of it (as in 'cum dumpster'). So now we can think of an alternate definition as having to do with sloppy seconds, or thirds ... or more. When 'diving' in this manner, there is usually an echo and vile residue involved.
