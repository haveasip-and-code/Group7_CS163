Fayetteville  NC
Known for the incredibly large numbers of military men and women, Fayetteville is the 4th largest city in North Carolina, behind Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro and Winston-Salem. In every place you go, you will most likely find a G.I. or two in there with you. As in every town you have the cultured members that went to Terry Sanford High School and Fayetteville Academy, and as you span outward you encounter more and more of those who have graduated but have yet to get to college. Although Fayetteville has much to offer for any family, the life it provides for an upcoming professional lacks sensibility and fun.
