Des Moines
The capital city of Iowa, also the largest city in Iowa with a metro population of about a half mil (not huge but good sized for the midwest). Contrary to popular belief, not a bad city, ranked #4 for quality of life in the US. Only really bad part is Des Moines is over 80% white, so it's not very 'hip.'
