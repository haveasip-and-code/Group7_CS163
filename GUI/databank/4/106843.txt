Barnsley
In the UK. South Yorkshire to be precise. ; Full of inbreds who used to work down t'pit. ; Reckons rolls are called teacakes and seems to have an unhealthy obsession with their home town. ; They have big gates of Barnsley which are supposedly designed to welcome travellers home. I think it is more likely to keep everybody else out. ; Barnsley is a LOT like Royston Vasey from The League of Gentlemen.
