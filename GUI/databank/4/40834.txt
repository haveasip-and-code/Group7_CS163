schootching
The act of schootching is unique to beautiful princesses and cheeky norrells. It is an intimate act of closeness, in no way 'playa-like' and requires co-operation of both parties. ; Norrells will never schootch with anyone other than princesses, certainly not randoms. ; Some people compare schootching with cootching, but its far better. ; Often people cootch for the sake of it, especially males, and usually they count down while doing this, generally for a period of 20 seconds or less. ; Schootching on the otherhand is not limited by time, as Norrells are (secretly) sensitive people, happy to schootch wherever, whenever, and for however long princesses like.
