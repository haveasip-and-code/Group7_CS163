Crystal Maze
The act of pushing [Cocaine] into someone's arse hole and then getting them to fart to the [coke] into your face. The idea is to sniff and chase all of the airbourne [cocaine] before it settles. The phrase comes from the UK game show 'The Crystal Maze' in which, during the last challenge, contestants chase lots of airboure tickets whilst inside a dome to see how many they can grab.
