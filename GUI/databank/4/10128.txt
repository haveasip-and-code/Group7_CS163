Delaware
I just want to quote something from #2 and clarify it: ; 'Cost of living is high, since the state needs to make revenue somehow (no sales tax really hurts).' ; You need to check your facts. Have you compared it to PA and NJ? I didn't think so. Insurance is chaper, property taxes are cheaper, and I can get somewhat of a nice house for $250,000. Try finding a house in the PA or Jersey that isn't a shack or a trailer for that.
