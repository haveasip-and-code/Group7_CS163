Barry Cooper
Philosophy & outlook on life propagated by 'Barry Cooper' (1979-) Appauling English school child, who fought bullying with the thick skin of sycophancy. Essentially a defeatingly derivative opinion on anything even vaguely populist (that's any good). Exposure to 'Barry Cooper' results in an irrational and delusional hatred of the subject in question (that's any good).
