catholicism
im gonna sound really bad when i say this, but i will say what i must. Though the catholic church is amongst the oldest forms of christian belief, it is also the most tainted and dark form. Not the Orthodox catholic, but the roman catholic (sorry!). It was because of the Roman Catholic church, that thousands of Native American tribes went extinct. It also lead to the enslavement of blacks and the colonization of the Orient. Soon, the will to spread the word of God became malevolent will and avarice. Also, the Roman Catholic church praises the pope as God's interpreter, no man can choose for the world the meaning of the scripitures, no matter how pure he is...
