plugged in
Plugged In (pluggedinonline.com) is a subdivision of the Christian organization Focus on the Family. Plugged In Online offers reviews on movies, music, DVD releases, and television shows, as well as some book reviews and commentaries on the national media. ; The loudmouths who have established the fundamentalist Christian/Republican stereotype in America (and indeed, across the pond as well). A large percentage of 'Christian' families/individuals will follow the pedagogues that head both Focus on the Family and Plugged In like sheep to the slaughter. They should not be taken as the sentiment or opinion of regular, individual Christians, many whom go unheard due to the infernal roar created by the tirades of this organization. ; However, Plugged In is usually distributed around the Internet as a good place to go to get a laugh, whether you're Christian or not, since even members of one group are allowed to laugh at the crazies. ; In short, Plugged In has served merely to give the non-fundamentalist Christians a bad name, and have become the laughingstock of many a forum and blog.
