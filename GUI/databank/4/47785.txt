Idolo
A highly rare species of a deer. Among some of its characteristics you may find an exceptional intelligence, an exrtaordinary capability to analyze situations (sometimes used for its benefit, sometimes might harm it), and a developed sense of humor. ; I've met only one in my life, and therefore I can't tell if this character is mutual to all: Breathtaking Beauty. ; They seem to have talking eyes, stunning eye lashes, masculine yet boyish features and beautifully thin lips. ; Thier skin is like an endless desert - and when you look at it, you immediately sense this spin of nature's infinity. ; They are very active, therefore thier bodies are built splendidly. ; The Idolos are highly intimate, cherich thier families and known for having a great sense of morality. ; They seem to have some strong connection to a specific flower. It is important to mark that thier nutrition is totally vegan, therefore it is still a mystery how come they protect this certain flower (which is called [ayula]) and eat all others.
