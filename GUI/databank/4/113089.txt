olive soup
'Olive soup' is a term recently coined as symbolism of the words '[I love you]' in that, if spoken, it forms the same mouth patterns as such. Often it is used by those who feel the current situation may not be appropriate for the statement 'I love you', but at the same point may wish to express this anyhow. ; Mostly used to keep those around the person(s) feeling comfortable, as expressions of love can make some feel squeamish.
