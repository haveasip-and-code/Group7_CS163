Linkin park.
One of the latest pop sensations. Linkin park are not dissimilar to other boy bands like the backstreet boys. All of their songs are about their parents in one way or another and how they are so angry at them. Their genre has been called such things as rock metal rap ect, however they have started a reasonably new genre called [angry parent rock] because all they do is scream about their parents. ; The fans of these bands 14 year old skanks and boys of all ages because they think its hardcore alternative shit. In defense of liking this utter tripe they say things like 'each to their own' and 'if you don't like it shut the fuck up' This is expected from Linkin Park fans because it is generic and they have no mind of their own just like the band they blindly worship.
