jazzy bummer
Someone who has lots of money, too much to know how to spend it wisely, and who wears rugy shirts with their collar turned up, their trousers high up round their waist and boat shoes. They also drink lager and on occasion pour it over their heads when they've consumed too much. Also known as (rugger buggers) who say rah rah rah alot.
