Bitch-bag
This word came from a misunderstanding between my Wife and Myself. One day while putting the groceries away, I asked her where the milk was. She replied 'it's in the bag'! There were at least 10 bags and I said 'Which Bag'? She came around the corner and said 'What did you call me'? I said 'nothing, I asked 'which bag''! We both laughed because she thought I had called her a 'Bitch-Bag'.
