Dennis Hastert
The current house speaker (R-Ill). Not previously defined in the Urban Dictionary since he is generally such a quiet and un-noticed political entity. Unlike such prior falmboyant figures as Newt Gingrich and other republican gems who have crashed and burned, he accomplishes approximately as much without being noticed...a rather huge accomplishment in the field of politics.
