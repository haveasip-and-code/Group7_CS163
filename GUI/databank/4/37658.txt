Alice In Chains
Fuck Nirvana. That's right, fuck Kurt Cobain. Fuck 'Nevermind', fuck the baby, fuck Teen Spirit. AIC kicks Nirvana's ass. Let's see you compare, let's say, Polly to Rooster. Let's see you compare Lithium to Man In The Box. Talk to me about music after you've made those comparisons. I guess, theoretically, you could compare Facelift to Bleach, but there is no comparison in my eyes. Dirt to Nevermind... fuckin' kiddin' me?
