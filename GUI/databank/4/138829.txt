Jeep Confidence
The confidence one obtains by driving in a Jeep when you normally lack that in an everyday social setting. The biggest losers can ride in a Jeep and still obtain coolness just by the Jeep association. Giving the Jeep wave, head nod, and smile to passing Jeeps also helps you gain that extra cool confidence one normally lacks.
