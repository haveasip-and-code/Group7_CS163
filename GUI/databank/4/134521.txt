dirty hippie
A 'dirty hippie' is more than likely a 'neo hippie.' They usually have dirty dreads, IF THEY ARE NOT A POSER..They probably dig on the Grateful Dead, Phish, and other cool jam bands. Some are artists. Some are strictly drug users. Some are homeless. Some have Jobs...BUT MOSTLY THEY HAVE SHIRTS THAT CAN STAND UP BY THEMSELVES AFTER PHISH TOUR..Patchouli sadly doesnt cover everything up
