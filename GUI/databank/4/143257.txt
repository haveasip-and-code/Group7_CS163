Seven of Nine
Character in Star Trek: Voyager played by Jeri Ryan from 1997-2001. She used to be a Borg, but The Doctor got rid of a lot of her implants. However, she was assimilated as a little girl, so parts of her Borg physiology weren't removable. She's usually seen on Voyager walking around in a grey catsuit and having entire episodes about her 'developing her humanity'. Concidered by most to be the sexiest character in Star Trek: Voyager, the web is now littered with naked pictures of her.
