g-unit
G-Unit is a poor excuse for rap music. ; Whoever said they were the best rap group on def. number 1 obviously doesn't know or understand what rap is. ; This 'rap' group is lead by 50 Cent. ; A man who repeatedly wants to tell us he got shot 9 times (when what he really needs to do is quit acting like a wannabe G and take care of his fucking kid.)Other members consist of Tony Yayo who wants to tell us his very hard life in prison, and how this girl is so seductive when she was dancing on him, the way she was moving it was making him horny. <These are some of the lyrics to the new G-Unit/Tony Yayo song 'So Seductive.' ; Whoever in the fuck calls this song rap is retarded.Then we have some decent members such as Lloyd Banks, who is (THANK GOD) a non-fake.Game was also part of G-Unit once but he realized how shitty and fake and non-rap G-Unit was. ; See [fake]
