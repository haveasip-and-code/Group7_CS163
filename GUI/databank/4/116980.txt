Boonsboro
Town in [Washington County], [Maryland], that no one knows, nor wants to know. Astonishingly undiverse and uncultured, the town consists of townies, rednecks, kids, seniors, and the random minority who got lost trying to find [Montgomery County]. ; Seeing as there's nothing to do in this small town, most kids find themselves using drugs, drinking alcohol and spending large amounts of time in sister towns [Frederick] and [Hagerstown] where there is still nothing left to do but mingle with the locals at the Valley Mall. ; If you are rich in Boonsboro, you are still poor in most other parts of Maryland. ; Boonsboro High School is the school where most unfortunate students have to go. Here, students will recieve a poor education, witness numerous fights and be taught by old geriatrics who should have retired already. The high school consists of about 40% rednecks, 15% goths, 15% nerds, 25% potheads and 5% smart preppy kids who wished they grew up somewhere else. ; If you go to Boonsboro High, you will be encouraged to spend your life milling around on the farm, or attending [Hagerstown Community College]. Even though it is the state school, most kids aren't even intelligent enough to get accepted to [UMD], and most find themselves at [Towson], [Frostburg], [JMU], or [Salisbury]. If you are one of the few who go to an out of state college, expect to be returning to MD soon. ; Overall, Boonsboro is a fun place to live during high school until you graduate and realize that the world is so much better pretty much anywhere else.
