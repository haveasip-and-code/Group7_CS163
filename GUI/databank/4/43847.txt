subaru driver
a lesbian. ; Subaru's early 90's campaign slogan 'It's Not A Choice, It's The Way We're Built,' was specifically targeted towards the U.S. gay community. Subaru has been so successful at attracting gay customers that some drivers consider themselves members of a 'club,' in which fellow Subaru owners share an implied message behind their cars' brand. ; For several years, Subaru advertising has targeted gays, partially through its support of the Rainbow Card program, a Visa card that generates money to support AIDS research and other gay-related causes.
