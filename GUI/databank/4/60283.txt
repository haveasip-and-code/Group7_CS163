BabyGoth
A youngling- usually still fourteen and at the pretentious stage, before they grow up and realise that you don't have to lie and agnst to impress the older ones. usually about 14, the size of a large teddy-bear, and still care about what others think, no matter how they deny it. ; Many never grow out of it. They're funny, mainly because they're obviously bored and boring.
