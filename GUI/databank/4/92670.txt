cockadile
1. A rare species of crocodile, that was shaped like a penis. It has been reported that the species is gay, as their method of breeding is by headbutting each other, which is probably why they are almost, if not already, extinct. Which brings up the question of how did they get here in the first place? ; 2. A weak insult often referring that he's 'gay' (not literally in most cases).
