nigger chaser
A [bottle rocket], minus the wooden stick to hold it up. When lit off, the [firecracker] takes off in a random direction, and follows an unpredictable trajectory. The term 'nigger chaser' is a nickname given to the bottle rocket in the early 40's. The reason this nickname was chosen can be left to the spectator's imagination.
