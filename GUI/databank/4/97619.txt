puta persa
derogatory term used to describe a woman who wears too much perfume, usually the cheap kind. It is also insulting because it implies that she needs to wear this much perfume due to her 'enthusiastic' sex life and partners and it is also racist since it describes the woman as one of Persian origina. Literally translates to 'Persian Whore', often heard in Hispanic countries.
