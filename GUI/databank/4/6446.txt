Alabama
A State and State of Mind - and some might say a Black Sucking Hole. Born & raised... I then managed to escape for 20 years. Later I somehow got sucked back down to Dixie for what was supposed to be temporary... that was 5 years ago (Bama years = dog years, so that's 35 actually). It has beautiful country, ocean, flat lands, mountains, waterfalls, etc. And even FREE thinkers but only in Birmingham on the Southside. Politically the state is firmly in the hands of the GOP. White democrats (aka Dixiecrats) rushed like lemmings from the Democratic side to the Republican as a result of the GOP's rhetoric on states rights. By capitalizing on white fear, they successfully rode the civil rights movement in the 50s and 60s to victory. In Alabama, it being the BUCKLE of the Bible Belt, there are many puritanical religious zealots that think Bill Clinton put an x-ray vision satellite in space that flies over every night and counts their guns. No lie... there are those who wrap their pistols in aluminum foil so they won't get counted.
