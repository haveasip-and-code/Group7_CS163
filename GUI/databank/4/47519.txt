emo child
Someone who thinks their emo but, in truth, is a complete wannabe emo poser. Always wears jeans and black shirts and listens to bands that aren't actually emo such as Green Day. Calls everybody else posers and tells people to 'leave emo to the emo kids'. Hangs out with people from other towns because no one in her own likes them and is only in 8th grade. Knows all the words to songs such as Jesse McCartney's 'Beautiful Soul' and Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone'.
