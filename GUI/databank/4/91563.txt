king of crunk
A term applied to a Spring Breaker by a fellow Spring Breaker, under the heavy influence of rum and vodka. Funny at the time as a joke, the term is often taken a bit too seriously by individuals who still use it to insult the Spring Breaker in question 12 months later. ; Generally speaking, the person dubbed 'King of Crunk' does not actually believe he can drink more than anyone else, although he admittedly is attracted to middle school girls. Moreover, the person jokingly dubbed King of Crunk will often sit and ponder why individuals spend Thursday evenings dwelling on Spring Break rather than going out and--yes--getting crunked.
