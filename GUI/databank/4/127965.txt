Stokey Cokey
Regional variation of the popular playground game the 'Hokey Cokey'. ; A large mound of cocaine is formed on the ground, which is typically achieved by the participating children pooling their stashes. ; The players then form a ring around the pile of charlie and chant 'Ohhhh, the Stokey Cokey', while holding hands and rhythmically centring in and out on the drug. ; Whenever the players are in proximity of the mound, they are encouraged to snuffle as much chalk as possible before the ring expands outside of reach. ; Not to be confused with the 'Cokey Stokey', a similar game usually played by the upper classes, in which a drug addled man from Stoke is placed in the centre of the group and taunted by similar chants and motions.
