Pit burger
A cheap Hamburger stand with locations in Allentown, PA. The burgers are like 8 for $1 and unacceptable for human consumption and most likely made of homeless people and opossum meat. The french fries are as thin and greasy, kind of like the employee's hair. Better usage for the food includes using to level furniture, throwing at fat people (they sometimes pick it up and eat it) and using as mail (people love to find this shit in their mailboxes, i think).
