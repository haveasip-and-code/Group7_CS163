Skimming
Short for 'skimboarding', the sport of running and jumping on a specially made board and skimming over the surface of the water (usually at the beach). The 2 types of skimming are: ; - Sandskimming - ; Done by skimming parallel to the beach across a thin layer of water, usually on a sandbar or other flat area. Almost all skimmers start this way, although there's lots of room for expertise with advanced sandskimming tricks. ; - Wave-riding - ; With wave riding you start higher on the beach, and run down the slope hopefully getting on your board before the shoal drops off. From there you ride out to a wave, carve into it and ride it in, performing your bag of tricks along the way.
