Unearth
A seriously [hardcore] band with a pension for destruction. Their 2004 release of 'The Oncoming Storm' completely took everyone by surprise. Basically unheard of in most mainstream circles, Unearth has become a potent and wicked [hardcore] band with a serious sense of timing, rhythm and musical talent. ; Most of their lyrics pertain to the War in Iraq, capitolism, and [George W. Bush]. ; Check them out, you won't be disappointed.
