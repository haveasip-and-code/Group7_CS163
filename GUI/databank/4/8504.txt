bendable
Bendable is an adjective that is usually used by males (guys) to describe a chick they feel is good enough to have sex with. Being bendable doesn't necessarily make a chick hot. Being bendable just means that, if you asked or if the guy got the chance, he would [bone] you. So, in a sense, if you are not 'bendable' you must be pretty ugly or messed up.
