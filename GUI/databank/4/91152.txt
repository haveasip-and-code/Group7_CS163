Ted Kennedy
The senator of Massachusetts. He is a worthless $hitbag who doesn't deserve to clean bathrooms at McFaty's, but still goes there to eat every day for 4 of his meals(He goes to Cholesterol King for his other 3). He hates Bush because he's jealous that people don't hate him as much. He's worse then John Kerry. His father was involved in international crime and his brother(not John) was a womanizer. And you just thought it couldn't get any worse? He also muderred his wife while he was drunk, but nobody pressed charges. And finally, to top it all off, THIS ASSHOLE JUST WON'T DIE! You can put a bullet through his skull and he still is going to live to torture the city of Boston.
