lolicon
Lolicon is the word to describe person who likes, or have lust over female children. Age range varies by individual. The most accurate age range is between 1 years old to 12 years old. ; The word lolicon originated in japanese language by combining two words: Lolita and Complex. The word Lolita itself comes from a novel written by Vladimir Nabokov in 1955. Lolita is both the name of the novel itself anf the name of a main heroine. The novel is about obsession of middle-aged intellectual with 12-year old girl named 'Lolita' (so the most accurate age range as said above should be ~12). ; Originally the word Lolita has no meaning, but later it means Young Girls (age range as said above). By combining the word Lolita and Complex it should be Lolicom, but as in japanese language which the word 'Lolicon' originated from does not have the 'M' sound. As the result, combined word is Lolicon. ; Lolicon and pedophile have almost the same meaning, but the western adapted lolicon mostly count only person who is obbessed with drawings of female children, when in japanese it count both real female children and drawings of female children.
