Bathurst
A place in Australia, NSW. Also the location of Mt. Panorama, the place where the Bathurst Race Track is located. The races held here are commonly between the Holden and Ford V8 Supercars and it is a sacred event in Australia. The race has been rightfully dominated by the Holden Commodores for the past 15 years. This is because the Holden Commodore is a superior car with superior drivers. The phrase 'take it to bathurst' is often used by Holden drivers during street races against Fords to rub in the fact that Fords are crap and cant win anything. Said right before the start of the race.
