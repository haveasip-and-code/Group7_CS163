The Coffee Seesaw
An oldskool dance. To preform the coffee seesaw, one must take their arms and bend them approximatly 90 degrees at the elbow out in front of their person. Cup the hands as if you were grasping piping hot coffees. Then, in an alternating fashon, move one arm up, and one down. Repeat. Congratgulations, you have just done the Coffee Seesaw!
