FOX Paradox
Describing the ironic situation of the FOX media corporation, which owns both FOX and FOX News. ; The FOX television network is infamous for producing 'morally questionable' television programs that often depict sexuality, violence, and anti-conservative themes (ie. dysfunctional families, drug use, gays/lesbians). ; At the same time, the FOX News network is infamous for their blatant support of the socially conservative right wing. The right wing includes groups such as the PTC (Parents Television Council), which filed more than 95% of indecency complaints to the FCC. ; This is known as the FOX paradox.
