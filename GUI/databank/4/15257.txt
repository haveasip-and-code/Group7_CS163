Old Lady
While the above definions are true, they're only limited to certian areas in USA or Canada. The universal term, or definition, of an Old Lady is simply an old lady, mostly found in ghettos, who are always calling the cops. 99% of the time they're white, and 60% of the time are single. They believe that calling the cops will solve everything.
