g unit!
A terrible clothing line started by 50 cent to promote his rap crew 'gorilla unit'. You can find it at Ross Dress For Less and Marshalls on the oversized rack. The style follows in the tradition of FUBU, Sean John, Mecca, Kani, Phat Farm and RocaWear. Not to be mistaken for WuWear, which is actually hot apparel.
