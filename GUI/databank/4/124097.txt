ghetto potomac
The part of Potomac where houses may sell for a million dollars but they aren't mansions. The part of Potomac where not all houses have at least 3 car garages. The part of Potomac that includes Beverly Farms Elementary. The part of Potomac where there are no rich-ass jappy bitches and preppy jocks. The chill part of Potomac.
