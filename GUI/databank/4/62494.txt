Beasteroni
Quite possible the best tasting food ever made. A combo of Beast and ER and oni. Very spiceeey and very, very good to taste it. Usually sold by the mil it cost over $76,544,4,54 for an once. This stuff ain't cheap and it ain't bad either. Some say it tastes like a cum rag, others say it tastes like a rag filled with dead babies, but who's to judge. It is sold only at Safeway, but you have to ask the manager to get it for you b/c they keep it locked up. If you ever, ever get a chance to try some, DON'T turn it down. You'll kill yourself later.
