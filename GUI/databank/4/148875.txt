Mystic Runner
1. The name giving to the legendary person that is often seen sprinting around the UK - England more the most. ; No one knows who this person is, it just 'mystically runs' passed at random times, too quick for you to see him (legend has it that it is a male - apparently) ; Some have heard it cry out strange noises and cries. For example: 'oooooooorly' ; This could be some sort of distress call or perhaps a mating call to his true love - who, as legend has it, is the reason this person is running around the country. ; 2. One that runs in a mystical or stealthy manner
