atp synthase
A large enzyme found on the inner mitachondrial membrane and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. has a rotating central stalk powered by chemiosmosis of protons. The rotation causes conformational changes of the enzyme moving the alpha and beta subunits relative to one another synthesising atp from adp and inorganic phosphate.
