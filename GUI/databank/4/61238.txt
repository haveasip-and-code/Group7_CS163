electrikk
Really annoying and gay trend, a cousin of emo, fashioncore, and hardcore, mostly on myspace '&&' xanga. Basically fashioncore, but 'electrikks' guys and gals have an obsession with dinosaurs, even tho thats really gay because dinosaurs dont exist. Ambulances, car crashes, and guns are also part of their obsession. These 'electrikk' people are usually chubby, just the way it is. They listen to bands such as my chemical romance, the used, because it is the 'cool' thing to do. By the way, your not electrikk, (thats not even the way you spell it, its electric), your vibrator is.
