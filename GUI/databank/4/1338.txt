American Football
A sport similar in origin to Rugby. As an American, I've played both, and they're both good sports. Football is a complicated game, but here are some examples of rules: ; 11 men on the field at a time (on offense, you need at least 7 people on the line of scrimmage, and a Quarterback to receive the snap to start every play). ; Players on offense are broken down into many positions, the main ones are Quarterback, Running back, Full back, Wide Receiver, Tight End, Tackle, Guard, Center. ; Players on defense are broken down into 3 levels, Linemen, Linebackers, Defensive Backs. Lineman normally consist of Ends and Tackles. Linebackers usually consist of Inside and Outside Linebackers. Defensive backs usually consist of Cornerbacks and Safeties. ; Teams also use kickers and punters on special teams. ; The object of football is to advance the ball downfield by passing and running. ; There are multiple ways to score, touchdowns (6 points), Point After Conversions (1 point), 2-point conversions (2 points), Field Goals (3 points), and Safeties (2 points). ; A touchdown occurs when the ball is advanced to the endzone. After this, a team can elect to kick a point after conversion, or run a play from 2 yards out to try to pick up 2 points. ; A Field Goal occurs when a team kicks the ball through the uprights. ; A Safety occurs when the defensive team tackles the ball carrier inside their own endzone. ; The field is 100 yards long. ; The current World Champs are the New England Patriots, though the Indianapolis Colts look the strongest thus far in the season.
