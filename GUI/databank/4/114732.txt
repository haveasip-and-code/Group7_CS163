Edmonton
Edmonton is the capital of Alberta in Canada. It is now the murder capital of Canada, and also has the highest crime rate in Canada. And i live here, what a fuckin waste of land it is! About a million people, more with all of its boroughs like St. Albert and Sherwood Park. Nice skyline. The nice areas are few, but they are mostly around the Riverbend district in the now joined former city of Strathcona and on the far western edge the now joined former city of Jasper Place... But there's too much bad shit... in other places... the ghetto is the entire lower northeast, stretching across the subway / above ground train line to areas like Belvedere and Highlands and Abbotsfield and Boyle/McCauley. Theres so much fucking gangs its crazy, the main ones that are bad and fighting each other right now are the mostly black Bloods and the mostly native Alberta Warriors. Theres like a fucking shooting a day here. it sux, yes it does... do something about it...
