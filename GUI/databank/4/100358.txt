Back office monkey
B.O.M for short. An employee of a financial service firm who pushes paper ie: does cost accounting, settles accounts, etc. This employee thinks that by becoming a Chartyred Financial Analyst, they will move to a more glamorous front office position and make more money. B.O.M's are easily placated by free donuts or pizza.
