its your birthday
Used by rappers and dorky white kids, [its your birthday] means that you have completed something and your friends (if you have any) and proud of you, resulting in them saying 'its your birthday' meaning 'Congrats! You've done some ordinary thing that many other people do, but I'm going to use the phrase 'its your birthday' to sound cool, and hip, because I saw it on MTV!!!!' ; Yeah.
