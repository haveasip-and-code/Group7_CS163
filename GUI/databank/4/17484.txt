Wonko the sane
If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David Bowies on top of the other David Bowie, then attached another David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the first two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a dirty beach robe you would hten have something which didn't exactly look like John Watson, but which those who knew him would find hauntingly familiar. ; John 'Wonko The Sane' Watson is tall and gangly. ; He lives in an inside-out house overlooking the Pacific Ocean. That is, to visit you park on the carpet. There's a sign on the wall that reads, 'Come Outside.' He considers the rest of the world to be 'The Asylum,' because it seemed to him that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a package of toothpicks was no longer a civilization in which he could live and stay sane. ; Wonko knows more about the dolphins than any other human being alive.
