lightning rod
During long road trips, you may come across (or rather, they'll come across you) a lightning rod. It is basically a car which has one goal on the highway... to keep in the triple digits MPH. You'll discover them most likely riding your tail if your in the left lane. ; The purpose of a lightning rod is to let them go. Chances are, you aren't obeying the speed limit either and, on a long road trip, you'll want to be pushing around 80. [Police fundraiser]s on the side of the highway will catch this guy first. Lightning rods will eventually leave the highway or disappear into the horizon, and [ghost car]s might creep up on you.
