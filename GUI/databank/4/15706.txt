Indy
Indy is short for Independent. Such as Independent film, Independent music, Independent wrestling, ect. Indy is usually an acronymn for low budget films. Some may use it for music (see underground for independant music) or wrestling, but not often. Becuase if used more often for other things such as music or wrestling the term becomes to close to Indy racing. So the term Indy manly shows up more with term 'Indy Films' or 'Indy Movie.'
