shartburn
a rare and tragic combination of gastrointestinal malfunctions resulting in an embarrasing release of gasseos effluvia and inadvertantly, solid shite (a [shart]), which, due to the recent consumption of spicy food, simultaneously leads to a distressingly painful case of [hotring]. A lethal and humiliating combination.
