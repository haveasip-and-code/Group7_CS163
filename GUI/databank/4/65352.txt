Red States
The best places in the United States that make up over half of the nation's total population as well as around 3/4 of the country's total land mass. These particular states are filled with good people, usually who work for a living and get educations or they work hard to make something of themselves. There are a few ultra-liberal morons and ghetto-ass black people who hate whites, but overall it is the better people who have morals, a work ethic, care about their families, and defend their personal beliefs and will stand up for their president, or at least for their country.
