Generation X
A tech savvy generation with the unfortunate distinction of being born after the Boomer generation and thus having to suffer through the worse childhood of any generation. ; Generally, for those who survived being spoiled rotten or beaten by their parents, they became happy, outgoing, and very innovative. For those who had to fight their way out they became leaders, innovators, and strong willed. ; Criticized for being slackers but surviving the boomer generation would take the energy and initiative out of anybody.
