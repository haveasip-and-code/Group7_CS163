American Eagle
[American Eagle Outfitters] or [AE] sells highly trendy clothes targeted at the lucrative teenage population. [American Eagle's] clothing is usually (I'm saying usually because of course you have the girls who buy like a small when they are a large) less slutty than some of the items you would find at [Abercrombie]. [AE] is a great place to find stylish jeans and vintage tees. As an added bonus they always have a great sales rack!
