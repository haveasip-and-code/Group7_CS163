pantsing
pantsing is the act of letting the [pantsie] know that the showing of old, cheap, smelly underwear by wearing one's pants (bought at Big Lots or stolen from the laundromat) low on the hips offends a person or persons directly behind, to the point that the [pantser] feels a social and patriotic obligation to embarass the [pantsie] by pulling down the pants the rest of the way and letting the [pantsie] try to walk away without looking like a ruptured duck.
