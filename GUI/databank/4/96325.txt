tithe
Tithing is the act of giving 10% of one's income to the church. Churches don't force this upon the people, but it is encouraged. The Bible says that all of the money belongs to God, but He only wants the first 10%. Think of it this way, would you rather have 90% of your income blessed, or 100% of your income cursed? God blesses those that tithe to Him. I tithe and give an offering on top of the tithe, and I have more money than any of my friends that are my age. It's not because my family is rich (which it's not)but it's because I've been blessed by God.
