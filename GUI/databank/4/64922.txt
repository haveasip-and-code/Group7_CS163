Facts ; -Singer ; -Used to date Singer Eamon ; Story: ; Eamon's ex, broke up with Eamon. Eamon didn't take the break-up too well, so he wrote the oh-so popular Fuck you, you ho don't want you back, in which he calls her a ho, I don't want you back, burn in hell...death...don't drive your car to work, use your friends, etc. So Frankee rebutted the only way she knew how, which was writing her own song: F.U. Right Back, where she calls Eamon a bitch and questions his penis, etc. Well, even though their songs were intended for each other, they both became instantly popular, and now Frankee and Eamon both are big pop icons.
