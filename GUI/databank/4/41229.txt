Mega 64
A series about 2 teen agers captured by the evil Dr.Poque to beta test his sinister console the Mega 64. It basically downloads old games to a players brain, making the experience all to real. They are 2 guys running through Clafornia dresses up as video game charecters. Some examples are Ghost and Goblins, dig dug, tetris, and Banjo and Kazooie. It is fricken awesome, and asides from [red vs blue] and [lewis black] its the coolest thing ever.
