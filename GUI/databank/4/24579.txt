Catchphrase of a character from BBC Three's 'Little Britain' comedy series. Now annoyingly repeated ad infinitum by thousands of chav kids too stupid and unimaginative to come up with thier own comedy material, and usually sounding fuck all like it's meant to, therefore losing all hint of comedy merit shown in the original.
