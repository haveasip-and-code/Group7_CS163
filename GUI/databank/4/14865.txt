trivium
A kick ass band. Best songs 'pull harder on the strings of your matyr', 'like light to the flies' & 'Rain'. They are metal and harcore depending on the song. Instruments used: Gibson les paul custom, Jackson KV2, Bc rich custom mockingbird, Tama or Pearl drums with sabian cymbals. An amazing drummer!
