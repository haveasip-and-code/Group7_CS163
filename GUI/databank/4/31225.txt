teenie
annoying little people who decide a band is worthy of their time based on how much they want to get into the lead singers pants. They then bitch on said singer's spouse claiming that they are 'stealing there man', etc. ; If they have gotten to the obsessive stages, they may even take to giving they're 'beloved''s pet names, carrying little pictures in their wallets... etc. ; Teenies are astonishingly shallow creatures as they can manage all this without actually buying a single/album. And even if they did it would be to stroke the cover.
