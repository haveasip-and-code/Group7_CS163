Swat-A-Coon
A game played predominantly in the 1930's to 1940's, in which white young males would obtain a broom, a car, and commute to the closest ghetto. Upon arival they would attempt to use the broom to swat a coon (black male or female) while driving by. ; If the broom was dropped, the car would be stopped, and the swatter must then obtain the broom, typically leading to problems with the swatted coon.
