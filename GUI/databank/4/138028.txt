cockonics
1. The language of love, or sweet-talking some sweet young lady into your bed. A takeoff of the word 'ebonics' for inner-city speech. ; 2. The art of whipping out your cock to pick up a woman, satisfied that its sheer length and girth will win her over rather than conversation or spending an assload of money on the theater and an expensive dinner.
