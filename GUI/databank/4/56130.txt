soek
An organization of unknown workers, or agents, designed to implement security risks that disrupt the government somehow 'clearing the picture' for other departments/agencies/forces or sending in their own forces for exigent purposes. They also have a nationwide web of phone/webtaps, informants, spies and undercover guys ('plants'). Founded in 1988 with the purpose of fighting law more effectively nationwide, they eventually lasted through trying times such as 9/11 and continue their work today.
