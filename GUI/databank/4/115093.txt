super strat
A Super Strat is a guitar based on the Fender Stratocaster or [strat] for short, but which has extra features, usually in order to update the original design (which is obviously limited due the strat's 1954 introduction). Such updates as Double-Locking Floyd Rose tremolos, Humbucking Pickups, and different body woods are used to improve the playability, looks, and sound of the classic stratocaster design.
