Dean's Lister
A person who has no social life. He/she will give up going to hang out with friends to study for tests. Many believe they sleep with their Biology books. In school they maintain a 95 average, are 2 min early for classes, fail a minimum of one test, and think they are better then everyone else never doing any favors for anyone. These people are in summary full of themself.
