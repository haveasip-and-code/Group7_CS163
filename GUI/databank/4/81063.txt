Battlefield 2
The next game in the Battlefield Series. Battlefield 2 focuses on modern warfare with the United States against the Middle-East Coalition and China. It has a totally new engine (so they say) and has many new capabilities than the previous Battlefield games. One of the main features in Battlefield 2 is the commander/squad features. This will hopefully promote teamwork. In previous Battlefield games, everyone did their own thing except clans. ; It is being made by DiCE Sweden; the makers of Battlefield 1942 so hopefully it will not be a fuck up like Battlefield Vietnam. Like the previous Battlefield games, BF2 will have mods which will cover pretty much everyones tastes (WW2 mods, Realism mods, futuristic mods, gang mods, fun mods)
