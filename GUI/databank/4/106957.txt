neeooobb
Neeooobb: A declaration of delight, excitement or satisfaction. ; Pronunciation Key: (Knee-ow-b) ; Emerged during the 21st century noughties in the Peoples Republic of Cork (Ireland). Predominantly, but not exclusively, Corkonian in usage as a sister phrase to 'The Job'. The intensity of emotion being articulated may be emphasised by exaggerating the 'ow' of the pronunciation key at will. ; Expressions of mild satisfaction may be conveyed using 'Neeooobbles' referring to a 'bite-size' serving of 'Neeooobb' ; Warning!!!! ; As is frequently documented in Irish folklore, Alcohol ('Murphys' for the true Corkonian) provides the foundation of many a social event. Excessive consumption of such beverages may lead to similarly excessive but incorrect usage of the neeooobb idiom. (As illustrated below)
