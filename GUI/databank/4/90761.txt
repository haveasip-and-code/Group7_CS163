Haim'd
Definition one: The particular facial expression of someone (almost always a blonde male) looking guileless and fetching in the matter of Corey Haim, a teen star of the 1980's. To have Haim'd correctly, the mouth must be slightly open with the end of the tongue exposed, and the eyebrows raised. (see the movies 'The Lost Boys' and 'Dream a Little Dream') ; Definition two: to go on a ketamine and valium bender for weeks to years at a time.
