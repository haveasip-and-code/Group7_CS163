slc punk
A movie about the punk scene in salt Lake City in the 80's. Also goes into some ideals of being an Anarchist.. A kickass movie any aspiring young punk should watch but dont base urself on this movies to be a punk. Because remember being punk is all about being urself not fuckin following some damn fashion or listening to a certain music type to be trendy and cool only posers to that fuckin posers godamn they need to die...
