Double Dutching
Double dutch also means playing jump rope with two ropes and two people jumping simultaneously; this involves four people total: two jumping and two turning the ropes. During the very early years of hip-hop culture, double-dutch was an element of the culture, and young people, usually girls, would have double-dutch competitions at block parties. After hip-hop began moving towards the mainstream in the early 1980s, double-dutch fell out of favor as an element of hip-hop, although it remains popular with schoolchildren to this day.
