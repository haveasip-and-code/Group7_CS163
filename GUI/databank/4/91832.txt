Klingon
An honorable and warlike race, the Klingons have kicked the Romulans asses from time to time and have a language full of [pwnage], otherwise known as tlhIngan Hol. The flagship of the Klingon fleet is the Negh'Var class battleship IKS QeyIIS betleH, commanded by Chancellor Martok. Get laid a LOT more than Romulans.
