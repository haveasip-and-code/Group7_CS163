Sloopy
The year is 1965 and an almost unknown rock band from Ohio called The McCoys recorded a song called 'Hang On Sloopy.' ; 'Hang On Sloopy' was inspired by a woman named Dorothy Sloop who was a native of Steubenville, Ohio. Apparently she had a career as a singer in the 1950's and used the name 'Sloopy' as a stage name. Dorothy Sloop passed away in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Her song will long live on in the hearts of people for years to come....
