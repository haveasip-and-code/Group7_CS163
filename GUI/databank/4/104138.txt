pisco
Peruvian pisco is a grape brandy, distilled from fresh grape must. Pisco is transparent or slightly yellowish, with an alcohol content of about 42%. Pisco is also a port in Peru, the very same port where the liquor was first exported from thus giving it its name. Chile which also produces a lower quality Pisco has stolen both the name and the market place for the liquor.
