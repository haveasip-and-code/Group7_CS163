Merion Mercy
An all-girls school in Merion, PA where you actually have to know stuff to get in. Was originally Mater Misricoriae. Sr. Reggie, Dano, and Shea rule the school. The sports teams dominate.. rival schools like villa maria, gwenedd and mt st joe's. NJ girls who go to merion take the PREP bus [st joe's prep]. [OLMA] is the New Jersey imitation of Merion. Mixers are awwessomee. It would help to have some $$$.
