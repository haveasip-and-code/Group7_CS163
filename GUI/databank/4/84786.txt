The Eye of Argon
A very badly written [sword and sorcery] novella. It was written in the 1970s by 16-year-old Jim Theis and features the adventures of a wandering swordsman called [Grignr]. While the story does in fact have a plot to it -- a very standard one much like the [Conan the Barbarian] stories -- it is so badly executed that it has passed into the legends of [science fiction] [fandom].
