Catharpin
A small town that is usually considered Gainesville or Haymarket because the post office only goes to like 2 streets. Mostly farms, and the developments are required to have 10 acres each. Where the only grocery store is about the size of a 7-11 and everything costs twice as much. Nobody has even heard of Catharpin, unless they live or have lived there. And when people pronounce it like, 'Ca-tharp-in' it really makes them mad.
