Jocking
1. To jock someone. ; 2. Mocking. A way of irritating someone around you by repeating what they say, only replacing the first letter or few letters with different ones to make it rhyme in nonsense. Letters are most often replaced with 'J' and 'Qu'. On occasion the new letter can be added to the front of the word, without replacing a letter. Invented by Dustin Puehler.
