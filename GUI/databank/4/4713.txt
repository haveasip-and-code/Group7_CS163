Dream Theater
The greatest band ever. They formed in 1985 in Long Island, New York. A lot of people have already talked about their music and influences already. Their newest album is Octavarium, which contains a song called Octavarium, which clocks in at 24 minutes long, making it their longest song. You know these guys are good.
