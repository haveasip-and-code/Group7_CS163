Ain't No Thang
A [Jive] word used to replace 'I do,' often used in court when asked if you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God. Usually followed by the speaker slapping the bBble, and then the holder of the Bible using the Bible to slap the speaker's hand. For further definition, see [thang], or the movie Airplane II.
