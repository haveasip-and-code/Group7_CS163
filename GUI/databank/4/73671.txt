rage against the machine
A Karl Marx-inspired band formed in the early 90's, broke apart sometime in the year 2000. One of the most succesful political modern rock bands, and progenitors of the 'rap-rock' movement. Some of their music videos were directed by controversial filmmaker Michael Moore. Credibility is sometimes challenged, however. Tom Morello, guitarist of the band, claims to be a Marxist advocate but owns a number of expensive Cadillac automobiles at his LA home.
