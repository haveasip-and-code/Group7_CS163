Green day
Green day are a punk rock band, originated in California, being going 1988 to present. Billie Joe, Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool are the members. Their roles are front man on guitar and vocals, bass player and back up vocals and drummer respectively.Their name used to be sweet children but they changed it.Albums include Nimrod, Dookie, Kerplunk, American idiot, international super 1039/smoothed out slappy hours.Many people believe that Green day became sell-outs after releasing American idiot. That is not true. Those people are the 'old green day' fans, say that its now not cool to like them because lots of people in high school do, but that's just sad and ignorant because some fans, like me, couldn't even walk when Dookie(1994) was released.The 1st song I heard was American idiot, I am ashamed to say that was on MTV, but it wasn't my TV thank god.I thought wow this is a great song, so I downloaded the album and did a bit of research on the band. I downloaded their old stuff to, and its all equally awesome. I am unable to find a reason why that makes me a poser, but all you lot that do, please keep your ignorant comments to yourselves. Also, many people only like them because they see Billie Joe as 'sooo hot init', which is wrong, but I'm not denying that he's very sexy, but he's married with two kids! I listen for them for the music, but its totally ok to think Billie is hot. The lyrics are really meaningful, for example, in basket case.. do you have the time, to listen to me whine, about nothing and everything all at once. This is a phase many go through, feeling depressed but wondering what about and whether its everything or nothing, and this songs shows it in a kick ass way. ; Green day rock\m/
