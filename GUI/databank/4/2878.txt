Celes Chere
One of the hottest female video game characters on earth. From the game Final Fantasy VI, Celes is a soldier born with magic powers. She was with the empire until she discovered their evil plans. The emperor jailed her and she was taken prisoner and tortured. Eventually, a young thief named Locke Cole rescues her and she joins him in the fight against the Empire and Kefka. These 2 share a love story that is done much better than a certain other love story in the series (it's in the 8th game). ; Celes normally can be seen wearing a green suit, but the original amanro art shows her wearing yellow pants instead.
