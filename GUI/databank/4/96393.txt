Peanut
A member of the Modern Toss pantheon of comics and comic characters, chronicalling the power struggle that rages within the world-famous Mod supergroup Peanut. The comic features the characters Dave (bass player), Paul(drummer), Gary (lead singer), Rodriguez (Gary's PA) and Spodsie (Manager). ; It needs to be pointed out that the band members are more noted for their violent methods than their music. The comic largely follows the exploits of Dave and Paul, as they attempt to discover why they have been dropped from the band. ; In short, the funniest comic strip ever!
