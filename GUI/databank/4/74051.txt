White Hole
The direct opposite of a black hole. Whereas a black hole always sucks up matter, white holes always spew out matter. Just like wormholes, they're mathematically possible, but they don't exist in the real universe. At least, not in the dimensions we can perceive... Bwuhahahaha! *Twilight Zone music kicks in*
