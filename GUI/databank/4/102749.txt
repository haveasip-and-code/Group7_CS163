79
The sex position of choice is the during the seventies. It is like the popular '69,' but a decade later in the disco inferno we call the seventies. Like the sixty-nine, the woman lays on top of the man head-to- toe where both partners can execute oral sex to the others genitals. Make sure the woman is on top so she can use a full head and neck motion to perform her fellatio. The main difference is that the woman, while performing oral sex, sticks her finger up the guy's ass. This is due to the fact that several years after its heyday, disco and all its leisure suit glory is seen as 'kinda gay.' If enacted correctly, both partners will soon be climaxing with full orgasms that coincide to the beat of 'That's the way (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it (uh-huh, uh-huh.)'
