Humperdink
An old, fat woman who's notorious for speaking her mind and giving people advice when it's least solicited; the kind who's usually president of the community association, makes a lot of public complaints, and starts a lot of awareness and protest movements, because she has nothing better to do, often because she doesn't have a job and is nothing but a housewife with no post-secondary education or ambitions. Think about your neighbourhood busy-body; chances are that she's all but 1 or 2 of these things. (see: [Kyle's mom]) ; A lot of times, she can also be a janitor at a school or department store.
