Colorguard
in high school- a group of fat ugly cows that was rejected from any sort of cheerleading, dance team, or theatre, and wish to be accepted to some sort of group, so they hang out with all the other hideous rejects by getting together and parading around a football field twirling flags and annoying the drumline and usually taking points away from a superior band because they're so uncoordinated that can't move their hands and walk at the same time. every now and then, there is a pretty and skinny girl who does colorguard because her instrument isn't in a marching band; ie oboe, bassoon, etc. ; college level and above- a group of highly skilled and extremely attractive girls and maybe a gay guy who leave audiences in awe with the art of flag twirling.
