four letter word
Phrase that refers to any number of 'bad' words, often seen in forum posts. Can mean shit, fuck, damn, and even other non-four-lettered-words such as ass and bitch. Can also refer to the basic four letter words with suffixes (ie 'ed' 'ing'). Usually said by some religious freak or ten year old that will get in trouble if their parents see it.
