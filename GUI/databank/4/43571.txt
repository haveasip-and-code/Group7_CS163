dignitude
noun: the quality that appears the possessor as dignity but appears to others as foolishness. Originated in a 2000 Saturday Night Live skit in which Al Gore and George W. Bush are playing Scrabble, and Bush attempts to add the word 'dignitude.' Gore challenges him to use it in a sentence, and Bush replies, 'As President, George W. Bush carried himself with great dignitude' ; (Edited from atemperman's original post)
