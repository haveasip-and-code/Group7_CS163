Paranoid Social Club
An excellent band containing former members of the Rustic Overtones, heard mainly in the New England area on good radio stations. The vocals are similar to the Rustic Overtones, though the style has changed a bit and the lyrics are suited to a faster pace. ; Singles include 'Wasted,' 'She Gets Me High,' and 'Two Girls.'
