rip cord
a form of [chug]ging beer. To execute you use a old fashioned can/ bottle opener to poke a triangular shaped hole on the side of a beer can near the bottom. Hold the hole to your mouth and then pop open the top of the can. Gravity will take care of the rest. Causes one 12 ounce can of beer to be consumed in about 3-5 seconds. The ring shaped 'pop top' of the can is likend to the ring of parachutes rip cord. Popular at American Colleges in the late 80's early 90's. Sometimes but less often known as a 'pop top' or a 'shotgun'.
