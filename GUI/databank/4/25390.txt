Cof$
A vulgar term for the Church of Scientology. The term comes from the fact that Scientology churches must pay their bills by requesting fixed-amount donations for their courses or their counselling. While few other religions do that, this relatively new idea allows the Scientology religion to grow at a pace commensurate with how valuable people think it is. It has continued to grow.
