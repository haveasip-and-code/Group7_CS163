Aerosmith
The greatest rock band America ever produced, Aerosmith are still out there, rockin' hard and keeping the rock music scene alive. Not heavy like Ozzy or Metallica, Aerosmith is a true blues-rock band, and were the inspiration for Slash to start playing guitar the way he does. ; Steven Tyler ; Joe Perry ; Tom Hamilton ; Brad Whitford ; Joey Kramer ; Some of their most famous songs include Walk This Way, Dream On, Dude (Looks Like A Lady), Janie's Got A Gun, Sweet Emotion, Last Child and I Don't Want To Miss A Thing. My favourite band of all time. Check them out.
