summit high school
The greatest school there is. Unlike many other schools we have grown the tolerance to be able to have fun on the weekends and yet be able to achieve more than most schools. We get into good colleges and the majority of kids live wealthy successful lives. Nearyby schools are often jealous and it is not their fault. It is hard not to hate the town that has the best parties, education, and sports. So for those of you who do not like Summit High School, it is not our faults you suck at life
