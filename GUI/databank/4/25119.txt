Sticky-tape-bogin
While travel the electronic fairway of our great world, I was speaking with an Aussie and correcting a problem (to damn many aussies). The aussie not liking my answer (nuclear weapons) told me that it was a stick-tape-bogin. ; I told him to stick it up him criminally fried ass and smoke it!
