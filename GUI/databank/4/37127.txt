azn .. let me think. the whole 'AzN prYdE' thing, I think 99% of asians actaully go through the whole 'wE aRreE shOo coOl coZzZ wE aRre aZzzN'. ; yes i am shamed to say I went through it. but it's a fact people get over it, like I have. people in australia, are going through and over the aZn pRyDe phrase yonger in their lives. ; and btw I play DDR and sometimes use up all my money but it doesn't mean i'm an 'AzN prYdE wh0R3' or anything, it' a good game. ; AND ONE MORE THING .. it ISNT cool to 'tYpE lYkE dHIisSs' its so old. so if you want to be 'cool' and act LIKE A FRICKEN asian, stop acting like a friggin 3 yr old kid. and plus .. typing the sticky caps wastes time .. time = money.
