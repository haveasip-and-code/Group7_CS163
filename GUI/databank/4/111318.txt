My humps
A song by the Black Eyed Peas, in which mainly Fergie does the vocals. (no surprise there!) ; The song was written by Fergie after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Hence the reference to 'lumps' as in, get a mamogram every month to check for lumps. ; All proceeds will be sent to the Cancer fund. ; Please pray for Fergie, bless her soul and her humps.
