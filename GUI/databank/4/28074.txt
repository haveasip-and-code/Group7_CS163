Smells Like Teen Spirit
Smells Like Teen Spirit was written by Kurt Cobain for his band, Nirvana and is found on the album Nevermind. Kurt got the name when Kathleen Hanna (Bikini Kill, Le Tigre) spray painted 'Kurt smells like teen spirit' on the walls of his apartment. She spray painted this because, at the time, Kurt was dating Tobi Vail (Bikini Kill, riot grrrl) and she wore Teen Spirit deoderant, so Hanna said Kurt smelt like her. A parody of the song was later made by Weird Al Yankovic called 'Smells Like Nirvana'.
