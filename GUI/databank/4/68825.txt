People from Oundle School. To be honest guys, does it really matter which school you go to, I myself used to be gay like this. But next year when we aren't at school any more what are you going to do? Claim that your better than someone because of the place you were educated?! I've been to Oundle and Oakham as a pupil, they are both different, but I had just as much fun at both. Now fill in the Chips on your shoulders and get over yourselves. Have a nice day, and good luck in the A-levels! Love Audley x x x
