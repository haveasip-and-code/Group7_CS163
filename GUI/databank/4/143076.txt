Up Your Nose!
The ultimate, most beastly comeback that works very similarly to [your mom] and [your face]. Insert 'UP YOUR NOSE' whenever you: ; a. don't want to answer a question ; b. someones says something stupid ; c. are in a particularly silly mood. ; Relates to the great Potato Famine, because all he potatoes are up Quinn's nose.
