African King
the guy who sold his own people to slave traders for alcohol; someone who forsakes his own kind; also, the guy responsible for thwarting every effort by the world to help his people by intercepting and hording all humanitarian aid- that's why the argument that we spend billions to go to space when we should be using it to feed kids is illogical; we have more than enough money and resources to go to space and feed the entire world, but 'African Kings' get in the way
