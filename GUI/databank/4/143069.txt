Thad
A militant geek who was maliciously and relentlessly teased in high school who later goes on to discover the internet, and takes out his self esteem issues on random unsuspecting online community members. He often tries to mask his many shortcomings by masquerading as someone of superior intellect. He is seen as unattractive and sub-par by females, which almost guarantees he will be the first to invent a sexually fuctional computerized mate.
