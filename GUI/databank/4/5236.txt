Richard Simmons
A guy who likes to wear sequinced tops and spandex shorts - a lot. Often known for his work-out videos, such as 'Sweating to the Oldies', where he will be joined on stage with various fatties in the background. According to an A&E biography on him, he used to be an actor and referred to as 'Dickie'. He was also apparently always yearning for his father's attention (could explain some things). Has never actually gone out and said he was homosexual, but all signs seem to point to YES GAWD YES!
