jigglypuff
The balloon pokemon. In the nintendo 64 game Super Smash Brothers, Jigglypuff is both the most underrated and the most powerful. Jigglypuff has the greatest PWNage quotient out of all SuperSmashBrothers characters. Simply amazing ; Jigglypuff, the reaver of souls. Sits on the Throne of the Lord. Very pretty.
