shonen-ai
Shonen-ai is a Japanese terminology literally translated into 'shonen' = boy and 'ai' which means love. It denotes male [homosexuality], and, unlike its correspondent [yaoi], shonen-ai is used in regards to depictions of the romantic side of a relationship between two males. 'Shonen-ai,' the term, is used in [fanfiction] to warn of male [homosexuality]. ; Often, shonen-ai is associated with fluffy, cute, and cuddly relationships - but the term is not completely restricted to such descriptions. Occasionally, an author will turn out a darker portrayal of a relationship between two guys and use the term 'shonen-ai' as a forewarning that romantic relations between the two should be expected, but there will be very little (if at all) explicit sexual interactions. Unless specifically stated otherwise. ; Shonen-ai also corresponds with the term '[slash]' which has less of an emphasis on whether or not the relationship between the characters involved is romantic or entirely sexual. Shonen-ai's counterpart is [shoujo-ai] - 'girl'+'love'. And the corresponding term for [shoujo-ai] that's used in regards to explicit sexual interactions between two females is [yuri]. Shoujo-ai and [yuri] can also be called [femmeslash] - or, sometimes, just [slash].
