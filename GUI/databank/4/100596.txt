trendwhore
One who does not set trends, however follows a trend until they have strangeled every last drop of originality out of it. This is especially true in the current graphics design scene. A trendwhore can be characterized as anybody that wears the livestrong bracelets, or is friends with anybody that wears the livestrong bracelets. Usually they lack the mental capacity of knowing they are a trendwhore, therefore are hopeless and inevitably doomed.
