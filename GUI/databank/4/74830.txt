Barbara Boxer
A radical extremist hardcore 'falling of the left side of the Earth' liberal senator from California. Defends the rights of mass murderers to live while campaigning for legalized baby-killing. Is rude and antagonistic to appointees (like Condoleeza Rice). Has no knowledge of the Constitution (thinks abortion is a right specifically protected when it's not, and the right to bear arms isn't listed- when it is!). She has been openly hostile to religion multiple times.
