TRL
An abbrevation for Total Request Live ; A one hour long commercial disguised as a show. Has nothing to do with music, celebrities, or requests. An easy way for Viacom executives to manipulate the minds of the 10-18 yr old masses in order to mold them all into sheep. Viacom is friends with the recording industry, so the 20 seconds of each video on the Top 10 Countdown you see is intended to sell music quickly, hot off the press. This keeps the media companies from losing profits while the economy is bad.
