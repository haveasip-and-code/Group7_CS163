rowboating
Code name for Smoking weeeeeeed. ; Started by a student at st. louis university high school (ok me) after he coined the word when high and driving. ; While moving his arms in a rowboating fashion *while still driving* he spoke these words: ; 'Dude.... If we were in a rowboat right now.. we'd be going SOOOO fast' ; It has been codename for smoking pot ever since.
