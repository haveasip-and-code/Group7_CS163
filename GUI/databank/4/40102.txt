Safari Jacket
Often refered to as the rich man's track jacket, it is not to be mistaken as EMO but rather MBC, 'Modern British Colonial.' Popular with African big game hunters as well as those who enjoy playing safari and British conquest of South Africa, circa 1870, in school. Most times found in beige, with an unecessary amount of pockets on it along with epaulettes on the shoulders just to make look even more impressive than it already looks. Often worn on Thursdays and even the occasional Friday, although never worn without (I have no idea where I'm going with this.)
