hear hear
[From www.straightdope.com] The correct term is, 'hear, hear!' It is an abbreviation for 'hear, all ye good people, hear what this brilliant and eloquent speaker has to say!' ; Of course, if the speaker is actually asking a question. 'and just where do you think we should open the new strip club?' it's not hard to imagine that at least one yahoo in attendance might yell, 'here, here!' But this would be the exception that proves the rule.
