acton
a smallish town in Eastern Mass that shares a school with another small town called boxborough, which is even smaller. adjacent to acton is the town of [concord]. these towns have much in common. both share a school with a much smaller town (carlisle, boxborough). All four towns are quite wealthy on average. In acton, they like to make rude comments about how bad [concord/carlisle] high school is, in terms of spoiledness and sketchyness. What they don't realize is that they are pointing out faults that exist in their own school as well. They also like to shove their sports teams in our face. However, the only team they have that beats C-C regularly is their football team, and they are regularly embarrassed in a number of other sports.
