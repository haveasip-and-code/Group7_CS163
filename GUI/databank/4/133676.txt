IpI
An acronym for 'I'm Pubbin' it.' A CS 1.6 clan that is about Cal-O level, except most of our players are declining in their skill... stupid mmorpgs. ; Omnislasher is pretty much the best, Krypticskillz comes second and could be up to Omni's skill. ; Genesis shouldn't be noob.... stop being so school devoted. ; Noskillz is the noob.
