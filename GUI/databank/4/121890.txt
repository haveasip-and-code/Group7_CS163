DJ
Upon entering high school, the definition of a DJ changes and becomes something entirely different. Before, a DJ was the man who played songs at school discos, but now, a DJ is any chav who talks fast and thinks they can 'mc'. DJ's often give themselves names, such as: DJ Frizzle, DJ Bling or Bad Boy DJ Raz.
