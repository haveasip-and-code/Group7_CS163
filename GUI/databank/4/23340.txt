ramble
To lead a semi-nomadic existence, traveling from town to town, making a living from odd jobs. To be rootless and transient, calling no one place home. ; Sung about often in old folk music, which was written from the perspective of humble, working people, many of whom traveled from town to town in search of work during the Gread Depression. Often used, particularly in the work of Woody Gutherie, as a metaphor for life's journey.
