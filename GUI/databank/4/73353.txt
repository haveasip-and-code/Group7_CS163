Bobby Fischer
Everyone's favorite [anti-semite]child prodigy. Even with his incredible intelligence and chess playing skills he's just as vulnerable to dementia and trauma which has become evident in the past few years.(Early childhood and chess playing losses explain his hatred of jews, and the the all the anti Americaness) He is a great example that all the mental prowess and glory goes to pot when you let yourself be corrupted by the sins of greed and envy.
