bridgewater primary
the shittiest school in the southern hemisphere, I was learnig shit there (keyword, shit) that I learnt in year 2 at my previous school. [marbury] and the principal and the rest of the teachers there (except Jodi and Sue, they were good teachers, I actually learnt stuff thru them) and have a pike shoved up their arses and drowned, then revived, then have the same thing happen to them all over again
