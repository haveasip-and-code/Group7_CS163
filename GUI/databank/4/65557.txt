Legends of the Hidden Temple
An underrated Nickelodeon game show, which ran from 1993-1996. Players must complete challenges, based on the historical legend of the day. ; Starting off, we have the following teams: ; Red Jaguars ; Purple Parrots ; Blue Barracudas ; Green Monkeys ; Orange Iguanas ; and Silver Snakes. ; First, the teams must try to cross a moat. Only four of the six teams will make it to... ; the Steps of Knowledge. Teams must correctly answer questions about the legend, and make it down to the bottom step. Two teams will advance to... ; the Temple Games. The teams must complete 3 physical challenges, loosely based on the legend of the day, and they earn Pendants of Life for winning. The team with the most pendants, or the winner of the tiebreaker, will go to the bonus round... ; Olmec's Temple. Here, the remaining team must negotiate the temple, get the legendary artifact, and get out, within 3 minutes. If they run out of time, or if the second player gets caught by aq temple guard with no pendant, GAME OVER. ; If the team succeeds in getting out of the temple, with the artifact, before time is up, they will win a vacation. ; All in all, this was a pretty good show, which died long before its time. Nickelodeon could have supported a show like this nowadays, but no.... they just HAVE to be the next Cartoon Network.
