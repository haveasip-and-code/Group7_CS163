tupac shakur
Rapper Tupac Amaru Shakur. The son of a Black Panther, Tupac has gone down in history for his role in shaping hip-hop. A true noble poet, Tupac will be remembered for ever. Often hated in life he payed the price in September 96. Whoever did it; police, bloods, crips or Orlando Anderson, they will live to regret what they did. ; RIP Tupac Shakur, a true influence,
