skip
A term of derision by non-Anglo-Celtic Australians to describe Anglo-Celtic Australians. Especially used in inner-urban, working class areas of Melbourne frequented by children of Greek, Italian or Vietnamese migrants ('wogs') to describe (especially blue eyed, blond) Anglo-Celtic Australians. Only considered very mildly offensive. Started in the mid nineteen-seventies and still occasionally used in the early twenty-first century, as there is no similar word available for this purpose. ; Derived from 'Skippy', a very popular Australian TV program from the 1960's about a (very clever) kangaroo and his human (Anglo-Celtic Australian) guardians.
