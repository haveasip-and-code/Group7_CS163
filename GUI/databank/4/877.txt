action 52
An unlicensed game with 52 games in one cart, created by Active Enterprises at the price of $200 (a 'bargain' at less than $4 a game, they boasted) for the NES and later, the Sega Genesis. ; Action 52 is the worst game ever made. Poorly programmed, all 52 games are loaded with bugs and glitches, and as a result, are impossible to beat. The graphics, sound effects and music are very poor. The game was met with heavy criticism and the company folded, but not before releasing [Cheetahmen 2], which was a sequel to the 52nd game on the cart. This game is now coveted by collectors of NES games.
