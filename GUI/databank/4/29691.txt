Marshall Stack
A guitar amplifier stack that has been used quite extensively in rock music for a span of over 40 years. Although marshall stacks have been recently replaced by Mesa Boogie dual and triple rectifier stacks, Marshall stacks are still seen quite frequently in the rock scene and have definitely held up through the test of time.
