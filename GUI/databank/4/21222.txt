X-Box
A decent gaming system that has its ups and downs. ; The X-Box is large, bulky, and has a huge controller, but that's beside the point. There are a few good games on it, such as Halo or Counter-strike. These games are out for the PC but need a $2000 machine to run, the X-Box costs only $100-300. ; The reason most people hate it is because ; A. it's made by Microsoft ; B. it's huge ; C. the games they played must have sucked ; Just because its made by Microsoft doesn't automatically mean it sucks. Halo was made by Microsoft, and look how it's doing, hmm? ; The controller is an exact duplicate of the PS2 controller, just substitute the Black and White buttons for L2 and R2. Hell you could probably play the X-Box with a PS2 controller if it had the right plug. ; So, in closing, I think that the X-Box is probably the only good thing made by Microsoft.
