CAW
A internet fad. People use wreslting games such as: WWE Day of Reckoning, Smackdown VS Raw, or Wrestle Mania 21 to put on a fantasy wrestling show. These shows usually use CAW (created a wrestler) rather than the superstars in the game. The most well known CAW show was NODQ CAW, and Slam N' Jam.
