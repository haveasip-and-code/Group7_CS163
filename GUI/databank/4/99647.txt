netraloip
An incredibly boring person, so boring in fact, that they could become the physical incarnation of boredom, or even the god of boringness. They often have voices so dull that they create some kind of timewarp where the seconds drag on as they speak. Often have nerdy interests such as classics or anime, but this is not always the case. They are also ugly, without exception.
