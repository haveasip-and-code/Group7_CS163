ward
sections of a citiy usually divided up for municipal or district purposes. Wards are typically similar in size but not always in numerical order;for example in new orleans the 15th and 16th wards are not close to each other at all.streets have nothing to do with the names of wards however certain streets do mark the border of a ward.
