Programming / Networking Instructor
A very evil person. This person loves to whip her students with Cat5 cable and make them do 87 page chapters in 5 minutes, or they fail the semester. She also has a wierd obsession with one of the head persons there, always threatening to send them out, but never does. She also blames the A.M. Class for all of the server problems, saying we are all hackers, but the P.M. Class doesn't do ANYTHING wrong. ; See [evil].
