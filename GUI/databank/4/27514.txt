patriot
A citizen of one of the united States who loves his country. ; Commonly, 'love your country' is incorrectly interpreted as 'support your country's government regardless of what it is doing'. This is also, consequently, the type of person that people mistake a patriot as. ; A true patriot loves his country to the extent that he will work to change it or point out what his country's government is doing wrong. ; Most patriots wish to change the government to run the way the constitution describes it should.
