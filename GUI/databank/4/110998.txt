Delia's
A store for girly girls, lots of fun. Sells some vintage looking clothes. Also some very unique pieces. Price ranges are usually not that bad, but will occasionally overprice jeans. Really cute skirts. Stylish, size ranges go from very small to very big. People shop there who also shop at hot topic, and people shop there who also shop at abercrombie. An overall good store. Great when on sale.
