creepy e
a creepy guy, named eric, that shamelessly hits on co-workers. often lurks near the lunchroom casually eyeballing new 'office meat.' somtimes has a really annoying laugh, and hits on girls from his 'ride' at stoplights and junior high schools. ; uses such pickup lines as 'im having a rave at my pad, wanna chill?' and 'make way for the princess!'
