guns n' roses
One of rocks greatest bands. They brought a fresh new sound and look to the 80's rock mainstream that was, at that time, dominated by hair bands and men that dressed like they were women. Guns N' Roses were known as 'one of rocks most dangerous bands' and they lived there life on the edge. They were a great band that, sadly, couldn't make it last by letting ego's and creative differences tear them apart.
