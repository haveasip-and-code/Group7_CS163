ronker
Noun. A member of the travelling community that wakes you up by knocking on your door and trying to sell you something useless. It is usually an old lady who will be flanked by angry looking young men, she will be carrying some pegs and heather, perhaps some gravel freshly picked up from the street, all of which will be described as 'lucky'. Refusal of purchase will result in a curse being issued and your windows put through later in the day.
