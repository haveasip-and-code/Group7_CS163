818
The area code of The San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. The vslley is huge, consisting tons of L.A. suburbs. '818' is the gangsta way to call it, as there are lots of gangstas down in L.A., so yeah. The people that reside in the valley (particularly the Persians), always say things like : '2Live 'n' die in tha 818 area.' Even through in contains only suburbs of Los Angeles, gangstas still live in there. It's still the 'safe', 'unhard' valley, but there are 'hood' cities in there (i.e. Reseda, Sherman Oaks, Woodland Hills, and especially Pacoima!) If a person resides in the valley, it is 'cool'. Also the 818 is the birthplace of the phrase [Persian Pride]. Probably down in Reseda. A shit load of Iranian-Americans reside there. ; And by the way, I reside in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, and the are fucking dangerous places to be at night.
