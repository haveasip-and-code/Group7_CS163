falun gong
A cult that supposedly practises spirituality but is in fact, purely anti-Communist propaganda and delusion of the mind. Anyway back to the definition, Falun Gong is a brainwashing cult that has led to numerous people setting themselves on fire. America will start banning this cult once some Americans set themselves on fire.
