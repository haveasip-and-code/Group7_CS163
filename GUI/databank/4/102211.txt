potato queen
Quite simply, potato queens are gay Asian males who tend to feel sexually attracted to White guys, but do not discriminate in friendship. Potato queens are usually more attractive, fun, outgoing and self-confident than their [sticky rice] counterparts. Often bitter, racist anti-White [sticky rice] will try to bash [potato queen] Asian males because the potato queens have no romantic interest in dating the generally less attractive, ethnocentric [sticky rice]. One needs only to look at some of these other definitions from English grammar-challenged Asian stickies to see this. Sadly for [sticky rice], White guys usually are not into them anyway and generally prefer potato queens, so [sticky rice] animosity becomes a moot point.
