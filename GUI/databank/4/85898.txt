NES
A system released by nintendo, nintendo: japanese for in the hands of heaven. The nintendo was released in the united states in 1986 shortly after the 'great video game crash' in 1984. Nintendo, knowing the stigma of videogame systems in america after the crash.

After the NES was relaeased nintendo had a stranglehold on the video game market. With some good in house devleopers, and creating contract restraints with 3rd party developers. Which meant that if you developed games for the 'big N' you couldnt develop for anyone else, And the 3rd party game had to earn the nintendo 'seal of approval'. this strangle hold on the market led to the failure of the NES's main competitor, the sega master system, or SMS. Which was graphically superior and had some quite good games for it, but because of a lack of third party support due to nintendo's contract restrictions, it failed. Which meant that nintendo was the leader in the video game market in the late eighties. Until that is, the [Sega Genesis] was released in 1989...
