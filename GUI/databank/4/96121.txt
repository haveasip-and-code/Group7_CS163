Highest end department store in the Kansas City Area. Has 2 locations, one on the Plaza and one in Crown Center. Is owned by Hallmark, the greeting card company. Sells designer names, pretty much the only department store in the area that does so. Favorite store of Johnson County brats spending their parents money.
