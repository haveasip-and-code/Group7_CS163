chicksan
[Dudesan] Chicksan is used as a courtesy title in Japanese-speaking areas as a suffix to the given name, surname, or title of the person being addressed, regardless of age or gender: Yamamoto san; sensei-san. You don't speak Japanese, can't pronounce the name, or you just don't know their name so you just add Chick. Or it's just one one of your pals.
