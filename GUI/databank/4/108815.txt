drop trow
A trowel is a simple hand tool used to layer or 'slot in' mortar between stones or bricks by a mason. While the spelling has changed, 'drop trow' is long forgotten slang from the masonry trade meaning to immediately 'drop the trowel', stop working, and/or walk away from the job. The term was often used in reference to unionization and labor strikes in the 1880's through the 1950's in the United States.
