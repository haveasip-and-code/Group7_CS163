cactapus
A half cactus, half octopus who lives in the snow. The reason for this being, that the first generation of Cactapi couldnt decide whether to live in desert or ocean, and due to alot of family feuds, they ended out living in snow. Pretty much any snow, anywhere. ; History: Actually a word I used as an insult one morning. I attempted to say Cactus and said Cactapus. I bet you can tell I'm not very good at mornings. ; (Dear Cactapi, I am terribly sorry for using your species as an insult.)
