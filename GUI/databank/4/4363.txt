Jehovah's Witness
A religious organization. It manifests many cult-like traits like all religions throughout history. Most hated by the common people for their tendency to spread their version of the bible to everyone, at any time. However, the JW is a rather docile and pleasant creature when their unrelenting urge to save all humanity is overlooked. They almost always travel in flocks of two or more. ; Their closest cousin in behavior is the [Mormon], although a JW is harder to get rid of and harder to catch off guard as they spend an average of three to five hours a week studying the bible and its related subjects. ; As with all religions they have their own ideals, beliefs, practices and have been persecuted throughout history by all manner of peoples including such famous oppressors as [Adolf Hitler] and the [Catholics]. ; Suggestion from an ex JW: When faced with a Jehovah's Witness pretend to be devotely [Satanic] and do not accept literature of any kind, no matter how small. Be extreme with the satanism, almost to the point of violence.
