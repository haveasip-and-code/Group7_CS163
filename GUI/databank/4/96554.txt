Yankee
1. In the southern states, the term YANKEE is used to identify someone from a northern state, especially those that happen to be from NY. Some southern [folk] dislike yankees because they assume that the northerners are rude individuals. I think its just a misunderstanding of cultures. ; 2. When a New Yorker travels to another state, they may refer to themselves as a 'yankee' to let everyone know that they are from the same place as the all time best baseball team in the world (not boston...they suck)
