downsy
A person, generally from the eastern hemisphere, who has been stricken with an extra twenty first chromesome given to them by their unloving mother. This extra inconvenience is refferred to as 'Trisomy 21,' and often forces the 'downsy' to live a life working behind the scenes of carnivals (out of the public eye) and eating everybody's cookie dough.
