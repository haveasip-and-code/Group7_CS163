Union City
Union City is a congested, gritty, industrial small city in [North Jersey]. It has a lot of New York City influence since it is just less than five minutes away from Manhattan. Union City is rather impoverished but it has always been a destination for immigrants. It is the Little Havana of New Jersey, better the Hispanic capital of the state. The Hispanic population is very diversified with Cubans on the top. It features Bergenline Avenue, the chief commercial thoroughfare and a gateway to Latin America. UC is sometimes crime ridden but other than that it's ok.
