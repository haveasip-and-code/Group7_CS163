Vas te faire foutre
'Go fuck yourself', or 'Fuck you' in French. ; Va te faire foutre is spelt INCORRECTLY. The conjugation for Aller (to go) in French for tu (which is the assumed pronoun, as the reflexive is using te [se foutre is a reflexive verb]) is Vas NOT Va which is the conjugation for il/elle/qui/on (he/she/who/one)
