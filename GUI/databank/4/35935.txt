lemon wedge
A game of quick thinking and adjective/noun pairs (or humorous inside jokes). ; Gameplay: Two or more opponents square off by listing ridiculously random things that usually follow a 2 syllable - 1 syllable pattern (e.g. lem-mon wedge) Exceptions may be made to this pattern. No pair may be used twice. If the game is played via paper, the obligatory elipsis (...) must be used. Ninja moves may be executed during physical play. ; Winning: To win, your opponent(s) must run out of ideas or repeat a pair that has already been said. To win you must say, 'Lemon wedge, I win!' Or something to that extent. (e.g. 'Lemon wedge, I pwn!' or 'Lemon wedge, you got vanquished!')
