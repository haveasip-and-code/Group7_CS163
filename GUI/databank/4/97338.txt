pompalope
1)A 'Pompalope' is a very rare type of fruit. It grows only on a very small un-named, un-charted, tropical island off the coast of Australia. the inhabitants of the island believe they posses magical healing powers. Scientist are currently studding them, some think they may be a cure for such viral infections such as the common cold and also a possible cure to AIDS/HIV. Others think they may cure cancer. A pompolope is similar to an apple in taste, but similar to a pear in shape. and are about the size of a watermelon. Ripe pompolopes are usually orange with splotches of purple. Un-ripe pompolopes are usually orange with green splotches. un-ripe pompolopes are very poisonous, causing either a hallucinogenic drug-like effect which will only last about two-three hours ,or cause an extremely high fever and possibly death. ; 2) a word I like to spontaneously shout out in public places. ; 3)another word for 'cool' ; 4)another word for 'beautiful'
