boneless
An oldschool skateboard trick with a strange name. You grab your board with your hand, step down with your front foot and jump off the ground holding your deck and with your back foot on the deck. Land on the deck and roll away. ; It also has some variations, as can be seen in various ol'skool skate videos.
