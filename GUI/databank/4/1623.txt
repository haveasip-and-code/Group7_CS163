Republicans
A political party, formed in Ripon Wisconsin in 1850s. Funny that their main platform was anti-slavery but now Democrats have the black vote. Lincoln was the first Republican, he was killed (durr). The elephant symbol was actually created in a cartoon after Democrats attempted to scare Republicans into thinking that President Grant would run for a 3rd term. The cartoon showed the Republicans as a huge elephant unscared by the rearing of the Democrat Jackass. The Republican philosophy encourages individual liberty, individual decision-making, entrepreneurship, and creativity. ; I wish they'd be against welfare, food stamps, government grants, border jumpers (wet backs), and other idiots that ruin this fair country. They should be more for weed, drinking, and free liberties. But, you can't have both, so, between Republicans and Democrats, I choose the better compromise.
