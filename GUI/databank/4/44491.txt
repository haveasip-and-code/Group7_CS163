abington
Ok, the definition above has a few things really wrong. No one calls it 'bington, unless they are cheering for high school sports (give me an A, 'A,' give me a bington, 'bington'). Not only is it one of the wealthiest, but it also one of the most economically diverse communities. We've the got po'est of the po, and richest of the rich. And most importantly, we got big doc B telling us we're first in the alphabet, first in academics, etc., etc.
