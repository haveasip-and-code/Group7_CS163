the GREATEST site around. me, aaron and my brother pat are the creators of this awesome site. we are doing our part in fighting to save music from the label's stranglehold on this true art form of expression. record labels control on music should be loosened because music is one of the greatest forms of artistic expression in the world. why must labels continue to control music so much. leave talent to the talented people (south park quote).
