Faith No More
A truly amazing band. It's one out a slight few alt bands that's actually cool. Jim Martin is a great guitar player. The only objection I have is that some people claim it's rap too. 1.) FNM is too cool to be rap ; 2.) Mike Patton's singing on 'Epic' is more punk than rap ; The other thing I don't like about them are these other shitty alt bands ripping off their style.
