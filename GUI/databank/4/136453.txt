Field Hockey Fanatic
a crazed male field hockey fan; a field hockey fantatic is a male field hockey fan who thinks field hockey is the shit of sports. He will wake up wicked early to watch field hockey tournaments, and will be noted as 'rude' by the referees. A group of fanatics are usually led by a very sexist male who is convinced that guys can beat girls in field hockey,wears field hockey jackets, shows up at field hockey team meetings, and might try out for the team. A fanatic will yell rude cheers at referees such as 'get off your knees ref, your blowin' the game', but aren't sure of any rules, too lazy to read them. A fanatic will show up at games, not knowing why, but continuing to cheer and insult the referees, always stepping it up to the next level, saying 'they haven't heard shit yet'.
