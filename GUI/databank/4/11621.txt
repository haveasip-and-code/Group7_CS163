xenosaga
A prequel to Xenogears and a breath of fresh air in a world made up of childish Grand Theft Auto and repetitive Final Fantasy games. ; As a side note, the person who claims that it is a Christian game needs to get an education in BASIC FUCKING PHILOSOPHY! The game draws from many philosophies and religion; everything from Jungian psychology to the Kabbalah. This is not a game to play passively. To all the people suffering from A.D.D. who claim the game is to slow, go back to Mortal Kombat. This is out of your league. Xenosaga is for the serious RPG gamer. ; Not the best game out there, but it kicks the shit out of Final Fantasy any day.
