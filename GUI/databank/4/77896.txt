Bogdan
A tall, peaceful mother fuka(1). Looks weak and likes panzie soccer. Likes math but keeps it real with his hoez. Afraid of snakes and playa hataz(2). Likes class in women(3). Drinking before clubs is a must for him. Doesn't underestimate the predictability of stupidity(4). He thinks Romanians are the shit but he'z wrong. They're probably not. Preposterously sociable, aiight? 1/3 of his life revolves around music and that's cool...fukin fairy. Confident but self doubtful. Respects his enemies(5). Greatest fight within himself.
