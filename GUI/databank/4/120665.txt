ORANGE RANGE
A J-Rock band hailing from Onikawa. ; It consists of five members; Yamato (mid vox), Ryo (low vox), Hiroki (high vox), Naoto (guitar), Yoh (Ryo's older brother, and bass), and Katchan (drums). ; I rather think Katchan looks like a woman, but that's beyond the point. ; ORANGE RANGE was formed in 2001, and named by Naoto's mother, or something along the lines of that. ; Their first single was 'My Paulownia Paulownia', followed by 'Shanghai Honey', with many more singles to come. ; Their first tour was sold out. ; They became known in the US by singing the third Naruto ending song, which was called 'Viva Rock'. The -not- TV version was absolutely fabulous. ; But I still don't think too many people know about them. *tear*
