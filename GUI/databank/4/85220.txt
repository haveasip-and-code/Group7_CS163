Tee hee girl
A tee hee girl, or more commonly referred to as an airhead or dumb blonde, is the bubblegum princess in the world of labels. The mini-skirt, 'baby doll' tee and stores such as Mariposa, Claires/Afterthoughts, and Abercrombie & Fitch were specifically designed for this breed of girl. They earn the name 'tee hee' for the giggle that is emitted from their gloss covered mouths. The giggle is usually emitted: when their lack of intelligence blocks a real answer to any sort of question, they are mindlessy flirting with any boy in sight, they are partaking in their favorite pasttime of gossiping on the phone with their friends, basically after any and every sentence. The hair flip, confused look, and sentence 'whatever' were perfected by the teehee girl. ; The epitome of a tee hee girl would be Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears.
