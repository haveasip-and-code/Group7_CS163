firefreek
When the length of the male genetal is greater in width than length. A real firefreek, should one be so unlucky as to see one, looks remakably similiar to a hockey puck or a miniture tractor tire. Those suffering from an inwardly collapsing scrotom, must take careful measures to keep their firefreek syndrome in balance. I recommend atleast 3 tablespoons of confectionary sugar daily, and as much crystal meth as one can get one's hands upon
