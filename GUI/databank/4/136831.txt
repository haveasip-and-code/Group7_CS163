Reporter
The 'Reporter' (n) A Gordita combo meal from Taco Bell. Just as a firecracker has a report, so too does the Taco Bell Gordita. If you have it for lunch, the report will occur around 3 o'clock. In other words, you will have to [pinch a loaf] shortly after eating it. The 'Report' time varies per person.
