pityriasis rosea
A relentless rash that envelops one's body for six to eight weeks, inducing fits of vomit upon anyone who sees it (including oneself) and taking over one's social life and sleeping patterns in the process. Fear it, embrace it, and don't piss it off. Is not contagious and usually affects young adults in order that their college experience be made as humiliating as possible.
