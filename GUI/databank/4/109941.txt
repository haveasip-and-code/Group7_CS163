hipster dancing
When people, namely hipsters, 'dance' at concerts by standing around, bopping their heads, occasionally tapping there foot and MAYBE once in a while swaying their hips. This is to make sure that they look like they are enjoying themselves but not TOO much because that wouldn't be cool.
