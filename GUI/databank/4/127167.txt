artesian well
Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled in 1126. The technique used was percussion drilling in which a rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer. ; The name is now applied to wells of reasonable depth that produce water without the need for pumping.
