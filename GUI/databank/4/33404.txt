Intercom Tag
What Managers Do In The Retail Business, When Someone Pages a Person Via The Intercom To Dial Them At a Certain Number, Then The Paged Person Pages The Pager With A Certain Number. Happens When You Can't Hear The Phone Extention to Dial, It Usually Goes on for like Five Minutes Until An Outside Party Who Actually Heard The Extention Number Tells One Of The Pagers. Pretty Annoying if You Have To Hear It 8:30 am on a Monday.
