forever 21
A very well-lit store that is found in a lot of big malls. The clothes are very pretty, and usually somewhat inexpensive. All the clothes are made for people that are (in my opinion) under a size 5, have no hips or but whatsoever, and enjoy showing their heavily busted chest. That's why I buy their skirts! ; Most of the clothes are actually shirts, most of the time over-decorated, but hey... someone's gotta give nice stuff for cheap!
