kingdom hearts
a kickass game that i got as a b-day present from my aunt. at first i thought it was gay because i had never play FF before and i thought the whole disney aspect was for toddlers but then i played it. the start of the game made me feel like i really didnt want to play but then it got better, and better, and better. it revealed an amazing and surprisingly dark storyline which i just loved. and the cameos from FF are class because you get to see classic charachters redone with amazing graphics (Examples:Cloud, Squall, Yuffie and my personal favourite cameo,Sephiroth) ; In short KH blew my brains out the back of my head with amazing force and beauty! ; P.S: I think Ansem should go down in video game history for being one of the coolest villains ever!
