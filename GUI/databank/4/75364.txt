Baller
A baller was originally used to describe a Pro Basketball Player but how it refers to this context is what those playes do with thier money. They come back to thier old neighborhoods and spend thier money where they feel the most comfortable which is excess compared to the people who still live in the community. $10,000 bar bills in a local club, $5,000 shoes for a community dance $200,000 car in a neighborhood where the average value of a car is about $7,500 and the aveage age is 6-7 years old. There are men were formally poor but who have found ways to make large amounts of money $75,000yr or more but prefer to spend it among partying with the poor where they shine because of thier new found wealth than with the rich where they are shunned because of thier pedigree or color. A baller most accurately describes a man with money who likes to spend it. One who has accumulated wealth in a Roth IRA and shops at Wal-Mart for everything and is cheap when he goes out to party is not a baller. He may be wealthy but he is not a baller. A baller only applies to someone with a net income of $75,000yr or more and signs of his wealth are visible. Aston Martin Vanguish, brand new 7 series BMW, house worth more that $350,000 and he flaunts it (tastefully) among people who are not as fortunate and becomes a celebrity of sorts.
