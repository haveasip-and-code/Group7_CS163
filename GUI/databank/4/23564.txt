UfT
The incorrect acronym of the University of Toronto. It's either UT or UofT. What is UFT? Are you illiterate? No one actually attending UofT actually says I go to UFT. ; If you say this, you probably go to another University or College with no idea about the CORRECT word to describe a university that's better than yours. ; (except Western's Ivey, York's Schulich, and Waterloo's Engineering)
