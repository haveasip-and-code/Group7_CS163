Cuban cigar
1. the finest of cigars produced in the land of Fidel Castro. ; 2. the sexually perverse act of placing plastic wrap over a person's open mouth and proceeding to defecate into the plastic wrap. The poop slides into the person's mouth with the aid of the plastic and provides a satisfying cigar like treat at 98.6 degrees.
