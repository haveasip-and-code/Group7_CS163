Tvangeste
A pagan almost-melodic black metal band from Prussia. This band deals mainly with the issues of the old pagan countries that fell to Christianity (last of which was Latvia, I'm not sure exactly when, I would say roughly 1200) and the issue of Christianity destroying the pagan traditions. The lyrics are sweet, thought-provoking and very moving and the instrumentality is brilliant. ; I would recomend their two albums- Damnation of Regiomontum and FireStorm to anyone interested in melodic death & black or pagan music.
