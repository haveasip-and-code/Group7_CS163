america's next top model
A good show, that it's very repetitive. A lot of hoochie-mamas trying to be models when they can't even do their little turn on the cat walk, yeah on the cat walk they can't even do their little turns on the cat walk. They think their too sexy for their cats, too sexy for their cats, so sexy it hurts. ooh yeah, good show by the way, I watch it, you got a problem? I like how Tyra Banks tried to be all Oprahish when she yelled at that crack-head, ghetto hoochie of Tiffany, like she cares, ha! ; same thing over and over:'Congratulations, you are now one step closer towards becoming America's next top model.' what will you do, coke or pepsi?
