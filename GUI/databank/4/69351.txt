these ones
A hand gesture that requires the arm to be raised to approximately head height, the three middle fingers pointing inward and the pinky finger and thumb outstreched. The hand is then quickly and repeatedly twisted from side to side. Usually seen being used on pathetic Vietnamese dancefloors by overly enthusiastic red headed losers who think the DJ's lame techno re-mix of volare, followed by 'let's get loud' by J-Lo (for the 3rd time in an hour) actually warrants the aforementioned dancefloor being labelled the 'best dancefloor ever!!' The act of giving 'these ones' will be frowned upon by all except stocky quiff haired wank-a-holics who are too intoxicated to realise that the dancefloor in question would actually be less lame if the DJ spun a Nicki Webster mega-mix.
