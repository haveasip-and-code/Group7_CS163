Good Day Sir
One day, two marijuana enthusiasts smoked some rather potent weed. This weed did things to them like nothing they had ever smoked before. At the end of the night one of the stoners dropped off the second stoner, but before driving away he shouted 'Good Day Sir' and drove off without saying another word. Ever since that day stoners occasionally use this expression in place of saying 'goodbye'
