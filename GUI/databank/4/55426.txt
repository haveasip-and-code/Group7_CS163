South St.
A very small, yet active and important street in Brighton, MA. An essential part of the Boston College Community, many South St. residents are Boston College Juniors who love the fact that there are no RAs and Kegs are cheap. Usually active until deep into the night on weekends, the student-residents of South St. uphold a rich tradition of unruly tennants and way too much drinking.
