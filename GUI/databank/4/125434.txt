Houston Galleria
Opened in 1970, Houston's Galleria is the original, in the sense that it was the first mall in the U.S. to fuse a mall with hotels and office towers, not to mention an ice skating rink bigger than Rockefeller Center. The mixed-use concept has been used in other malls since then, but this was the first, and therefore important in the evolution of malls. Modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan, Italy. Currently about 375 stores and 50 restaurants.
