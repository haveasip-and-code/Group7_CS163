bakkerism
Bakkerism is a philosophy and/or religion based on the collective thought of the Dutch philosopher Nicolaas Bakker, who traveled between foriegn lands and culture for much of his life, learing the traditions and rituals of many different peoples. Finally originating while Bakker was traveling in the small Asian country of Palau, Bakkerism has begun to spread throughout South America and some Southern South African countries (most notably of which would be the North Eastern parst of the former Dutch colony of South Africa). ; The goal of Bakkerism is much like the aim to Buddhism, to become free of suffering. Bakkerism also advocates the principles of free thought and reaching one's own true potential. ; Bakkerism is sometimes seen as a very irregular religion, due to the fact that morals are not always placed at highest priority. Many traditional Western moral ideas are also left out and often seen by many Bakkerist as somewhat primative or unrealistic. Self discipline is taught in Bakkerism through mental training and general wisdom. ; Bakkerism tends not to focus on supernatural existence, as it neither denies or approves the possibilities of their existence. For this reason, many Bakkerist often partake in other religious or tribalist ideas while still labeling themselves Bakkerist.
