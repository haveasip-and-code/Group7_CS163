The Doctor selling left over bonbons downs the halls ways from me. He can often be seen dancing his way into the He Ho C to ask 'Michael' for frivilous little tasks while 'Michael' is on the phone with Ted Turner, or Colin Powell. Soffwood's assists stance is Jorre Jorre Jorre de Jorre Jorre Jorre Jorre Jorre.
