nozzle
v.t. 'nozzle' is a verb which means, 'to rouse another individual by inserting an object in his or her nose.' Usually, this is a tactic used for waking up someone who is sleeping or who has passed out due to intoxication. Although many objects may be used to nozzle someone, the instrument of choice is a twizzler because it has maximum rigidity without the drawback of causing actual damage to the recipient's nasal cavity.
