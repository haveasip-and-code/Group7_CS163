RC Empire
A horribly shitty webpage started by a few sad individuals from Lincoln County High School in Fayetteville, Tennessee. Dubbing themselves the 'Random Crap Crew,' the members of RC Empire engage in and film hilariously unoriginal activities such as jousting on escalators, smashing used automobiles, and circle-jerking. Has sparked several 'online wars' with other shitty webpages such as Ignus Software (owned by [Vasco Ignus]), Ragtime, and W00tco.
