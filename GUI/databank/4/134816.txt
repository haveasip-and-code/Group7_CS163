Give Me a Dollar
Yes it sounds like it means but then was turned into a funny joke in NY and NJ. Started around the summer of 2002 by a kid in south NJ. Saying it is most of the time meaningless and is meant to be oddly funny. The phrase 'give me a dollar' is funny because hardly no one ever says that or ever will to be serious. ; You now hear 'Give me a dollar.' in middle schools and spoken by bored teenagers throughout the northeast of the USA. Another use by saying it is to shut people up.
