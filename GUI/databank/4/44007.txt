8-Bit Theater
One of the best Web Comics around, comprised of the follwing characters, the rouge elven Theif. Who conned everyone into him becoming Team Leader. The stab happy Black MAge, who wants to kill the team and possibly get it on with White Mage. The idiotic Sword loving dolt Fighter, who stupidly enough, is the reason this comic exsists. The Dice User (See: [D&D Reject] ) Red Mage, who tries to do everything in Dungeons and Dragons terms. The fighting Black Belt, who is most easily the character who stands out the most. because he came he from another time, (See:[Time Travel]) and the snae White Mage, who's Hammer and Healing spells are half the reason the bumbling idiots haven't DIED yet.
