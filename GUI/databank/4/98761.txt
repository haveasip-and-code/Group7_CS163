eye worms
Those kind of brownish transparent things floating on your eye balls. If you focus on them they keep moving and you can never make one stay still. Its like they are floating all around your eye for no reason but when you look in the mirror you cant see them. When you try to turn your head to follow them people think you are crazy and throw rocks at you.
