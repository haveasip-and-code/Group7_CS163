Alternachick
Any girl who dresses everyday like she is going to some concert doens't matter what kind of music it is (rock, techno, whatever) as long as fits into some stereotype. Although heterosexual, these girls don't like dating guys. Thay are tomboys but they are not butch. Unlike [metro sexual]s they are not high maintenance. (Thats where there is role reversal: [Metro sexual]s are high maintenance as you would expect a girl to be. Alternachicks are not they are more like guys.) I don't know if they can be labeled as a whore because you can't say they go sleeping around with everyone but it seems that they prefer flings over dating. It seems that both [metro sexual]s and alternachicks seem to lead the lifestle of the opposite sex, only without being masculine or butch.
