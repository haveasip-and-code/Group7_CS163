Bohemian
This term is incorrectly said to refer to a person who leads their life without regard to conventional standards of behaviour because that is how Gypsies lived and it was believed that Gypsies originally hailed from Bohemia, part of what is modern-day Czech Republic. Gypsies actually emigrated from northern Indian so it should also be noted that the term 'Gypsy' which is derived from 'Egyptian' is also incorrect although it is more widely accepted. The most etymologically correct term would be 'Romani' or 'Romany' which is the Gypsies original word for themselves.
