camper
Camping, as defined above, is the strategy of sitting in a single stragic spot, waiting for someone to come into your vision, however, it should be noted that camping is not always a fair strategy. ; Some campers will camp an area where it is nearly impossible to be killed if they refuse to move. An example would be squating behind a box in an enclosed room with a single entrance. An opponent would have to position himself infront of the doorway without any cover, and try to hit the small ammount of the camper that is visible. In this way, the camper can get kill after kill, even when his position is known, and in 1 on 1 matches, this would become very frustrating and ruin the game for the opponent.
