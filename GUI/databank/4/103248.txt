cheese sandwich
Defines the plain and unexciting, based on the perceived dullness of an actual cheese sandwich. Often used in a relationship sense - i.e. a male/female who may be underachieving in terms of the attractiveness of their partner. In a more simple form, can be used by self-styled [playas] to question the excitement factor of committed, long-term relationships in general.
