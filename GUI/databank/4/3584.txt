scally
Although usually violent and vicous creatures, who pray on nicotene and the rare 'Kebab', there are many docile versions of the standard scallie Xenomorph which have been recently discovered. These tame scallies also called 'Scallets' will keep they're distance from other human bioforms such as packs of 'emos' and gaggles of 'goths', they will instead take to smoking in there bedrooms and eventually end up dying in gutters due to excessive consmption of halluceonegenic drugs. A shame considering most 'Scallets' are quality people who want nothing more than to live peaceful, smoke filled life cycles.
