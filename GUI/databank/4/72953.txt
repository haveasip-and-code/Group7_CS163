chonger
A dirty, greasy Latino male who loves to act tough and mean, but is often perceived as an individual who lacks proper hygiene and is not nearly as threatening as a [cholo], which appears to be the same by physical appearance. They usually have on white shirts, gold chains, long blue jean shorts, white socks up to the knees, and some kind of tennis shoe. Chongers are often looked down upon, as they usually look the part but are all talk and no fight.
