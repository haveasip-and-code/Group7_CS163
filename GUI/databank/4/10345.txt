Super Nova
Safer Sephiroth's fuckin move which takes 5 minutes to complete, but is awesome. And for some reason, sephiroth gets engulfed by the sun, in which he is granted no pain or suffering, however, cloud gets burninated of course. Word of advice, beat the damn game b4 he uses supernova twice, otherwise you will get the glitch ending for some odd fucking reason in which you will not receive any full motion video. I consider it to be an alternate ending, and it is kind of cool if you happen to get this ending first becuz it leaves it very much open and leaves you guessing what exactly happened. Anyway, i gotta shit, im out.
