sangwich
Slang for 'sandwich'. Frequently used by individuals of Italian, Puerto Rican, and Latino descent. The influence of these cultures has spread this alternative pronunciation for the tasty bread-and-meat combination throughout western U.S. jail and prison systems. Convicts from nearly any racial and ethnic background are now commonly found using this particular word.
