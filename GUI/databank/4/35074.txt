turn game
A game (usually played on a bus) in which two opponents try to push each other as far into the aisle/window as possible whenever the vehicle makes a turn on the attacking opponent's side. The defending opponent has to either keep himself from falling into the aisle and being embarrassed or keep his body from being crushed severly against glass and metal.
