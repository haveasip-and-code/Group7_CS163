Command & Conquer
Command & Conquer(sometimes written '[Command and Conquer]') is a large series of games created by the now-defunct [Westwood Studios]. Command & Conquer is one of the most critically acclaimed [real-time strategy] games, spawning several a few sequels, prequels, a handful of add-on packs, and various ports to 32-bit and 64-bit video game consoles. You play the part of either the [Global Defense Inititive]([GDI]) or the [Brotherhood of Nod]([Nod]) in your mission of taking control of the world through force. You build your bases and rally your forces, then promptly obliterate the opposing side as brutally as you can, leaving no survivors. It's basically a futuristic war game, in the most rudimentary definition. The most recent game(listed below) truly pales in comparison to the earlier titles due to the fact that [EA Games] habitually puts quantity over quality. ; Abbreviations: CnC, C&C ; Game Hierarchy: ; Command & Conquer: [Tiberian Dawn], [the Covert Operations], and [Sole Survivor] ; Command & Conquer: [Tiberian Sun] and [Firestorm] ; Command & Conquer: [Renegade] ; 'Prequels': ; Command & Conquer: [Red Alert], [Counterstrike], and the [Aftermath] ; Command & Conquer: [Red Alert 2] and [Yuri's Revenge] ; Other: ; Command & Conquer: [Generals] and [Zero Hour]
