Sasha
She's the coolest girl you'll ever meet. She's fun to be around and is always there to help you when you need it. She's sexy and is confident about herself. She's shy and loud all at the same time. She's always hanging out with her friends. She's seen a million movies and read a million books. She's caring and passionette. She's afraid of what will happen if she spills her secrets, yet she's willing to do it. Its all because she's in [love] with a really cool guy (who just happens to be one of her really good friends) Sadly, he just hasn't noticed so he doesn't know it yet.
