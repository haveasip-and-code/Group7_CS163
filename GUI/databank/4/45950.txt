magnet theory
when to people who are going out are annoyingly inseperable, everywhere they walk you see the two of them so close together, it's almost like they have magnets in their heads attaching them. VERY annoying. this theory was invited by mr.gearhart's 2004-2005 advisory and applies to a few'couples at lakeside
