ger
when you hear someone with a strong latin accent speak,and they say 'your' it sounds like ger!! but the word ger somehow transformed into a nickname that means 'the love of my life...my other half!its just like your calling someone by their name except you say ger! so if your lucky enough to call somone your ger then let them know what it means!!!
