MTVictim
1. Anyone who watches, buys a record from a band on, or goes to a concert featuring a band on MTV or modern music radio. ; 2. Anyone with the audacity to fancy themselves a 'Thug', 'Goth', 'Trendy', 'Teeny Bopper', 'Skank', 'Punk', 'Raver', 'Prep', 'Skater', 'Jock' or member of any other corporately solicited teenage social caste. ; MTVictims are no different then each other, nor are they 'expressing themselves' like the suits want them to believe. MTVictims are no smarter then each other. MTVictims are all part the lowest common denominator of society. ; But look on the brightside you're all part of the majority.
