their eyes were watching god
A book containing many very annoying black southern colloquialisms, with a horrible storyline about a black woman's oppressed life. Of course, she has to throw in a bunch of sexual innuendos involving pear trees, flowers, and bumblebees. If you like reading about a little town called Eatonville where only blacks live, and people from miles around gather to see the new lamppost installed, you'd love this book. If you 're anything like a cognitive human being that requires some kind of respectable theme or decent storyline to enjoy something, stay far away from this book.
