West Hall
Now called Alumnae Hall (lame...), the big dining hall that serves the entire Mount Hermon campus of [NMH]. If you look slightly different from the Hermon norm, it's likely that a [Hermonite] or two will stare at you as you walk in. The journey from door to food is called the Walk, and is feared by many. The food in West is perhaps better than that of [Gould] or [Marquand], but the atmosphere is sorely lacking.
