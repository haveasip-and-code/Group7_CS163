leadership
Leadership refers to the quality that a person or collection of people hold in which they command respect and are highly influential. However, leadership has shown to be highly overrated, in accordance with the numerous scandals and failures among leaders themselves. Leadership is frequently questionable and should be critically evaluated. Some psychologist groups argue that the 'born leader' also has a lot in common with people who suffer from narcissistic personality tendencies.
