fayette county
A county located in SWPA. It doesn't have much culture and the people in Fayette are very interesting. Walking down a street in Fayette is like walking through a zoo. Come to Fayette if you like interesting, eccentric people, but do not come to Fayette if you like art, music, or large cities. If you are a redneck, older person, biker, poor, tramp, slob, or a cOwGuRL111!! you just might like it in Fayette.
