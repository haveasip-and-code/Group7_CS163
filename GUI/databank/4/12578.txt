camden
Located across the Delawere River from Philadelphia, in South New Jersey; Camden was rated the most dangerous city in the United States circa 2004. There are more crimes committed per square mile than any other city in the U.S. Camden is poverish African American community and largely filled with ghetto row-homes that are barely standing.
