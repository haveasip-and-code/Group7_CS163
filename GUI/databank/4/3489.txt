napoleon dynamite
A movie that outlines the absolute absurdity of Western culture and the American Dream, also the meaninglessness of even existing to begin with. No, it is not meant to be a comedy. And no, it is not 'flippin' sweet'. Sure, there are funny quotes. For example: ; 'Who wants to bet I can go throw a football over them mountains?', 'Would you want a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys? .. Forget about it.', 'Why don't you go eat a decroded piece of crap?'(Yes, it was funny) ; There were several scenes in the movie that outlined the pointlessness of what I described earlier. The chicken silo where Napoleon works, the place where Napoleon buys D'Kwon's dance grooves, Napoleon's mormon school, and yes, even all of outdoors. The movie WAS indeed filmed in Idaho. The reason nobody liked it was because of the mass conformity everyone went through, kind of like a virus. The people that spouted idiotic quotes at every opportunity were a plague, and while thinking they were original, were actually conforming into one huge .. blob. This movie is not a comedy, it is an eye-opener, an enrichment of our own idealistic views and an insight into our meaningless existence. It is also inspirational in an oddly absurd way, but also depressing at the same time, thinking that someone like Pedro can win the class president race just by Napoleon dancing his D-Kwon dance(Which you can NOT repeat). Yes, he conquered the evils of Summer Wheatley, but it also made me sad thinking about the mindless peers these kids had, all voting like sheep. ; Napoleon's chronic lying and story-telling made me laugh as well. In an odd way, he was either extremely cool or extremely uncool. In the eighties and early nineties, he would have been considered extremely uncool. But now, he would have been considered a God. His lying adds to the big picture. It shows an example of him lying to escape his miserable existence. ; Sheer genius.
