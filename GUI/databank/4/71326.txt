stinkditch
Ass crack. In reference to the fleshy crevice (hence ditch) of the human body that contains the exit portal of our excretory system. Malodiferous intestinal gases are commonly exhausted from this area and fecal remenants can also contribute to unpleasant aromas, hence the term 'stinkditch'.
