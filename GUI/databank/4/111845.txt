fappo
[War cry] declared right before collision with an object. Similar to '[cowabunga],' '[oh shit]' and that [George of the Jungle] yell which-I'll-be-damned-if-I-can-spell-out. ; The term was made famous on the [internet] by a [photoshopped] [Spider-Man] comic strip in which our hero mistakes an overturned [truck] for his long-term [arch-nemesis] and proceeds to assault the truck by rope-swinging straight into the side of it.
