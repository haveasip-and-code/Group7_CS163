Nurofen Plus
A wicked little pill developed by Boots and making them a fortune that has/had many of us hooked as it is available over the counter in the UK and has codeine. It does relax you but it dries you up (nose, throat and elsewhere), makes you tired, constipated and takes away your sex drive. Your body builds up a resistance to it so you have to take more and more to get the same buzz. It's just not worth it.
