Head Royce
A school where for 22,000 a year you can lose sight of everything truly important in life and be taught that 1) money is everything 2) you are better than everyone else ever. EVER. 3) you have to kill to get ahead. It's a guarantee you will make bundles of money someday but have the same amount of fun as a survivor from Auchwitz.
