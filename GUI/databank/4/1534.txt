grungers
A group of people who do exactly what they claim not to. They go around saying - 'We're grungers, we don't follow anybody's fashion rules - we wear what we want' (or something similar) And then they go and spend all their money on baggy trousers and boxes of safety pins in order to look exactly the same as their grungie companions. Then they go and make fun of the people who do exactly the same as them but with tight trousers and gold earrings. ; (The only grungers who this does not apply to are the ones who don't go around saying 'I'm a grunger'.)
