Times Square
A section of midtown manhattan on west 42nd street. It is known for its bright lights, and carnival like appearence. It is currently the home to the theater industry, and formerly, the sex industry. It is also a major contributor to the tourist industry. Until the 1990's, times square was seedy. Times square has been home to streetwalkers and showgirls since the beginning of the 20th century. In the 80's, crack made times square a very dangerious place. In the 90's, Mayor Guliani transformed it from a red light district/ theater place, into a very tacky, disny like bunch of streets.
