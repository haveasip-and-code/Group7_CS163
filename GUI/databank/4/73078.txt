Indiana University
1. The most underrated school in the nation in every aspect. Not only is it the best damn party school in the nation, but it is also a sensational school for academics. It has top ten programs in business, journalism and psychology so never underestimate the Hoosiers. At this remarkable school alcohol is taken down like it is nothing and never stops coming. It is also home to Little 500 which is undoubtedly the most insane week of partying on any college campus in the world. If you are not aware of this then you should get off your ass and come to Bloomington, Indiana to see the best university in the world!
