The only neighborhood in America were you can hear lasgo blocks away blasting from the cars of fort hamilton high school kids along 3rd ave. A place where you can get drunk at mooneys and eat greasy burgers at the americana. Bayridge is the place to be on a friday night, pass by omonia you'll know wat im talkin about. And the best block in bayridge is 68th street, only the strong survive on that block.
