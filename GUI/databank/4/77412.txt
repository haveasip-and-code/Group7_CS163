las lomas high school
a typical suburbia high school with just about every race and a lot of them. white people, though, dominate the school. half the student body gets wasted each weekend, but the school somehow maintains good academic standing and good prospects for college. being next to downtown creates a fun atmosphere, but forces many 'cool' people to go to the city, San Francisco, instead. Huka seems to be the most popular drug, with weed and alcohol as close followers. Somehow, these kids get a hold of crack, but let's not go there. Some of the knights believe they are ghetto (especially the Mexican crowd). Anyways, overall a good school.
