mapcore
Mapcore started in 2000, as a community of Half-Life level designers and texture artists. Since then, core members of this community have contributed to almost every major half-life mod, including Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat. Several members of the community have even gone on to professional careers in game development and contributed to titles such as Brothers in Arms, Vampire: Bloodlines and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. ; Today mapcore is a group of people, both amateur and professionals who share the same passion of game design and development on all platforms and engines. Through the website presence at www.mapcore.net and the irc channel, the aim was to provide a community for developers to socialize, learn, teach, and draw talent from.
