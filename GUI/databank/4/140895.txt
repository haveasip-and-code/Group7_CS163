suck licker
Insulting term ejaculated by my boss towards the driver of a vehicle on the other side of the road who suddenly lurched onto our side of the road just as we were passing. This shouted response took us both by surprise even more than the erratic driving of the offender. In hindsight we often marvel at the way this combination of words conveys the deep insult of phrases such as [cocksucker] and [ass-licker], while technically implying only that the object of displeasure is capable both of sucking and licking (or really only of licking 'sucks', whatever a 'suck' is).
