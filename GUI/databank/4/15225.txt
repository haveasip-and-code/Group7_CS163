Sega Saturn
A video games console created by SEGA. It was the sucessor to the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive. The Saturn was 32-bit and the games were stored on CDs, opposed to the catridges from before. ; Sega planned to bring out a new console that would have the 'most advanced 2D graphics ever' but after seeing the specs for the new Sony Playstation, they had to have a serious re-think. The new Sega console, called SEGA Saturn, was given more chips that meant it could compete with the Playstation, but it was highly difficult to devlop for. ; The console didn't sell very well at all, especially in America. Multiple software delays and a lack of games from 3rd party publishers meant not many bought it. The console was only a real sucess in Japan. ; The Saturn could do much better jobs of 2D games than any other console, but the 3D games would often looks worse than Playstation. ; However the Saturn has become a collector's prized possesion in recent years with a big market available. ; Key games for the Saturn include Nights, SEGA Rally, Street Fighter Alpha 2, Radiant Silvergun, Virtua Fighter 2 and Panzer Dragoon Saga.
