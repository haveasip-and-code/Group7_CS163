Longhorn
The update to Windows XP/2000. ; Seems like a good version of windows, until you see the roadmap... Microsoft plan to launch a SP... shows how much faith they have in Windows. ; The 2 main problems we meet with longhorn ; 1) Its gona get so many virus'... your fucked ; 2) you will need a new computer to run it, because todays 'mid-range' PCs arnt powerfull enough to run it.
