Cloth eared bint
From the definition of [bint], a cloth eared bint would be a loose term for a stupid bloke who thinks that women aren't lisening to him. and he would be right. wench can also be applied, or so claire says. emma thinks claire and dave make ou go aaahhhhh. and hib thinks the same. hib makes emma go aahhh.
