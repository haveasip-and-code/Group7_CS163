F.R.A.P.
Frenetic Random Activity Pattern. A behavior often exhibited by puppies or young dogs wherein the animal, without an apparent reason, suddenly runs at high speed, frantically darting in multiple directions then racing to a sudden stop. These episodes generally last 60-90 seconds at most. In general the puppy will appear very pleased with itself. May happen indoors or out.
