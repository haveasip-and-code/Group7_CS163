gym class heroes
Groundbreaking rock/hip-hop out of upstate New York. Works under the Fueled by Ramen record label and is known for their original lyrics, and their ability to make beats with real instruments instead of mixers and canned beats. Released their first LP, The Papercut Chronicles in February and i highly reccomend it.
