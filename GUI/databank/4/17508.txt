Paleophilia
An extremely rare sexual tendency/persuasion in which an individual experiences sexual arousal or lust from situations involving, concepts revolving around or depictions of dinosaurs and sometimes other large reptiles including dragons, lizards and/or snakes. These feelings may even be exclusive to these things depending on the person. ; Paleophiles are rarely very open about their somewhat 'unique' sexuality and while usually completely capable of having normal, loving relationships, they may experience difficulty in having a sexual relationship with another human being. Some of the tendencies Paleophiles/Herpiphiles have are: ; 1. They do not find the feminine breast or masculine hair attractive in the least, and are often repulsed or made uncomfortable by contact with it. ; 2. They are very physically reserved people, and shy away from intimate contact or sexual advances even from trusted partners ; 3. They experience almost no sexual arousal from media which most people may find arousing. ; 4. They are often ashamed of their sexual tendencies and hide them, limiting the scope of their sexual activities to their imagination and masteurbation. ; Contrary to what it may seem, paleophilia/herpiphiliacs are generally good people, who are fully capable of getting along with other people normally.
