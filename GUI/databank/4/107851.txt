Skinosis
A rare and often fatal disease of the skin, usually localized in the large extremities of the body. Skinosis is characterized by a rapid and prolonged deterioration of skin cells; a common skinosis patient will have several black or brown patches of decayed (or decaying) skin distributed sporadically around the area of infection. ; Although not contagious, studies have shown that skinosis has a fatal tendency to spread throughout the patient's body in a remarkably short period of time; often resulting in a complete loss of skin, and, ultimately leading to grotesque, saucy-red zombie-like patients; very close in appearance to some more severe burn victims. ; To this date there is no known cure for skinosis. Doctors and scientists around the world are currently working round the clock for a remedy, but thus far have made little progress. If you do happen to contract skinosis, consult a physician immediately. Depending on the severity of the case you may have to have a body part amputated to cut off the infection at the source.
