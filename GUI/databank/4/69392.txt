Seat Filler
A regular person used to fill up space (usually) in award shows so it looks like it's packed full with people. Whenever somebody gets up to accept an award, a 'seat filler' is ordered to sit in that seat. They're may also be used to seperate celebrities from others, as award shows have a very strict seating chart to avoid any problems.
