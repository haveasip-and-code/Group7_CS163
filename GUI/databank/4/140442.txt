Fuckdubbery
(adj., n.) ; A product that has been significantly altered and/or stripped of meaning, generally during the localization process from one language to another. Usually refers to something that has been dubbed into a country's native language rather of simply providing accurately translated subtitles. [Can also refer to horribly translated and/or censored subtitles, badly translated/censored comics, badly localized video games, etc.]
