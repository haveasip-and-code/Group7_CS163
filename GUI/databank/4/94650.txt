New York Dolls
The New York Dolls were [punk rock] before there was a term for it. Building on the Rolling Stones' dirty rock & roll, Mick Jagger's androgyny, girl group pop, the glam rock of David Bowie and T. Rex, and the Stooges' anarchic noise, the New York Dolls created a new form of [hard rock] that presaged both [punk rock] and ]heavy metal]. Their drug-fueled, shambolic performances influenced a generation of musicians in New York and London, who all went on to form [punk] bands. And although they self-destructed quickly, the band's two albums remained two of the most popular cult records in rock & roll history. ; All of the members of the New York Dolls played in New York bands before they formed in late 1971. Guitarists [Johnny Thunders] and Rick Rivets, bassist Arthur Kane, and drummer Billy Murcia were joined by vocalist David Johansen. Early in 1972, Rivets was replaced by Sylvain Sylvain and the group began playing regularly in lower Manhattan, particularly at the Mercers Art Center. Within a few months, they had earned a dedicated cult following, but record companies were afraid of signing the band because of their cross-dressing and blatant vulgarity.
