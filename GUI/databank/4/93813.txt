Alimony
That wife you love so much, the little honey buns who you thought was an angel? Well, she's going to castrate you. Once she's done with that, she'll take your kids, put a restraining order on you with a false accusation, and then she'll take everything that rightfully belongs to YOU. After this, you must followed with a series of payments to support her, even if she is perfectly able to work. ; Yes, my friend, welcome to the world of alimony. You better pray that the child support (which WILL inevitably come) does not toss your castrated balls into the grinder to make food for the dogs.
