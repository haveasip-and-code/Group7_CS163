Megas XLR
Basiclly, american anime that involves a guy with a mecha, but is strictly a comedy. It is, by technicality, a cartoon, but relates more to anime(this is because the two makers are fans of anime). The show features the voices of Wendee Lee and Steven Jay Blum, basiclly, america's greatest voice-over actors. It is the greatest cartoon ever and shouldn't have been cancelled.
