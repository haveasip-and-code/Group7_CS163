Jack Off Jill
I'm sick of reading these incoherent definitions of JOJ, so I'll put in an accurate one. They're not metal or goth rock, and anyone who says they're either obviously knows nothing about either genre. Though Jessicka does scream, they're simply a rock band of mainly girls. They broke up in 2000 (not 2000) due to conflict between Jessicka and Robin because Robin thought she wasn't getting enough credit for JOJ. ; Marilyn Manson convinced her to change the name from Jack In Jill to Jack Off Jill, and he didn't persuade her while she was drunk OR in bed...It was simply through a hallucinating contest. Anyway, they've had a total of 12 members in the band, including Daisy from Manson's group. ; Since the band broke up, Jessicka has started a new band called Scarling., which is quite different and always ends in a '.'. ; Glad we've cleared all that up.
