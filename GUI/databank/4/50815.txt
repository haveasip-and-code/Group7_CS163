Meowth
Third member of [Team Rocket]. Meowth is a male Normal-type Pokemon. As a young kitten he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowsie, who was an absolute biatch. To impress her, Meowth worked his cute little ass off learning how to talk. Unfortunately those dang writers made Meowsie reject him anyway, he got sad and looked for a job.. He joined Team Rocket, an organisation devoted to stealing rare and valuable Pokemon, and was teamed up with rookie members Jessie and James. Since that day forth the infamous trio have been going about their daily lives, through a routine of Thunder-shocking/-bolting/-shetting and such and providing us (the audience) with much needed entertainment in this dull, lifeless repetition that is Pokemon. ; Long story short: Meowth is the coolest anime animal villain ever.
