Albertsons
A once respected grocery store chain started by a humble man, beloved and respected by his community for his fair business policies. ; New stores were constructed only after the money to pay for them was earned, and 'Better' was valued above 'Bigger.' ; Now a bloated shell of its former being, taking on debt faster than the Titanic took on water, and helmed by an ego and no longer a man. 'Bigger at any cost' valued over 'Better,' and their prices prove it.
