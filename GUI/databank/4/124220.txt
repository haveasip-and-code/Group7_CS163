The Edinburgh crips usually have a bagpiper present at their ceremonies and one usually lead them into battle in gang fights against rival gangs in Edinburgh. ; The music of a bag pipe is inspiring to Scottish people and rather repulsive to everyone else hence it is the ideal instrument to take into combat if you are Scottish because it will boost your morale and lower that of the enemy thus you will most likely be the victor of the conflict. ; The Edinburgh crips owe most thier conquests over rival gangs to the bagpipes.
