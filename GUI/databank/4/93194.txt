*crickets chirp*
Used to point out or emphasise silence. (Well, not precisely silence, since chirping crickets make sound. But you get it.) ; The idea is that you can only hear crickets when there are no other sounds, such as conversation or laughter. Often used to denote the awkward pause after a bad joke.
