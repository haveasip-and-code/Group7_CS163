Cathy Joseph Hollis IV
A slang term used throughout the south as example of an over-protective mother. Cajun Creole folklore has it that a mother by the name of Cathy was so over-protective of her son during his adolescences, that he went insane. One afternoon, the son snapped and went on a massacre, killing his mother, father, sister, and fellow pupils at the local schoolhouse. It is said that if you listen closely on southern fall nights, you can hear the whisper of Cathy's ghost.
