Necrid
An incredibly cheap, incoherent, and unnecessary character made by Todd McFarlane for the game 'Soul Calibur II' His strengths lies in a really his brute strength and cheap moves. His weapon is Maleficus, a ball of energy that lets him morph the energy into any kind of blade. He is annoying and stupid and should have been removed from the game since he really has no spot in the actual story line itself.
