Clam
The end result of a rare childbirh occurance where from some extra propulsion, the baby is launched out through the vagina, stops in mid-air when the umbilical cord reaches its full elasticity and is pulled back inside the mother through the vagina so fast and hard it pulls the lips apart until they're so wide they simply fall back and engulf the mother.
