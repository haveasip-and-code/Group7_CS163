kill skuls
A term created from the MMORPG City of Heroes. Was created from a person who was fooled by an individual who was taking advantage of for his benefit of xp leeching. Is now used as an evryday term to make fun of this incident. The main humor behind of this is how this guy even mispelled skulls, an (enemy group in City of Heroes). It is basically a fad for CoH players, kind of like the old fasioned All your base are belong to us
