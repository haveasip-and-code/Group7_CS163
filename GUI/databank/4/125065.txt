Bitch Goggles
Designer sunglasses of the feminine sort that scream wealth, glamour, and sophistication. The trend (as with most things trendy)seems to be the bigger, the better. In addition to blocking out rays from suns in distant galaxies, serving as a racoonine substitute for makeup, and masking your blood-shot, coke-glazed eyes from prying gazes; these sunglasses do tremendous wonders for the feminine mystique. Must have accessories include the latest model camera-phone, a lit cigarette (preferably menthol), ugg-style boots, and a frilly mini-skirt.
