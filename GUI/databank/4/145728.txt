falgene
Someone who is obviously carring around a fake Nalgene water bottle. This fake bottle could be made by various compagnies. (Brita, North Face etc..) Someone who carries around a falgene also listens to artists such as Ashlee Simpson, Simple Plan, and Avril Lavigne. Avoid these people at all costs.
