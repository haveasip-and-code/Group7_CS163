election
A kind of legitimised 'pick-an-asshole' competition held in certain countries that have democratic tendencies. In this 'election', a bunch of worthless bastards who wouldn't know a moral if it kicked them in the nuts and danced around them singing 'I'm a moral', lie through their teeth and kiss babies in an effort to suck at the public teat for another 3-4 years. Elections are characterised by weasels sticking their faces in front of cameras on a daily basis, a media frenzy that resembles dropping a steak into a piranha tank, and chronic voter nausea as they are forced to decide yet again between a potential disaster and a proven failure. Luckily, watching elections hasn't made me bitter about them...
