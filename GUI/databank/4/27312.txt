Santa Rosa
Beautiful city located 45 minutes north of San Francisco, nestled in the groin of the wine country. No extremes? Bullshit. triple digit heat in the summer, with evenings covered in fog. winter and fall very rainy. ; 90% caucasian. many white trash folks with pit bull mutts and no fear t-shirts. mullet hunting isn't even funny anymore here, there are so many. 'Rob' sounds like a prime candidate for 'fites'. ; popular question of 'what is there to do here?' and popular answer of 'drink' is complete bullshit. if you find the need to entertain yourself via alcohol or drugs, you're most likely extremely boring.
