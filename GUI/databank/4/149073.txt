nakama
The [Japanese] term for friend(s), buddy(ies), crew, ally(/ies) comrade(s), or gang. In the Japanese version of the [anime] [One Piece], this term has a deeper meaning, describing friends who are more like family, especially in the context of Luffy's crew. Because of this, many popular [fansubs] of it do not translate this term.
