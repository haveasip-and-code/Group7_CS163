Genesis
An awesome progressive/arena rock band formed in England during the early 1970s under Peter Gabriel and [Phil Collins]. When Gabriel finally left at the end of the 70s, Phil Collins soon took over as the band's frontman after countless auditions to find a new lead singer. It was the Phil Collins era in which Genesis experienced its highest popularity and greatest commercial success. The members of Genesis are still together, but their official active career ended during the mid-90s.
