pump it up
A dancing arcade game made by the Korean Company Andamiro after they saw [Dance Dance Revolution] and decided that it would be cool to make a similar version, but instead of the cardinal directions as dance steps, they made their dance pad with diagonal directions and a center step. While in Dance Dance Revolution, the steps on the screen are coloured differently if they are on the beat, the off beat, or eighth notes, Pump it Up has the upper two steps as orange, the lower two as blue, and the center as yellow.
