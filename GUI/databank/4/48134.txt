UD loser
People who try to submit ridiculous words/phrases to Urban Dictionary. Most often women with low self-esteem, or people who think they're [fly] or [chill], when in fact they're probably 16 year old kids who scream when they hear a gunshot, who think the world owes them something, by posting a definition of themselves to the effect of 'My name is X! I'm the best!' If you're ugly or lame, just face it.
