Tatehead
Another word for those known as scallies, chavs, charvers, spides, etc. This word originated in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, and is derived from '[Council] Estate - Head', though another theory on the origins of the word suggest it may have originated from the fact that the head of your average chav is about akin to a potato in intelligence, though this is less likely. The word was first heard to be used by a rather middle class young lad by the name of J. Moate.
