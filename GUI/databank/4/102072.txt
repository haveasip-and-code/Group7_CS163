Roy
1) An excellent character from [Super Smash Bros. Melee] who really needs to comb his hair. He's also got a huge, flaming weapon called the Sword of Seals. Please note that 'flaming' refers to the state of being on fire, and NOT the Urban Dictionary definition of [flaming]. Roy is much cooler than that. ; 2) An annoying [co-worker] who insists on spending his time trying to permanently destroy any last bit of sanity you may still possess.
