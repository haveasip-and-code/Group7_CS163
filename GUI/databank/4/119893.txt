Bush Babies
In the same context as [Baby Boomers], the generation of young conservatives born between 1988 and 2001 whose parents influence has made them fanatically right-wing, loyal to the Republican Party and George W. Bush espeicially, and will believe anything he says. A derogatory term, implying baseless yet extreme political views and a herd mentality, as well as sympathy for extreme militarism and nationalism.
