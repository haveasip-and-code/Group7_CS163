jewish piano
Wonderful old expression for a large, bronze cash register. It has many keys on the front. When you press a key, it 'rings up' the amount you pressed, and it rings a bell. You have to press several keys to 'ring up' a large amount of money. Each of these rings is beautiful music to any merchant. ; When you finish the 'song,' the Jewish Piano opens and you can put in all that wonderful money you just collected.
