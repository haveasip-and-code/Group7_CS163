machoegotism
A sadly incurable condition, usually occuring in young men. The sufferer of machoegotism strikes up an extraordinary relationship with himself (possibly due to excess masturbation) that results in the sufferer falling in love with themselves. They are incapable of replicating genuine feelings for others, though they attempt to hide their emotional vacuum by imitating feelings or responses. ; Treatments are being developed as you read this but scientists believe a cure is some way off. For now, temporary relief may be gaining by a sniff knee to the [happy sacks] or by telling them, in a way that is impossible to not understand, to fuck off.
