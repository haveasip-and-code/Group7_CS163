fraggle rock
A dance move developed on the West Coast. Involves slouching one's shoulders right over and staring at the ground with a fully bent-forward neck. The dancer steps stiffly to the beat with straight legs, and jingles his/her arms from the shoulder joints down as if loosening them up for exercise. Mostly used at weddings and political rallies.
