large, bulky ginger elephant looking creature with all of the verbal charecteristics of a 'mockney' - a cockney accent spoken by someone who i very much doubt has ever even seen the east end - can usually be spotted wearing the clothes of a chav, or geezer, and has a very distinctive mating call: 'Ere!!'
