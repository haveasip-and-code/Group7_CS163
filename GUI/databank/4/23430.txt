stone temple pilots
A rock quartet from the 90's. Also known as 'STP'. Comprised of a cool drummer, Eric Kretz, a druggy vocalist/lyricist, Scott Weiland, and two brothers: kick-ass bassist/songwriter Robert DeLeo and one of the best fucking rock guitarists in music history guitarist/songwriter Dean DeLeo. ; Thought to be ripping off Pearl Jam when they first appeared on the music scene but after later review are actually way fucking better than Pearl Jam. All their albums rock. Especially their debut 'Core', 'Purple' and 'No.4'.
