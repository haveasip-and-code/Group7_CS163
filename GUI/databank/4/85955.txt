-ify
Suffix (Specifically pronounced 'If-eye') which can be added most common dictionary words. Addition of 'ify' to a word changes existing form into a verb. For example, 'Hey, xyz, I am going to head off to go to bed' would be shortened to 'Hey xyz, I'm going to sleepify.' In cases where adding '-ify' to a word creates a conflicts with an existing dictionary word, such as 'Testify' (to take a test), the meaning is simply that which is implied during the course of discussion. However, if it is so wished, the speaker can replace '-ify' with '-inate' (and vice versa) with little change in meaning.
