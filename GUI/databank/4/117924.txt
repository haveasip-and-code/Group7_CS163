Poison
Poison is often scoffed at by music hipsters who listen to the Libertines and hate the fact that Death Cab made a major label album. But in the 1980's, Poison was constantly at the top of the charts and was one of the most popular bands of the time, on par with (look it up) Guns N Roses. The band's sleazy rock sound became synonymous with the Sunset Strip. Because the band wore makeup, they are frowned upon today, but mostly by people who have never heard their music. 'Talk Dirty To Me' off their first album, Look What The Cat Dragged In, is a prime example of why Poison was so successful and was a great rock band.
