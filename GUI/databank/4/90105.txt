holy trinity of classic rock
Led Zeppelin's untitled album, Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon,' and The Who's 'Who's Next.' These albums are regarded as the 'holy trinity of classic rock' for their overwhelming popularity, the quality of their music, and their contributions to the airwaves. The fact that songs from these albums may be overplayed on classic rock stations only cements their importance to the 'genre.'
