alternachav
The large 'dignified' group that fit in between the alternative groups such as punk, emo and indie, and the chav groups. Alteranchavs are easily identified by their high street clothes (New Look, Topman and River Island) and the fact that they always sit near the chavs at school, in hope of being 'promoted'. This is not to say that they know they want to be chavs, it is all a deep psychological need. If you need to identify an alternachav in a hurry, just ask them who The Shins are. Or shout out 'The chavs need a new cronie!' at the top of your voice.
