butt plug
n1: An anal device with a distinctive, rounded, conical shape that abruptly tapers off before reaching a flat, disc shaped bottom. The anus is gradually stretched until passing over the largest part of the device, after which the device abruptly tapers off to the disc shaped bottom, hence the 'butt' is 'plugged'. ; n2: An insult used to chastise someone who's behavior is annoying you and/or others. The insult infers that the person inflicting the annoyance on you and/or others is becoming as irritating as an unpleasant and unwanted experience of anal penetration.
