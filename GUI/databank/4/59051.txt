Pardon my French
The origin of this phrase (Which means excuse my use of profanity) does not originate for the French word for seal, as Lazy Time Waster suggests. ; It in fact originates from the constant warfare between England and France many years ago, at that time 'French' was associated with indecent things and activies (Swearing, kissing etc).
