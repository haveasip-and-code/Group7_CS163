Contrabass Clarinet
A rather large member of the clarinet family, the Contrabass Clarinet is in the key of B-flat, and is one octave below the [bass clarinet], which in turn is one octave lower than the regular B-flat [clarinet]. ; There are two types of Contrabass Clarinet- the Straight Contra and the Curved Contra. Curved Contrabasses are approximately two and a half feet long and doubles back on it self three, or sometimes four times. The straight contrabass clarinet does not double back on itself, and as a result is well over five feet in length. ; The contrabass clarinet is not often used, as it is a rather rare instrument, but when it is used, it usually doubles with the [Contrabassoon], or the regular [Bassoon].
