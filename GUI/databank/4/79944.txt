Yunalesca
A character from the video game, Final Fantasy X. She was the one who granted a summoner the power of the 'Final Aeon', by sacrificing on of the guardians with them on the summoner's pilgramige. The 'Final Aeon' is the only thing that they thought of to defeat sin, but of course, the sacrifice of a person was harsh, and sin was revived anyways eventually after a period they called 'The Calm' In Final Fantasy X, Yuna and her guardians defy that rule, and try to find another way to defeat sin.
