Yahoo-Fag
A person on yahoo that thinks hacking is coding and using yahoo booters and crackers. There much like a script kiddy in real hacking. They also partake in such things as collecting 'yahoo illys', and starting crews of other people just like them. Much of them run windows and have no idea what real hacking is. Alot of smart people leave yahoo to get away from these people.
