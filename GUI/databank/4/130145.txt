slash fasting
A period in which one, usually a [yaoi fangirl], gives up [yaoi] or [slash] for one month. It is very helpful treatment for those without lives. ; It started when Lii decided that her life had become way too centered around something that didn't accomplish anything, and gave it up. She was born a new woman. ; The original and traditional period to fast is the month of October, starting on Bloody Sunday (the last Sunday in September) and ending on All-Slashers Day, which is Halloween. All-Slashers Day is not usually full of feasting and parties, for the transition of normal human being to rabid fangirl takes time. ; Other months work also, depending on your events. October doesn't work well due to intense popularity of [The Rocky Horror Picture Show] during this month. Late Spring could be an option, but it hasn't been tested.
