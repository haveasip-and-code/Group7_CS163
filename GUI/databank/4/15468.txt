Books
Did you know there HAVE been books printed since the fifties and the new ones are cool? They have them so anyone can understand them. Books can be about video games, sex, drugs, sports, people, pretty much everything. They come with cuss words, funny characters and you might understand some more of you those weird things...that's right. Words.
