stooge-o-matic transmission
An automotive transmission built for people who don't know how to shift gears, such as old granny ladies, [mush wimp]s, effeminate males, [soccer mom]s, and [yuppie] twits. This transmission has no clutch, and uses a torque converter. ; People who don't know how to drive get stooge-o-matic transmissions, and therefore never learn how to drive. They put their brakes on for random cosmic events. They put their brakes on going down hills. You should see all the [pantywaist] stooge-o-matic drivers with burnt-out brakes on the roads in the Rocky Mountains!
