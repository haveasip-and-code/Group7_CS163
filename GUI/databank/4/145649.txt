chavelry
jewelry for chavs, this so called chavellry is usually thick chains which have been spray painted gold, often wwon out of the ten pence machines in the entrance of supermarkets and over shops, often they were more than one item of jewelry to gain the chav~alicious look, personly i fail to see the apeal in chavelry and would avoid chavelry and chavs at all costs, they tend to spit on people
