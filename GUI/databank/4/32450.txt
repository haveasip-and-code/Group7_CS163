bay area
99% of the time this talks about the NORCAL bay area and not the other bay areas. Known for Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose, East Palo Alto, and Richmond. Where the reall ballers lay. Underground rap capital of the USA from frontline to keak da sneak to e-a-ski we runnin things out here. Oh and nobody says yay area, i used to live in east palo alto and from all the slang out there i never heard anyone say yay area and i still dont, so dont say it please. Oh and nobody says Frisco San Fran is what its usually called.
