tae kwon do
A great martial art for all ages, has alot of ideas from several other types of martial arts. It's also an official Olympic sport. It's main focus is on kicks, and there aren't many different types of punches or punch combos that you learn. And whoever said that it's the weakest martial art ever, I would like to meet you so I can prove you wrong.
