Grover Cleveland
(noun) the name given to one of those relationships that seemingly everyone must go through at least once in their lifetime in which the two parties break up and get back together a countless number of times. During those longer 'broken up' periods, they cannot bring themselves to have feelings for anyone else but can still hook up or 'hook up' with others. Also referred to as a person's 'first love relationship.' Generally the relationship when one or both parties loses their virginity but not always.
