Kooloruni
A word invented in the childrens show 'Rocket Power' on the show it is used stupidly, however a way has been found to use it in an effective manner, therefore it is now defined as: ; 1) A guitar solo where you can clearly hear fret tapping ; 2) When you are mocking someones intellegence as a joke you may say how he/she is right that is truly kooloruni
