el jimador
'El Jimador' is the name given to the experienced farmers who select and cultivate the unique Blue Agave Plant, the raw material of true Tequila. This plant, Nature's most precious gift to Mexico, takes ten years of careful cultivation to reach maturity. It is hand picked and cropped, and it takes a fine eye to select the quality Agave which is used for Tequilas.
