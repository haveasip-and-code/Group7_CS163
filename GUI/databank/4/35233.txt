limp bizkit
One of the greatest bands of the last 20 years (along with Disturbed, Lamb of God, Soilwork,In Flames, Amon Amarth, Trivium, System of a Down etc). ; The unchallenged kings of all Nu Metal ever. ; Comprising of: ; -The kickass vocal skills of Fred Durst. ; -The insane drum skills of John Otto (only matched by Joey Jordison of slipknot) ; -The unreal mixing skills of DJ Lethal ; -The supreme thrash master himself, Wes Borland ; -The lord of bass, Sam Rivers ; 95% of the fags who just ripped of Limp Bizkit in their definitions are lame ass trend following retards who have anger problems resulting from excessive teabagging they got from their dads.
