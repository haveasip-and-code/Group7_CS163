Blatt
This is straight from Russian: 'Blatt' is slang for a hooker. It is also a very insulting curse word, regardless of it's meaning, and a word that is used to express frustration or anger (much like 'Fuck' in English). Since it's use is so common by some who speak Russian, it became very popular and common in Hebrew slang as well, for the same reasons described under [Gandon].
