Slippy
Anthropomorphic frog and worst Starfox pilot. Demands help in getting out of anything from shaking off Andrew (the worst Star Wolf pilot) to shaking off two pathetic drones that could easily be destroyed by a somersault followed by a single charged laser blast. Offers completely useless advice in Star Fox Adventures.
