l337
Originally used as a term by many online hackers, l337 simply spells 'Leet' shortened from 'elite' through use of numbers. l337 can also be used to describe the use of speech in which numbers commonly replace letters. (Such as saying r0x instad of rocks, or 0wn3d instad of owned.) Online gaming addicts tend to use such speech more often.
