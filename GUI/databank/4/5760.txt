The most overrated album of all time. It is a band, like Mars Volta, that has been accepted as 'a good band'. I.e., it's a safe band to like, because it's commonly accepted as 'good music'. ; The album is simply average. Everyone is just fucking insane about Radiohead because they haven't heard enough music.
