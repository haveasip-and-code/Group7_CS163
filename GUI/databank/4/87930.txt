A Dance Party that involves great music such as Jesse McCartney, Hanson, Kelly Clarkson, Backstreet Boys, and more. ; The Dance Party also has to include Butch and Bob, with appearances by the Martin Sisters, Dan, Tank, Tom, Pauley, and Tim (not Wal-Mart.) Sometimes it is located around a car with music playing from the car stereo, but it is best when it is in close quarters in mosh-pit form, with music surrounding the party.
