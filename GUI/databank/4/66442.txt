Micheal Moore
Someone who continually proves his facts. Yet everyone blindly hates him because 'oh no, he doesn't support Our President, he must be a liar.' On His website, you will find proof that what he says is true. Everyone is saying that he hates America, which is not true at all. He hates Bush, and the lies he spreads. He does not hate the rest of the country.
