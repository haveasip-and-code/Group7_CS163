trendies
Well Im apparently what would be classed as a 'trendy' and im gunna put sum stuff str8... ; Ye, the gals are obsessed with makeup and stuff but so what, Just cuz they want to look nice, most of the girls are really unconfident anyway and for them its the easiest way to cover it up. Theyre not 'slags' theyre just livin life and havin fun. ; The lads are idiots mostly and i agree totally, theyre immature but funny and are also obsessed with football and other sports that involve balls (which they havent actualy got so it makes up for it!)Oh and they dont all like darkness they actually have different tastes like u! I know, I know.. amazin isnt it! ; And another that pisses me off is that all people like goths n stuff say tht we are sheep and 'follow' each other in what we wear but if thats true then surley goths are sheep to because they all follow each other and wear and what they listen to? Im not one of those ppl who call ppl different to me, in fact it pisses me off as much as it duz u Im just proving a point that theyre not all what you think and are actually nice ppl, after all everyones got their own oppinions and views so think what u want Im just provin ma point!
