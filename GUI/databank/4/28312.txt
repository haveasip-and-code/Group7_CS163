enneagram
The enneagram is composed of nine basic types, wings, and instincts. For example, someone could be a 5 with a 4 wing and a self-preserving instinct. There are two possible wings for either type (one or the other, or both...or neither), three possible instincts, or no instinct or wing at all. Therefore, there are not 9 types or 81 in total, but 288 (9x2x4x4).
