pickford
Pickford was played by [Shawn Andrews] in the 1993 film [Dazed and Confused]. Kevin Pickford was Michelle's boyfriend who dealt pot for a living, so he could pay off the car dealership who sold him his 1970 Pontiac GTO. In the film he drove around in his [rad] car getting wacked out on weed, and destroying private property. As you can tell by closely watching his [countenace] during the film, he spent most of his time in la la land, off in his own imagination. Very expressive eyes, I'll give him that.
