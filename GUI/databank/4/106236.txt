bmore
the abbreviation for Baltimore that stupid people from Baltimore use (Baltimorons). Everyone from Baltimore who refers to it as 'bmore' thinks it's paradise on Earth. They think they are smarter, have more money, and better in every way possible than anyone else. In fact Baltimore county is quite the blue collar working class area and the city itself is one of the most ghetto ass places you will ever see in your life. Admittedly there are a few upper middle class areas such as Owings Mills. But Owings Mills has absolutely nothing on pretty much all of Montgomery County(aka MoCo)except hickville Damascus and ghetto ass Silver Spring. Also the reason everyone with half a brain from Baltimore goes to a private school is that the Baltimore public schools are absolute shit. The only good things that 'bmore' actually has to offer are the Orioles and the Inner Harbor. Besides that there really is nothing else. Oh and by the way crab cakes are not exclusively a Baltimore thing as many Baltimorons like to think. They are a Maryland thing.
