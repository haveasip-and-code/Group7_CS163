outpost
The tenth circle of hell. So horrendious it was left out of Dante's Inferno. ; The Outpost is home to the mose heinous creatures imaginable. ; Only the most sinful of people are sent to the Outpost where they remain for all eternity. ; They edure pain equal to being burned alive in a pit of lava with needles stuck into every nerve.
