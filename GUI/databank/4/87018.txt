crowded house
1. Awesome band from New Zealand. The driving force in the band was Neil Finn with some support from his elder brother Tim Finn. The band earned a lot of RESPECT!! from fans all over the world and colleagues in the music business. The band broke up in 1996, but Neil and Tim are still in business with several solo projects and musical collaberation
