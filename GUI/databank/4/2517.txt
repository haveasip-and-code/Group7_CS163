Civic
A car that spanks mustangs, camaros, firebirds.... etc. usually costs more to make it do so but will still save gas and insurance money + your mom never has to know about. Usually seen in urban racing making old ppl cry for buying 05' $50,000 Vettes getting doors blown off by a slightly used 98' civic with a $2000 engine, a few mods, and ricer accessories.... if needed a $2000 turbocharger and still save more gas, insurance , as well as fit 3 more ppl in the back. basically the reason why civics get stolen faster/on a more needed basis and heavier than any other car on the planet. Also if the cops are watching im coppin ( means everyone wants what the cops hate ) ; Want proof ? goto any urban race scene, track, etc.
