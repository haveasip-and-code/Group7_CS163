Laguna
1. Man whom was pyscically linked to Squall Leonheart, when he was being shown the past, in a futile effort to change it. ; 2. Word used by Moombas, both to express their love for the man Laguna, and as a general expression of pure randomness. Through this we can see that they share a loyalty and stupidity commonly associated with Fighters, and that makes them cool :)
