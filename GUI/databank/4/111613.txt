eggplant
A person of Sicilian heritage. This term is derogatory in that it points out to Sicilians how they have African blood flowing through their veins. Etymologically, this term derives from the 9th century conquest of the Sicilian island by the Moors, who, for all those ignorant folks out there, were in fact African.
