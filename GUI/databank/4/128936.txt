pinoy
A Pinoy is a filipino man. A Pinay is a filipino woman. Get it? Oh ya and by the way filipinos are NOT pacific islanders... who the hell said that we were any way? the Philippines are in the map in ASIA not near Hawaii where Samoan or Tajisian people are! and yes people... believe it or not filipinos ARE asian.
