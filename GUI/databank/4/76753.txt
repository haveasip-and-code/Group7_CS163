Myspace
it's 3:45 AM, your eyes are sore form looking at the computer screen for 4, no wait 5 hours...uhh who cares because all you care about not is myspace. You log into your Myspace everday, you've even missed the funeral of your mother to read that message from that attractive scene girl from Peluca, Idaho. Speaking of scene kids. Out of the 4,543 friends you have you only know about 70 personally, but for some unholy reason you know every single scene kid on your myspace, though the SONS O' Bitches all look alike. Your life is in shambles due to your Myspace addiction. You go to work tired, thus becoming cranky. In meetings all you can think about is what bulletins people have posted or what cool neat comments you have. ; For all those reason you lose your job. Why? Because when you were at your nice doctors job at the Children's Hospital instead of writing needs Chemo-Therapy ASAP, you wrote, 'PLZ comment on my pics!@@!' ; At this point you're at home it's been three months since you lost your job, now you live with you mother all your real friends have left you, because now you have alienated them for your MYspace friends. Just another statistic. ; Please if you don't get help at CHARTER, Please get help somewhere.
