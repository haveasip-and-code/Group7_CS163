Pool
A highly complex game played by highly intelligent people. All players play on a table, placing their coins on the edge. The object is to hit your opponent's coins off of the table. ; Players who use extra large coins (such as half-dollars) are usually considered '[douchebags]' and lose anyways. Such players also tend to wear flannel pants. ; Obstacles, such as milk cartons, can be thrown in for extra difficulty.
