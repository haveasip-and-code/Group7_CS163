Teenager
people ages 13-17. adolescents. most usually go through depression. most teens have 'normal' and 'cool' standards that you are forced to live up to if you are a teen: ; 1) you have to have a girlfriend/boyfriend otherwise you are gay (i dunno why teens call eachother gay even when they are straight) ; most relationships at this time are based on insecurity, these are the reasons anyone would want to have a girlfriend: ; 1) rid of the pressure of being called gay or other stupid comments ; 2) show off ; 3) get closer to the other person than just a friend can ; relationsips these ages are only based on looks, not whats on the inside. today, you have to be good looking and have bigs tits and ass otherwise you are considered unworthy by some moron who will eventually dump you for someone else! ; 2) you must smoke, drink, and have sex (funny how such morally wrong things are considered godly by teens) ; 3) you can't wear '[whity tighties]' or you will be dissed by most [boxer] wearers who have smaller d***s than you ; (i wear [boxer-briefs]) ; 4) you must hate your parents ; i am conservative and a teen. i went to school with these kind of morons. their rules control you and u cant do anything about it. while they bitch about how 'popular' they are they are the most insecure. while you, the 'unpopular' kid becomes sucessful in life, its usually the 'cool' kids that will be flipping burgers
