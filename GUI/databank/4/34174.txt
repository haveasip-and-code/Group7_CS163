blidge
Blidge is a (presumably) made-up word that the Thievery Corporation used a song called 'Lebanese Blonde.' ; In the first verse, the lyric is 'the clouds drifting through the blinds'; in a later verse, words and phrases are replaced with others that are phonetically similar, and the lyric becomes 'the clouds drifting through the blidge.'
