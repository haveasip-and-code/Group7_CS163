froder
Note: There is some debate as to whether this word is to be spelled froder or froader. ; A froder is an individual who is an off-roading enthusiast (hence the name, which is a truncated version of 'offroader'). A froder isn't truely a froder just because he/she (more often than not, the term froder is regarding a male) enjoys off road activities. Southern California is the native land of the froder. Froders can be identified by their usually white, VERY large raised ford trucks. Often times these trucks have their fronts raised more than the rear, which serves little purpose other than to make the froder in question look like a [retard]. An additional note is that when one encounters a froder vehicle whilst driving, it is adviseable to stay out of their way. Froders generally feel that the raised height of their truck gives them free reign to drive fast and in a wreckless fashion. ; Froders also generally wear a lot of [srh] clothing and adorn their beloved trucks with srh stickers. Also, froders tend to use Olde English scripting in their car stickers and clothing. Scholors don't really know why this is, but some say that they resemble tattos and convey the lifestyle of the froder, and still other say that froders are just stupid and think that it looks fancy and neato. ; Froders are also known as bro's, and date [broho]s. Broho's are generally [skanky] blonde women who wear a lot of FOX, SrH and Skin Industries clothing. They are attracted to the lifestyle of the froder, that is the lifestyle of large trucks and copious amounts of alcohol. These people are generally looked down upon because they end up as alcoholics/crystal meth addicts and usually crap out 3 or 4 kids by the time they are 21 which the taxpayer then has to take care of.
