Hal
A tall, assholish poser who puts down people shorter and different than he is, one with a band of suck ups that make him feel so good about himself. Tommy, his right hand man copies whatever Hal does and has no mind of his own, and when he is wrong, doesn't admit to it, Charlie thinks Hal is the coolest guy in the world because he has a mohawk...Charlie also never washes his hair. Hal treats girls nice to their faces but badly behind their backs.
