pootycrew
The first ever 'chat crew' on internet voice chat. Founded in 1998 by pootycrew1 and pooty_master_69. Many other chat crews formed after the founding of the Pooty Crew and there were even crew 'wars' from 2000-2003. A group of people united for a similar purpose in a chat room, usually talking about insane subjects.
