Metal
Metal can only be described as the best genre ofmusic to ever hit the earth. Metal derived from the hard rock popular in the late 60s such as Led Zepplin and turned into Black Sabbath and Alice Cooper in the 70s. Continually accused of being Satanist and listening to Metal or wearing band T-shirts made people targets for police. More bands followed like Iron Maiden in the ealy 80s. Then Speed and Death metal came along when Metallica, Slayer and Megadeath showed up. In the mid 80s Gwar came out and took the stage show to the max with fake decapitations and blood spewing everywhere. In the early 90s (93-94) Melodic Death Metal bands came out of Scandanavia like In Flames and Children of Bodom. Then came along Nu Metal a.k.a Mallcore. Nu metal includes Slipknot, Korn Manson. System of a Down is slightly Nu Metal but more harcore punk-metal. Progreessive metal bands like Tool don't have the same style as other forms of metal but can still retain the heaviness of metal.
