Northampton
Large industrial town in the center of England. In the past Northampton has had a rich history and also was the site of one of the key battles of the War of the Roses. ; Now sadly Northampton has changed. It has become a townie ( read definition) breeding ground, and is a dangerous place for any who do not follow their way of life. ; We Northamptonians seem to have a mild accent compared to other areas but still seem to make our a's sound more like ey. The older natives of Northampton and the surrounding area have a tendancy to call people 'me duck' pronounced 'meh duck'. ; Northampton is rapidly expanding and has a strong rivalry with nearby town Milton Keynes. ; The townie population of Northampton, who also happen to make up a large amount of Northampton Town FC 'the cobblers' supporters. Being sadly lacking in intellingence for the most part, these people now despise any who live in the towns of Millwall, Peterborough, Rushden (strong hatred there) and pretty much any town with a football team in the same division as them. ; Nightime in Northampton is not glamourous, but the townies and the closely related, but generally richer and better looking 'trendies' see it as the highlight of their lives. Scores of young girls, wearing pink short skirts, skimpy black tops and stumbling around half drunk laughing their heads off at something as insignifficant as tripping on a curb can be seen. ; Males often and try and gel their hair into some form of modern style, regardless of receeding hairline. They mainly wear Ben Sherman clothing and many will wear much smaller versions of what the townies refer to as 'bling'. ; Northampton does have its class divisions, with those living in the outskirting villages or living in the newer areas of town tend to look down on the more 'established' areas of Northampton and all those who live there.
