fatty confusion
What fat people who try to lose weight get when they can't lose weight. A state of confusion, anger, and self pity. People with this disorder will despise fit people and sometimes even cry at night - some however just don't look into the reasons why they're not losing weight and complain, often giving the excuse 'I have really slow metabolism' or something like that. Fatty confusion is 99% of the time primarily due to lack of knowledge on how to lose weight but in some cases people actually do have very slow metabolism or other disorders which prevent them from having an ordinary or low body fat level.
