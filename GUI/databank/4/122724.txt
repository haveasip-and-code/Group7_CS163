Maleficent
Out of all the [Disney] [Villans], Maleficent is an evil Fairy or known as the wicked bitch of [Hell]. In the cheap Disney adoption of the 1959 animated movie [Sleeping Beauty] she was upset that she didn't get to go to Princess Auroa's birthday day party, so she made a retarded threat saying, when the princess has her 16th Birthday she would die from getting her figure pricked from the spindle of a spinning wheel. ; Like Darth Vader, she had a pretty bad temper and sometimes killed a random number of henchmen. She uses a long rod with a crystal ball on top of it to summon her evil magic. Maleficent also was responsible for kidnapping the Prince Phillip. But later on in the movie the Prince is rescued from the 'three goodie fairies.' Then Maleficent turned herself into a dragon and tried to kill the prince but she died and got stabed by a sword. ; Maleficent is not as evil or bad as any other type of Disney Villains such as [Jafar], [Ursalla], or [Hades]. Other villains just as bad as her that are non Disney are [Darth Vader], [Palpatine], Chief [Blue Meanie], or maybe even [Evillene].
