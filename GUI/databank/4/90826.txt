mommatronification
n. ; A disparaging term used to describe the change in behavior of an old bubble tea-buying Asian lady who suspects her daughter of being a porn star as she develops into a sadistic wench who finds humor in fooling said daughter into thinking that her father was attacked by an assailant in China, killed the assailant with a reversal of kung fu moves, and spent a week in jail under the false accusation of manslaughter.
