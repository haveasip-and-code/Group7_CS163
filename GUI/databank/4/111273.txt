naah
Underestimated by many, naah can be used in a variety of ways. Although easiest to assume that it's slang for 'no,' naah is more of a mocking term. It can be used to make someone's problem seem mediocre, or to brush off a really stupid idea or person, giving you the power to make them feel worthless, which is great. Or you can use naah to make yourself feel better after hearing a stupid singers name... ; and you can put it in words that would normally suck
