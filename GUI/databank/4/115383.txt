2 point slow
Refers to the Volkswagen 2.0 liter, four-cylinder gasoline engine used in VW's North American models. Cars equipped with this powerplant are notoriously sluggish, hence the term '2 point slow'. The term probably derives from the [5 point slow] epithet for certain fox-body Ford Mustangs.
