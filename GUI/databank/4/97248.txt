Electronica
A mostly media-made term for encompassing all forms of electronic music, as individual forms of electronic music aren't popular enough for record stores to devote full sections to. Generally, it will be found next to an equally small 'dance' section that carries the more danceable stuff, while electronica section carries more listening music.
