Terios
A much under-rated 4X4 from Daihatsu. ; Brilliant off-road, capable on-road,the Terios is an engineering marvel. ; The really good new is that the peak power is 24 kW better than the venerable Terios MI V8 at 160 kW, and peak torque is up 20 Nm at 360 Nm. ; 0-60 in just over 6 secs, the 4 cylinder fuel injected engine churns out a whopping 350 bhp, enough raw power to propell the Terios to a top speed of 176mph. ; Only 4X4 purisrts seeking the drive of their life need apply.
