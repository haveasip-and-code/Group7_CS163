bubbla
Pheonetic spelling of [bubbler] as used in the speach of residents of New England, principally Boston. Describes a water fountain. Not the type of fountain that can be found in school hallways and in hospitals, among other places, but the ones which have a 5 gallon tank on top. Name comes from the large bubbles which form and rise to the top of the bottle when the spicket is used.
