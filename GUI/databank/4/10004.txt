cedarville
A private baptist university located near Dayton, Ohio. ; Although located in a remote cornfield, there are over 100 majors to choose from to keep the average student preoccupied in preparing for an exciting post-college career. The average Cedarville student will share that they have placed faith in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. ; In very rare occasions, Cedarville is home to individuals who either 1) flee in anger or 2) graduate in an unwanted field and have no job (see: other definitions of [Cedarville]). Both of these results, however, usually stem from confusion in identity, confusion in defining what 'hard work' is, or worse, confusion in determining what actually is a rich or elitist school (See: [Harvard]).
