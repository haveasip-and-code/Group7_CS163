mellophone
The best god damn instrument ever. Looks like a trumpet but twice its size. I myself can play double high F with Ease now. (not the high F on staff, the high octave over F) The notes are somewhat similar to the Bb Trumpet and it is in the key of F. Most girls who play it however cannot play correctly (not sexist... its just true for the most point.)
