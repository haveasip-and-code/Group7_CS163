drageon
Pronounced 'Dragon with an E,' this despicable, reclusive encrusted creature has no real purpose in its geographical region. It spends its days emitting irritable whines and high-pitched gutteral grunts while it slithers about its cave scratching its scaly breasts. It derives its nourishment from these often lacting breasts caused by advanced gynecomastia. Never engage it in any sort of verbal confrontation for it will do nothing but sit there and stare at you blankly while spewing irrelevant, ignorant and often unfunny sentences. See [hutt]
