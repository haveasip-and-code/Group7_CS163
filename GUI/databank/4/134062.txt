Torah
The word 'Torah' in Hebrew literally means 'to throw, direct, or teach.' While commonly translated as 'Law,' that is not entirely accurate and holds a negative connotation. When Jews speak of the Torah it is generally understood that they speak of the books of Moshe (Moses), the first five books of the Bible. There are others that believe all Scripture to be Torah, as it is God's direction for us.
