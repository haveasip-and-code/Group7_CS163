Windows XP
Fairly decent OS from [Microsoft]. More stable than most Windows versions, but has a number of privacy and end-user-rights issues that are questionable at best. Like all Windows builds, is often blindly flamed by idiots with no clue what an OS is or how it works, thinking MS sucks but not having any ideas how they would do it better. ; Its Fisher-Price looking graphics do however fit in well, considering MS's tech support usually treats you like a toddler.
