Hyde School
A terrible school where the students are looked upon as dirt. Kids spend their free time telling eachtoher what is wrong with their personality. The students parents are brainwashed into thinking its the perfect school. If Hyde had its way, all public schools would be burned to the ground. If you have any concern for your childrens well-being, depression levels, and development, you will have to file a restraining order against yourself so that you will not be allowed within a hundred miles of that hell on earth where children are truly corrupted by adults who have sould that are completley NUMB. Hyde school is a terrible place. We can only pray that educational and child services do the right thing and shut it down. Until then we must pray.
