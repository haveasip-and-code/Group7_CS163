War of the Worlds
1) The name of a science-fiction radio series created by Orson Welles, that was infamous because it made people believe there was an alien invasion happening. ; 2) The name of a movie about aliens trying to invade Earth. ; 3) The name of a movie that will be released in 2005 starring Tom Cruise about aliens who try to take over Earth. ; 4) The name of a series that ran for two seasons in the late 1980's to early 1990's, about a government scientist who finds out aliens have come back to recapture the Earth, and along with a Navajo military colonel named Ironhorse, his computer hacker buddy Norton, and his partner Suzanne, they try to stop the aliens. Went all to hell in the second season when the producers killed off half the cast, (including all the visible minorities!) and added more T&A in order to get more ratings.
