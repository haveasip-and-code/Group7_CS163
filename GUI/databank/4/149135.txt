creezle
(noun) a truly ridiculous person. If you're a creez, you assume no respect. Your shit automatically becomes the property of your friends, as you have no say in these situations. The life of a creez can be hard at times, but you wear the label with pride. You tend to enjoy the intimate company of a certain molly.
