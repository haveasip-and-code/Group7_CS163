Bhangra
A dance that is performed excellently by Punjabi Sikhs. Punjabis have been performing bhangra ever since they had created it themselves. Most parties today are full of punjabi people doing bhangra. The common Hindu person is not really good at doing bhangra, but hey, what can we say, they try.
