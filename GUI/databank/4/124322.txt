old mate
n. Australian colloquialism. A replacement term for a person's name within a sentence. Usage stems from the idea that a person need not be named during a statement or anecdote, but that his or her identity can be deduced by the context of the message. ; Sometimes the identity of old mate may not be discernable from the message's context. Quite often in such instances the identity is immaterial to the underlying message.
