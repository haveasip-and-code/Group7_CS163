perogi
I dunno about perogi being of Chinese origin, in fact I totally dispute it for dispute's sake, but before you get so angry I'll have to find a way to eat you, dumplings are good. ; Um...indeed the definition you gave is true to the nature of perogies, they're dumplings a.k.a. 'stuffed grain-flour pockets' that can be stuffed with anything that can survive frying, baking or boiling. ; Great with [coleslaw].
