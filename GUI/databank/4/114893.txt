Vertex^2
The badass-est song to date on the popular dancing game In The Groove 2 (ITG2). Currently it is locked and only playable on the course Nightmare. On expert, it is a tough 13 footer. There are hands and 'whacked-out' beats throughout the song. Eventually, the song reaches 555bpm with some crazy jump stepping and bullshitting. You'd be lucky to make it through this song alive. ; To sum it all up, Vertex^2 will ruin your shit any day of the week. ; (see 'images' to see what happens when you try to play vertex^2...nubs...)
