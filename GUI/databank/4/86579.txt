bosozoku
Japanese motorcycle gangs. They can be seen wearing pilot jumpsuits and kamikaze headbands driving around roads and highways on souped up motorcycles decorated with battle flags and no mufflers meaning you can hear the full roar of their bike engines. ; Bosozokus mostly consist of teenaged high school drop-outs unlike their western counterparts such as the [Hells Angels]which consist of mostly middle aged war veterans. ; They are not as well known outside of Japan like the [yakuza] but they can be seen a lot in [anime]s such as '[Akira]' and '[GTO]' or films like 'Black Rain'.
