tevas
A garish form of footwear. Often worn by travellers and people with too much money and not enough common sense. Look around...have you ever seen a local wearing 'tevas'? Arrogant and insensitve attempt to cover all the bases. Orignallly the name for a brand specific form of footwear that has since evolved into the generic name describing thongs with velcro straps. Eco-gear for people intent on destroying wildlife.
