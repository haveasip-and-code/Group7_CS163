Poseur
Poseur or as many people say 'poser' is someone who tries to fit into a group of people in an exaggerated way. like a skater poser will wear DC shoes and ride an element deck with spitfire wheels and independent trucks(companies which quite a few non skaters will recognize) and carry it by the truck to school and just stand around holding it not doing anything and will brag about things he probably hasn't ever landed and when asked to do them, he will probably say he doesnt feel like it. ; he will probably rub his shoes against the griptape at home to make it look like hes a hardcore skater and cut the nose with scissors for kickflip marks.
