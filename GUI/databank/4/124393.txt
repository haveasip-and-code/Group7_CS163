Jane and Finch
Jane and Finch is not exactly 'PLAGUED' with violence and crime. It has more crime than some other parts of Toronto, and it's been somewhat worse this summer (2005). But there are so many wonderful, talented, smart, kind, hardworking people who live there, too. I wish people would stop being so down on Jane and Finch, because bad expectations only perpetuate the bad realities.
