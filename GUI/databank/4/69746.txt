s/h/it
On internet message boards and blogs, with growing concern for political correctness, people feel compelled to refer to any unknown or anonymous entity as 'he or she' or 'he/she' etc. ; In response to this, people who have a distaste for political correctness have coined the term s/h/it, pronounced just as it looks. It stands for she/he/it, cleverly taking a disdainable situation and turning it on it's ear.
