Fuchsia
One of the characters in the Gormenghast novels, sister of Titus Groan. In the second book of the trilogy, she kills herself. ; 'Less formidable, yet sullen as her mother and as incalculable, is Titus' sister, Fuchsia. Sensitive as was her father without his intellect, Fuchsia tosses her black flag of hair, bites at her childish underlip, scowls, laughs, broods, is tender, is intemperate, suspicious and credulous all in a day. Her crimson dress inflames grey corridors, or flaring in a sunshaft through high branches makes of the the deep green shadows a greenness darker yet, and a darkness greener.' ; The Cure also wrote a song about how she dies, it's called the drowning man.
