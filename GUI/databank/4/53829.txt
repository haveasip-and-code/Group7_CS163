Dvnbar (Hall)
The coolest girl's dorm on the Exeter campus, or perhaps in the world. All the residents of 'the bar' are extremely cool, talented, hot, brilliant, and superior to you in every way. Being the largest dorm on campus, as well, the Dvnbar girls could easily get their many boytoys to come beat you up if you diss the V.
