fuckin slayer
This is a phenomenon which two or more slayer fans may yell out. ; These 'yellings' occur when a guy goes to/leaves a concert and that guy is so pumped up with adrenaline, so he kinda finds the first guy whom has a slayer tee/hoodie and bellow out 'FUCKIN SLAYER'. The kid whom is yelled to will probably find it shocking the first time, however, he will find a fealing of bonding through this too, because if there are more pumped up fans whom is ready for/been moshing/headbanging is kinda fucked up in the head they will yell too. Like some kind of domino effect.
