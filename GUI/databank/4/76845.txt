threeeee!!!
Linked closely with the [Pantera] DVD of the same name. To pull a threeeee!!! is to place a finger in the earhole and move it around (trying to stop the ringing in one's ears after watching a band play live) and when someone catches you pulling a threeeee!!! the puller removes the finger. The removal takes place on the third moving action in the earhole. The person that caught the other pulling a three then yells Threeeee!!!
