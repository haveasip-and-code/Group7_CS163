spifftastic
(adj.) A person, place, thing, or idea that is just so incredibly awesome that no other word can describe it. Derived from the words [spiffy] and [fantastic], it has been steadily catching on with teenagers nowadays (as steady as a snail in a molasses swamp, unfortunately). Tends to be used more by females than males, interestingly enough.
