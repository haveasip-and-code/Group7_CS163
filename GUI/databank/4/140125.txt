VHORSTMAS
The festival of VHORST, as decreed by the gods of VHORST. Interpreted by the ignorant as 'Christmas', VHORSTMAS is the true festival that occurs in the human marked month of 'December' (known to the gods of VHORST as VHORSTmonth). ; There are no decorations for VHORSTMAS, nor are there any customs aside from making those in YOUR (yes, you) immediate vicinity unhappy in some way. Gifts can be given at VHORSTMAS, but they must be intentionally wrong. Those who follow the gods of VHORST, which is everyone, must spread the word. Everytime the word 'Christmas' is used, a puppy is born just to die. ; The festival of VHORST was identified by a prophet on Habbo Hotel, whom said the word by accident. To the wise, it was obviously more than a typing error - it was destiny.
