mac
shortened for the sub michine gun/auto pistol known as the M11a1, MAC10, and other variations of the weapon. regular magazines carry a capacity of 50 bullets that can be completely emptied in 3.0 seconds. Companies known to best make these weapons are Cobrey and Ingram. pretty gangster weapon in my opinion, also pretty geto. terrorist groups have been known to use them so gangs are obviously not far behind..
