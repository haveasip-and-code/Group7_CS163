uk
A country I live in, which has more accents than Cockney, Mancunian and Upper class idiot, has no county called Devonshire,and actually has a type of football you play with your feet. We also know how to resolve personal issues without guns, lawyers or therapists. We do not have similar accents to Australians, so get it right. A useful piece of information for non-Uk people- Hugh Grant should not be taken as a standard Englishman.
