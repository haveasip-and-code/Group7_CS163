scrabble
A `game` played during a makeout session; originated from a group of friends going to a coffee shop and playing Scrabble for the hell of it. one of the group members referenced making out as a `sexier version of scrabble` (whom shall remain anonymous!) and another member (ANONYMOUS!!) suggested spelling out your name/words with your tongue. This is yet to be experienced with pop rocks... =] hahaha.
