A wine for which you can get the most bang for your buck. College girls love Extra Dry and Brut at 7 dollars a pop. It's perfect for New Years, Greek functions, cheap mimosas, bubbly toasts and when you want to look like an Alkie Stepford Wife. It's fun to share but its even more fun to drink the whole thing yourself.
