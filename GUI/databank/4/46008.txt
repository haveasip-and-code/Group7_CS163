everquest
Something that slowly withdraws you from 'real' life, in which your daily chores become a means to a never ending end - hence the 'ever' in quest. The more you play this game, the more it will strangle you. 'Real' life activities such as waiting for the bus will most likely entail vivid thoughts of what you'd do if you could catch a female dark elf in real life or perhaps weighing up whether or not to buy a mug that makes you more intelligent. Enjoyment does not come from the actual play of the game as it is extremely repetative, rather it comes from the immense sense of power you hold over 'newbies' or those of lower 'level than you - Overall then, quite a decent computer game.
