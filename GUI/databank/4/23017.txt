A undeniably awesome Industrial Metal band. I love Burton Bell's vocals. Sounds very refreshing to most of today's growling and screaming vocals. Their first album sucked but that is pretty much it. They sing about how mankind is obsolete to the machines and how it should be the other way around. They are awesome, yet they have the potential to be so much better. I say this because if they focused just on being pure metal they would be god-like. You may be saying 'that is why they are 'industrial'' But some of their songs incorporate rap(Back the fuck up) and emo(Digimortal). I do not like that I think if they eliminated those two things they could be much better and still be considered Industrial Metal. Don't get me wrong this band is very awesome and I cannot wait to see them live again. I love this band but what I just said I think can make them a lot better.
