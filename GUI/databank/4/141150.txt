Double V
When you make two peace signs/v's with your fingers to signal victory. Several Presidents and individuals have used this as a statement of victory. The first time, however, was by president Wilson, who threw up the double v in front of a bunch of europeans not knowing that it was worse than the middle finger. Another notable use was President Nixon, who committed this act while getting on Marine One to finally leave the White House. The short answer, it does not matter if you are winning or not, you can always throw up the double V.
