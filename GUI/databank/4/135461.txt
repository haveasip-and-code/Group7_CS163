Russian Five
The first all Russian, 5-man skating unit in the history of the National Hockey League. Formed by the Detroit Red Wings in the mid-nineties, the line consisted of Sergei Federov, Slava Kozlov, Igor Larionov, Slava Fetisov, and Vladimir Konstantinov. It was this lineup that helped lead the Detoit Red Wings to win the Stanley Cup in the 1996-97 Season, their first in 42 years. The dominance of the Russian Five came to an abrupt end after the Championship win, with Vladimir Konstantinov suffering career-ending injries in a limousine accident with fellow player Slava Fetisov, and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov.
