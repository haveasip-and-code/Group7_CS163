Secretly Bad Ass
Adjective: When someone is covertly [Bad Ass], i.e. they do not flaunt their badness obnoxiously, but rather KNOW they are bad ass and [crazy] without having to prove it all the time. These people look normal on the outside, but every now and then they 'let loose' and unleash their inner fun, bad ass selves. They can sometimes be menacing, but only upon a closer look.
