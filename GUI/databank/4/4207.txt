Yamachi
'Yamachi' - YamatoxTaichi: Popular Boy's Love (Yaoi) relationship in Digimon. ; Also, 'Yamachi' shows the readers which boy takes on the more 'dominant' role('Seme') and which one takes on the more 'submissive' role ('Uke'), in this case: Yamato - Seme; Taichi - Uke. ; If the roles were reversed, the pairing would not be called 'Yamachi', rather it would be called [Taito].
