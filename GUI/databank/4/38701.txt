sarajevo
A city that was once part of the Austrian-Hungarian Dual Monarchy Empire. The Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was murdered here by a Serbian nationalist in 1914, and is one of major cause of the outbreak of World War I. ; It was also here in the capital of Bosnia that the Serbian people have pushed out the Muslims many decades ago who have been hating them and oppressing them for centuries. Those towelheaded bastards aren't EVER going to be able to gain an official stronghold in Europe, and their definitely not going to have one in this city that produces some really beautiful girls.
