hsom
An acronym meaning \'Hot Song of the Minute.\' Used principally on instant messager to share with friends the song to which one is currently listening. Use of this acronym usually illustrates: 1) a fanatical devotion to music; 2) a proclivity for discussing music socially; 3) very rapidly-changing music tastes; and most of all 4) an attention-span so short that listening to even one\'s favorite song all the way through seems inconceivable. This word originated in an instant messager conversation between Maxim Mayer-Cesiano and Cyrus Habib in the fall of 2004.
