beans on toast
adj. describes something that it is really good, not completely spectacular perhaps, but definitely worth praising. If it's extra special, 'beans on toast with cheese on top' is also appropriate. ; As an aside, I'd like to take issue with 'anonymous' who has also posted a definition of 'beans on toast'. ; Firstly, is this website a recipe board of some sort? Don't the definitions have to have an alternative or slang meaning? Will we be seeing 'cheeseburger, a beef patty between two halves of a sesame seed bun' on here next? ; Secondly, not even the British consider beans on toast a delicacy. It's a quick and easy snack, that's all. ; Thirdly, 'why do you need the toast?' Why not have toast? Do you only ever eat one food group at a time? Are you saying you'd eat spaghetti bolognese without the spaghetti? Or is this some sort of Atkins diet concern you have? ; Aaaand relax...
