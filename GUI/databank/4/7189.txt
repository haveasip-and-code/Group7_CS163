Afro Chicken
This is the 'street name' for a strange old wifie who occasionally pops up in Charleston Academy to teach the poor class left without a teacher. ; Nobody actually knows her real name, or even if she has one, but one thing is known (well, two) - she looks like a chicken, and she has an afro! ; She doesn't like the film Little Nicky.
