Broadneck
A decent sized bed-town to [Annapolis] (Maryland's capital). Although all Broadneck residents have an Annapolis address, they know that the Broadneck Peninsula (aka 'The Peninsula')is unique and is not like Annapolis. It's small...but it's not Annapolis and it's most definitely not Severna Park...otherwise they wouldn't get their own high school. As far as the high school goes...Broadneck is known for it's high achievements in all fields, music, athletics, and academics. And there's always an ongoing rivalry between Severna Park and Broadneck. Broadneck is home to Sandy Point and the 3 mile long Bay Bridge. All Broadneck kids know that Sandy Point isn't exactly the best place to swim...the water is NOT ideal, but the beach is a great place for laying out and playing frisbee. Broadneck revolves around one main road called College Parkway, which contains the Anne Arundel Community College, but technically, that end is Arnold (Broadneck wannabees). Broadneck also contain O'Laughins, a hot wing hot spot. And then there's 'The Cape'...a neighborhood where they put all the people that are absolutely dying to live on the peninsula, or to have their children attend Broadneck, or whatever...bottom line is, house on Broadneck are very expensive, and so, the Cape was built...where THOUSANDS of little houses with no yards were placed...if you don't live in the Cape, I advise you not to go there...you won't come out...
