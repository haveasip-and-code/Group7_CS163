white metal
A style that seems to be coming up everywhere. Christian metal. As was said earlier, you don't exactly have to be like black metal, and it is NOT faggot music (think.. Christianity, homosexuals?). It used to be kind of rare to see a Christian metal band (because it was always thought of as oxymoron), but lately it has been coming up everywhere.
