Dropkick
People who've dropped out of school, and become a drug addict or look like a homeless person. ; Those teenage boys you see hooning down your street every night on BMX bikes, swearing and trashing stuff cause they have nothing better to do with their miserable lives. ; Those [derros] that hang outside Bi-Lo all day, smoking stuff, thinking they look cool.
