Euroslut
Non-Europeans who continually speak of the greatness of Europe and all that is European, despite living nowhere near Europe or hailing from a European country. Eurosluts commonly enjoy spending time taking long walks through any European city in springtime, drinking wine or spirits over long lunches, and paying exorbitant amounts of money for gas, or, petrol if you will. They have the ability to work Europe into any conversation on any topic. Though a fairly common trait amongst them but not widely know by non-Eurosluts, they also have a penchant for buggery.
