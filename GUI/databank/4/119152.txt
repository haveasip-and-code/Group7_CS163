Comic-con
The world's largest and most kickass annual 4-day nerd fest in sunny San Diego, California featuring comic books, games, arts, movies, and various pop culture. This is where you'll find the coolest and the hottest actors/actresses as well as the biggest dorks and geeks in the world under one roof. You will occasionally see some hotties in slutty costumes as well.
