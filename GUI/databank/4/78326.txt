Sponge
A word secretly used to refer to [black people]. It is used so white people can openly talk about blacks in public with out being stabbed or shot (see '[reverse racism]' and '[reggin]'). The origin of 'sponge' comes from the generalization that several black people have afros, and would thus be able to absorb water like a sponge.
