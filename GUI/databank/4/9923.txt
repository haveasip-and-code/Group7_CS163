governator
Arnold Schwazenegger is....half man, half governor. ; He proves to be an unbeatable candidate. How does he prove this? By blasting the liberal left and get away with it! Even George W. Bush wouldn't be able to do that! ; Only one man can make a remark that offends homosexuals and get away with it... ; Only one man can have a history of sexual harassment and have women at his rallies holding up signs that says 'you can harass me any day!'... ; Only one man can motivate people to vote in something other than the presidential election... ; The Governator!
