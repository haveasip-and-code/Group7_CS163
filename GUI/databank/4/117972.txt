social security
A pretty bad deal, expect less than a 1% return on your 12.4% payroll tax. Also, reduces the ability and incentive to save for retirement. Involves no creation of wealth, and the Supreme Court ruled that you have no right to social security funds, thus your benefits are highly politized. Maybe its time to start thinking about taking care of ourselves...
