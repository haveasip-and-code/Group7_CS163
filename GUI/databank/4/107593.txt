port-o-potty
One of the best features of any construction site. They are mainly used as a portable restroom for workers, but after dark they have alot more uses. One can run up to them and tip them over in an activity called [port-o-tipping]. Fireworks can be lit inside of them, in hopes that it won't catch fire, and they can also be ridden down large grassy hills. They usually smell like shit and are crawling with disease.
