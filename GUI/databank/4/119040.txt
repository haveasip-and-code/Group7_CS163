preppy douche bag
The preppiest of the prep-schoolers, usually male, who makes a habit of dressing like he/she is straight out of a Ralph Lauren catalogue. Not Abercrombie, not American Eagle, not Hollister, and never ever ever Aeropostale. Ralph Lauren. Usually idendtified by the double pastel Polos, one often pink, the other green or yellow, both collars popped. Also note the ribbon belt and Nantucket red pants. They do not go to public school and will always have more money than you. See also [preppy].
