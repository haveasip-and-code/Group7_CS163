Nintendo Revolution
Nintendo's 2006 console that will focus on gameplay first and graphics second, though will probably excell at both. This is contrary to the PS3 and XBox 360, which will only have graphics as a selling point, lacking gameplay. Also offers the ability to download classic games from previous Nintendo systems.
