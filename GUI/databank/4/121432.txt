Supreme Team
A drug gang based out of South Jamaica, Queens in NYC. Allegedly half-a-dolla, a.k.a. 50 cent, was a low level crack dealer with the gang who never made it big. Also, it's believed that the former, or still might be leader via prison, Kenneth 'Supreme' McGriff was behind the death of 1/2-a-dolla's mother and conspired to kill 50 Cent, which resulted in 9 alleged bullet holes and a record contract.
