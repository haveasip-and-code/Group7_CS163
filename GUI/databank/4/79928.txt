C.S. Lewis
'Tis my SUPREME HONOR to be the first to write a definition...er, brief biography...of C.S. Lewis on urbandictionary. ; Clive Staples Lewis (1898 - 1963) - Better known as 'Jack' Lewis by his circle of friends the Inklings (which included J.R.R. Tolkien, among others) and his family, C.S. Lewis was described by those who knew him best as 'a man in love with the imagination'. Fellow and Tutor in English at Magdalen College, Oxford University (1925-1954) and later Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University (1954-1963), Lewis devoted his life to being influential on the world through his intellectual/literary pursuits. He authored the prolific Chronicles of Narnia children's fantasy series, The Space Trilogy(a science fiction series), Till We Have Faces(a modern telling of the Psyche myth), theology-based fictions such as The Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce, and The Pilgrim's Regress, and now time-honored works on Christian reflection such as Mere Christianity, The Abolition of Man, The Problem of Pain, Miracles, The Four Loves, Reflections on the Psalms, and A Grief Observed. Though he considered himself 'only a layman' of the Anglican Church, Lewis wrote with the theological know-how and incisive wit of a man with years of seminary education. Though he passed away on the same day as President Kennedy and is now asleep in the Lord, every year Lewis continues to deeply influence millions who discover the joy of reading his works for the first time.
