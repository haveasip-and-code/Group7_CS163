An ancient drug the Native Americans took, think of it as a 'druggy's soup'. What it is, is a mixture of substances that are combined with certain drugs and foods, which is placed into it's other half- it's liquid mix. YOu take it just as you would drink/eat soup. It obviously gives you that high feeling and hallucinations. ; Wanna know how to make it? ; 1. Get a pot and fill with water. Squeeze ONE lime and THREE tangerines into the water. (their juices) ; 2. Grind up raw UNCAFFINATED coffee beans. It doesnt matter what kind as long is its caffinated. If you'd rather eat them whole, just drop them into the soup.. ; 3. Put leaves from marijuana into it and put dried shrooms into it containing psilocybin. ; 4. When finish putting everything in, BOIL IT on the stove. ; EAT UP! n dont forget to drink it to.
