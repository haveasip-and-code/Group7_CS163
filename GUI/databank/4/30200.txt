JDW
JDW is a 'hood' if you will. It is located outside of [Doylestown]. It is quite possibly the hardest hood in Central Bucks School District. It is not unlikely that if you are driving through JDW you will see a drive-by or a stabbing. In JDW everybody sleeps below the windows so they will not get hit by a stray. There are approximately 65 houses located in this hood. Although you will see plenty of BMWs and Mercedes, you will also see plenty of white tees, and weed smolking hoodlums. It is a good idea to stay away from these kids, because if you are hostile towards one of them, their whole crew will be on you like white on rice.
