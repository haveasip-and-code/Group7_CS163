Namibia
Crazy country bordering South Africa. Interesting facts: this country is larger than the state of Texas (Texas has more cattle), but smaller than the state of Alaska. Most common name in Namibia is Gunther, pronounced Goon-tee-r. Exotic game hunting is a large part of the economy here. They enjoy 'up-dog' when visiting the US.
