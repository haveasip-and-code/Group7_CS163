Terror Cookie
A Terror Cookie is a teen, aged 14-17 who hangs out at the local mall food court. The wear shitty makeup, such as the 'crying eyeliner,' 'the evil eyeliner spider web' and the ever classic 'the crow's awesome makeup'. They hang out in food courts because they like to 'scare old ladies' and 'annoy the preppies' but really, they are looking for attention. They are nothing more than attention whores, not unlike the little camwhores that litter this website. Terror Cookies wear clothes (usually hoodies) that feature such amazing artists as KoRn, Slipknot, Marilyn Manson and Cradle Of Filth. They (the terror cookies) feel the need to be 'different' by copying the styles of Dani Filth, Brian Warner (Marilyn Manson) and other famous rock stars. Terror Cookies are also 'depressed' and 'suicidal' because thats what they feel the goth lifestyle is all about. They are also uneducated but come from a middle class family in the suburbs, because, living in the suburbs is so evil and vile that it spawns Terror Cookies... its just that evil
