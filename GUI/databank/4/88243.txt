neighbor
People who live adjacent to you. ; They may live next door, down the road, on the other side of the wall, on top of you, or below you. ; They can be nice, rude, outgoing, shy, or cool. They may bake plates of browines or cookies for you. They may have sex a lot. They may blast shitty music at unreasonable hours. You may hang out with them a lot. You may never see them. ; Weather you love them or hate them, you had better learn to live with them, because they live so close to you, after all.
