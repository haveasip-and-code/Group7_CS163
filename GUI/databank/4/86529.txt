smonday
The magical day before Monday and after Sunday. The perfect day to plan to do things you can't really afford the time to do during the week. Alternatively, anything you can't remember when or if it happened, say it happened on Smonday. ; Originated from some confusion when a weekly TV guide missed the date between a Sunday and a Monday, leaving the only explanation that the missing date fell on a Smonday.
