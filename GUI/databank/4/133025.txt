otters
a little kiddy game me and my cousin used to play whenever i went over to her house and we went to the neighborhood pool to swim. its when you pretend that your an otter, and you take a rock and sorta scrape at the bottom of the pool, supposedly digging up clams. also see [sharks and minnows].
