Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Okay, now many of you may be thinking,'It was a horrible remake! I hate it!' In all honesty, it was (is) a GREAT movie and NOT a remake! Johnny Depp plays a charming, quirky, Willy Wonka, who is not based on Michael Jackson or Marilyn Manson (as Depp has said many times in several interveiws.) Freddie Highmore is (in my opinion, as everything is) the best Charlie Bucket! Any other actorwould have been a drastic mistake! I thought that the add-ons were very nice, they all lead up to the perfect endding which left you feeling happy and warm. If you ask me, theres no such thing as a bad Tim Burton movie (I didn't like Pee-wee that much, but I loved it as a little child.) The whole cast seemed to just feel right, and if your anyhthing like me, your still humming the Willy Wonka theme-song!
