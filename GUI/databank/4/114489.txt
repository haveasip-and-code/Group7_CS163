pseudo-boyfriend
Much like a friend with benefits except the benefits go beyond the sexual sphere. The boy becomes attached and wants both emotional and sexual support from you without any committment. If someone asks, much like friends with benefits, you are not together, just friends. You know, friends who call each other just to say good night, friends who invite each other for holidays, friends who sleepover once a week, friends who have sex and do all other things sexual yet listen to sappy songs in the dark, etc. etc. Really for all intents and purposes you are a couple, but refuse to admit it and pretend everyone else doesn't know it.
