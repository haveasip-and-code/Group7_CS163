Video Toaster ; A powerful Hardware card/device that works alongside with the Software [LightWave] 3D that is used for Video Editing and [CGI] effects mainly utilized by the Movie/TV industry. It is a multi functional tool and used for video switching, genlocking, chroma-keying, luma-keying, character generation, animation, and image manipulation. ; The whole market was shaken by the introduction of these devices in 1990 for [Amiga] a true underdog and ahead of its time affordable computer. The ability to produce lower cost special video effects moved the business and similar products were also launched by NewTek the manufacturer of VT for Macintosh and IBM compatible PCs in 1995. Neither platform actually succeeded till the collapse of [Commodore] the manufacturer of Amiga. And even after the fall, for many years the industry treated the other two platforms as less successfull copycats. Only recently the other two gained the market, but Amiga is still used today as a turnkey system for development, the end result is later migrated to PC/Macintosh for use in todays architecture. ; There was an old saying that never reallly died among the guru meditating Amiga and VT users: ; PC want it, Macintosh watch it, Amiga has it! ; That is the bottom line.
