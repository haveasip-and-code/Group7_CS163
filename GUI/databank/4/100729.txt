ddeod
Dark Dude Eating Oriental Delights. ; This acronym was on the very funny show Reno 911! on Comedy Central. The episode in question was the homeland security episode in which African American officer Jonesy and an attractive Asian Homeland Security officer are riding in the car. She is quizzing him and asks him what DDEOD stands for to which he replied the above. Needless to say she was not impressed.
