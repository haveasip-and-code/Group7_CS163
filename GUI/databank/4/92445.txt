small gray alien
'Small Gray' is the common name given to the most common of the beings that are thought of as an 'alien,' or [extraterrestrial] (not from earth). When someone draws a picture of an alien, it is often a small gray. ; The words 'small gray' are descriptive of how the beings look. Small grays are gray in color, believed to be about 3 feet tall, and although their heights vary, none are as large as human beings. They look similar to human beings: head, trunk, two arms and two legs, hands with fingers (the number of fingers I don't know). ; The head is hairless, the face is a roundish egg shape (point down). Eyes are large and oversized for the face, almond shaped, all black, not having a white or pupil or eyelid. The mouth is small, no lips, teeth are usually not drawn. Their body is almost child like: small, thin, hairless, with no distinct muscle development (the opposite of a weight lifter), or evidence of gender. Small Gray's are usually drawn as having no clothing or body covering. ; Just like humans look alike but look different, there are aliens that differ slightly from small grays. Some are different in color, pale gray or dark gray or brown, and they have been named by people who can tell them apart. I am not familiar with those names or what the differences are, they all look the same to me :). ; Small Grays are the aliens often described by people who say that they have been abducted by aliens. ; I am not an expert on this subject. I was looking for some of the other names for small grays, and this dictionary had none at all, so I thought I'd leave something for the next person.
