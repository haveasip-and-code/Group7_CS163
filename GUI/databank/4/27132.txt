GG Rutz
A phrase that is commonly used in a belitting fashion. The phrase was coined in response to a certain kid, [Rutzman], who habitually does retarded things. The 'GG' is said to bring shame to a certain person, however, when adding the 'Rutz' after, the phrase multiplies its disparaging connotation.
