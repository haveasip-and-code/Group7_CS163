Crazy Irish Wankers
Crazy Irish people who get pissed off when people forget about St.Pattie's Day. And when that wonderful day comes, they dress in all green, shouting 'Happy bleeping St.Patrick's Day you stoopid mofo gits' at people who give them strange looks. They also like to get piss drunk on Ginger Ale.
