un-BG
On the [Aridor] Slave Rescue game, to un-BG a character is the opposite of to [BG] a character. It means, getting rid of the bodyguards assigned to a character, so they can be captured by ordinary means. It is used to refer both to situations where a player deliberately gets rid of the bodyguards on their own character (by losing a contest for instance), and where a player [rumble]s or [biobomb]s another in order to get rid of BGs.
