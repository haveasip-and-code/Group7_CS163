middle school
a shitwhole where everyone either thinks they are the best thing since sliced bread or become suicidal. supposedly everyone is 'equal', but in their head everyone is thinking they are better than everyone else. friendships are shallow, limited only to the people in your classes or cliques. everyone in the fucking building has stress and anxiety issues....yet they still think they are different.
