Killer Instinct
A fighting game that was developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. It was debuted in the arcades and received AWESOME reviews; the game included graphics unlike any seen before, and a cool fighting system based on combos. The first KI game was released at around November of '94. ; Rare & Nintendo released its sequel in 1996. The graphics were downgraded, among other things, but the infamous combo system was boosted to make it all the more entertaining. ; The first KI was originally going to be released for the [Ultra 64], but instead it was released for the Super Nintendo on August 30th, 1995. The reviews of that game were decent; the game wasn't much of an arcade replica but all the gameplay elements managed to get fit in. Killer Instinct 2 was released for the [Nintendo 64], under the title 'Killer Instinct Gold'. It had some slight downgrades but once again all the gameplay elements were fit in.
