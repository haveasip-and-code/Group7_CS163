jammno
A total creepy fuck, whose ideas on love and relationships border on psychotic at best. His teeth are rotted stumps, he has never touched a girl, and his idea of a fancy restaurant is one where you spend $12 dollars. He posted of a World of Warcraft board asking for advice on how to get a girlfriend in exchange for WoW money. ; '1k gold? You got it. 2k? Sure. 3k? I'll farm days on end until I can pay you. Want real life money? No problem.' ; His only requirement for a girlfriend is that they cut off all contact with friends and family, because doing otherwise would not be showing total devotion to him. This includes business and professional relationships with the opposite sex, as evidenced by his stating that he would leave his World of Warcraft guild when he gets a girlfriend, because talking to the female members ingame would constitute cheating. ; Jammno also believes that to date someone is to show them love, and to date someone without loving them utterly is 'cheater's talk'.
