splib
Probably Chicago in origin, an extremely derogatory term referring to blacks, such as the black group that beat and robbed your brother on a public bus. In groups they tend to compete with each other in violence against white folk, always one cracker at a time. The lone splib tries to rape your mother alone at a CTA bus stop. Splibs, however, usually are informal and not at all gang organized, as the gangs have much more discipline, purpose, and leadership. When in splib mode, a splib never turns on another splib, but only whitey. Splib groups gel spontaneously and quickly disband after a bit of violent anarchy. It is impossible to come up with a more derogatory word. Somalia is civilized compared to the splibs.
