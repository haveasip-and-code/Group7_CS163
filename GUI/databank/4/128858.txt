703
The area code for the real [Northern Virginia]. Basically, just another way of saying you're from there. It covers Arlington, Fairfax, Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, and parts of Fauquier, Eastern Loudoun, and Prince William. Landwise, 703 covers the smallest area land-wise in Virginia but it's so crowded that they had to add a new area code for unfortunate cellphone users (571). Way back when this was the area code for all of Virginia but slowly they had to add more area codes. Northern Virginia has a reputation for being very wealthy but as you get further out from DC you'll notice that we have are share of rednecks just like the rest of VA (they are just different kinds of rednecks). We also have lots of wiggers and gangstaz! 703 is the shit- where da boyz is fine and da women is fresh.
