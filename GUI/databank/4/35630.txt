liquid tension experiment
A project beginning origionally as a solo-album for Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy and gradually growing to be a collective project of soon-to-be Dream Theater Keyboardist Jordan Rudess (who was accepted to Juliard at the age of 9), Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucci, and bass guitarist Tony Levin (former King Crimson, Pink Floyd, and Paul Simon band member). ; Both albums were completed in a week and were entirely improvised.
