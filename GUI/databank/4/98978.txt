Died from a heart attack March 13th 1998 after a concert in a pub in Canterbury, England at the age of 53. ; Renowned for his beer belly and dirty lyrics described as, 'as subtle as a smack in the ear with a housebrick'. ; After [Bob Marley & the Wailers] he is the second best selling reggae artist in the history of the British charts. ; Also, he was the first white reggae artist to have a hit and perform in Jamaica. The jamaicans did not know this though when Dread entered the stage, but when looking at the numbers of sold records on the island, he did not disappoint them. ; Known for his Big-hits ('Big One', 'Big Six', 'Big Nine' et. c.)and his tribute to the golden days of the skinhead culture in 'Last of the Skinheads'. Dread also sang covers of classic ska hits like Phoenix City, Skinhead Moonstomp and Rudy, A Message to You. ; For more info about Judge Dread, check out: http://www.tic.de/mkrauel/dread.htm ; Picture of Judge Dread: http://www.conne-island.de/nf/31/9c.jpg
