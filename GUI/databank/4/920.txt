Moog
Literal: A keyboard from 60's and 70's that can only play one note at a time. ; Modern Meaning: A general moderate to severe put-down, see asshole, shithead, etc. ; Backround: One morning on the bus to school, my buddy and I decided to use the name of the old-school Moog keyboard as an insult.
