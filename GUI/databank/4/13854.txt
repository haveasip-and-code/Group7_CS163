agnes irwin
Definition of an Agnes Irwin girl: Wearing cashmere sweaters, Gucci sunglasses, and Tiffanys galore, these Philadelphian socialits take pride in their top notch prepatory education, the Agnes Irwin School. Arriving in BMWs, Audis, or Land Rovers, these blondes (if not outwardly, then at least at heart) not only know how to calculate daddy's trust fund, but also their 1300> SAT score. Special skills include superior hair flipping, being tan all year round, and looking sexy in a white buttondown shirt, collar up. When not applying to the top universities in the country, these AIS ladies may be spotted at parties with an Ivy League bound hunk, while taking shots of expensive liquor from their families wine cellars. Ultimately defined as one of beauty, wealth, and brains, an AIS girl will carry on the tradition of charming you with her classy styles and grace.
