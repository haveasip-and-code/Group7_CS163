east coast
The best part of the U.S. Innovators in music ([jazz], [punk], [hip-hop]), architecture (see [New York] and [Chicago] for more info), [culture] (Metropolitan [Opera], [Boston] Symphony Orchestra, CBGB) and more). Birthplace of the American movie industry (headquartered in New York and Chicago before it decamped for LA). Hated and envied by the inferior [West Coast], which doesn't have an original idea to its fake-tanned anorexic bitch-ass du-ragged empty head.
