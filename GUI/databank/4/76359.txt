Bunnyman
A mascot spreading across universities all over the United States in a 'Killroy Was Here' style movement. Posters, stickers, and chalkboard drawings including the phrase 'Bunnyman Demands Servitude' or 'Surrender, Bunnyman Demands it' and a small modernist design bunny emblem are the normal mediums.
