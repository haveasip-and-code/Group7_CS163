'Intelligent Dance Music', an often debated term for a style of electronic music (as 'intelligent' sounds pretentious and it's not really 'dance music') that encompasses a confusingly wide area of music. Mostly enjoyed by computer nerds and LSD-heads, mostly a combination of both. Known for being more cerebral than many forms of music, thus 'intelligent'. Listeners of this form of music are generally stereotyped as pretentious musical afficionado pricks.
