Kevin Trudeau
Kevin Trudeau is the infomercial overlord (Yeah Ron Popeil has been around longer but Kevin has [owned] so many more people!). Kevin has been on the air for more than a decade selling products such as Mega Memory, the notorious Coral Calcium & biotape and most recently a book titled 'Natural cures they don't want you to know about', just to name a few. Kevin Trudeau has also gotten himself in trouble with the FTC for making faulty claims in his infomercials. For more information look him up on the net, there is a lot more out there about him now than there was not too long ago.
