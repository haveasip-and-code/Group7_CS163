emo screamo
Emo music attempting to be 'hard'. It usually involves a band that tries to sing about their feelings, but usually, because they aren't very talented at singing, they attempt to scream their feelings. Lyrics to the words are unintelligable, and singing along usually causes one to lose their voice. ; Band members of emo screamo are typically seen wearing skin tight girl pants, cut off t-shirts, make-up (in a feminine way) and almost always have their bangs swooped in a diaganonal pattern across their face in either direction. I believe they are attempt to distract the concert-goers from actually listening to them.
