williamsburg
A neighborhood in Brooklyn. A gentrification hotspot. Mostly made up of Jews, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, other hispanics, and a hint of Italians and Poles near the northern tip. Was considered THE robbery hotspot during the 80's. Now you see condos arising and pinker/whiter flesh arriving. From rednecks to Afrikaners.
