jamestown
a small island in southern rhode island where it seems as if all the other people in the state visit in order to experience psychadelic drugs. in jamestown you can find nothing but punks and hippies and the occasional black wannabe. jamestown is a place where skateboarding is more popular than football and the mushrooms are never prtabello... always mind enhancing. most parents will not let their children come to jamestown because if he does, within weeks of his first encounter with this magical region, he will be 'one with earth.' he will be rolling his own cigarettes and talking in nothing but street drug slang. but the most important thing of all is we jamestowners love our mother nature.
