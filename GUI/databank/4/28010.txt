jays
Jays is the word to replace 'jokes' with. People say 'hey that guy is jokes' and being to sound like homosexuals. Jays in short form-j's was derived in ancient mythological time and is now being brought back beyond popular demand. It can be altered into many forms. Such as PFJ's=PURE F***ing Jays...or jaysons...this word is so versitile...so sleek...while still maintains that sense of class we need in our english laguage today.
