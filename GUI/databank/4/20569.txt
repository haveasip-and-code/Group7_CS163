MN Junkies
The rowdiest bunch of high school sports fans ever! MN is short for Middletown North, which is in Middletown, NJ. The Junkies go to all North games, especially the ice hockey and soccer games. Also, the Junkies chant throughout the whole game, which pisses off the other fans and the other team. Our signature chant is when the other team gets scored on, we chant 'You're beat!'
