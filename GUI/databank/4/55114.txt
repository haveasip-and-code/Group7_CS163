Whadda ya need help for?
Invented by [Jeff Mcrae] (see: Jeff Mcrae), 'Whadda ya need help for?' is the ultimate act of humor in a computer class/lab. While someone works on a computer, reach over and press the F1 key (or other Help File hot key) to open the program's help menu, while saying 'Whadda ya need help for?' in a sarcastic manner. ; Also, there is a delayed 'Whadda ya need help for?' This is done when the user is away from the computer and F1 is pressed. When the user gets back, often moving the mouse out from a screen saver, the Help File/Menu is open, and the 'Jeff Mcrae' says 'Whadda ya need help for?' ; 'Whadda ya need help for?' is often used in conjunction with [zing]s.
