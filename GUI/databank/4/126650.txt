Deconstruction
Band formed after the first fall-apart of Jane's Addiction. Dave Navarro and Eric Avery formed it. Stephen Perkins was interested but instead, he joined Perry Farrell's project, Porno For Pyros. They had one album: Deconstruction. They had one video: L.A. Song. They had no tour. A one time project that turned out surprisingly well. Dave and Eric's band name comes from their rebelling from Jane's Addiction.
