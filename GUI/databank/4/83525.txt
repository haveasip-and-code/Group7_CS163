Ford Falcon
The rival to the Australian Holden [commodore] ; Australian sedan ranging from family car up to the sports and luxury models ; Seen as a more luxuourious option over the Holden Commodore, many are used as Limousines ; While it battles for domination over the Commodore, many would argue it comes off second best as the Holden Commodore holds the most wins in the Bathurst Motor Race, and usually holds higher sales figures and for the sport fans the Commodore has the better look and feel of a sports car ; Is the cause of many dinner table arguments as the Holden vs Ford debate is seen as a bit of a religious following in Australia as you are either a Holden Man or a Ford Man
