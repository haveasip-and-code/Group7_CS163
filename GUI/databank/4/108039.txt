canterbury
Canterbury is a college prep school in New Milford Connecticut. While many students attend Canterbury, the majority are either day students of boarders that decide to pay the extra money to live there even though they live five minutes away. The students at Canterbury attend the school (regardless of what they say) because 1) their parents have way too much money 2) They are retarded. ; Canterbury is good in hockey and football. And that is about it. Athletically and academically.
