pishy
Female working class trash, native of Belfast. While usually dormant in daylight hours, pishies can be spotted wearing pyjama's, slippers, pushing a pram with a lit cigarette (feg) in mouth on way to local spar/centra to buy more 'fegs' and the [wean](Caprice or Jordan) a tin of baked beans with sausages for lunch. Orange faces, giant hoop earings and high ponytails are also pishy essentials. Nocturnal activities generally evolve around alcohol (Blue WKD is the pishies choice) and getting pumped by the male of the species the [spide]. ; See also [milly], [millbag].
