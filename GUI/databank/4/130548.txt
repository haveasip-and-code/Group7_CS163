punk rockers
kids who believe that they are unique and special and have a great taste in music. Mostly young adults (14-19) who think that anything that is commerciallized is bad. If their music is put on a radio or a TV channel it is sold out. These people are all about appearance and are the biggest pretenders ever...they claim they don't care what people think about them, but they are just lying because they are huge gayasses.
