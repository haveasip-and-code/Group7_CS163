LOVE
w h a t ` s L O V E ? ; are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing? and is your voice caught within your chest? ; it isn`t love, its like. ; you can`t keep your eyes or hands off them, am i right? ; it isn`t love, it`s lust. ; are you proud and eager to show them off? ; it isn`t love, its luck. ; do you want them because you know they`re there? ; it isn`t love, its loneliness. ; are you there just cuz its what everyone wants? ; it isn`t love, its loyalty. ; Do you stay for their confessions of love, because you don`t wanna hurt them? ; it isn`t love, its pity. ; are you willing to give all of your favorite things for their sake? ; it isn`t love, its charity. ; are you there because they kissed you, or held your hand? ; it isn`t love, its unconfident. ; do you pardon their faults because you care about them? ; it isn`t love, its friendship. ; do you tell them everyday they are the only one you think of? ; it isn`t love, its a lie. ; But do you except there faults because they`re a part of who you are? Do you see their true heart, and touch your soul so deeply it hurts? Are you attracted to others, but stay with them faithfully without regret? Would you give them your heart, your life, your death and stay because a blinding in comprehensible mix of pain and elation pulls you close and holds you? now thats LOVE...
