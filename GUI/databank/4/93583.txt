New Wave
Watered down punk rock. It was started by CBGB bands Television, Talking Heads and Blondie. Although these bands were originally known as punk, they were renamed new wave because they didn't share punk's negative image and were more experimental. Eventually new wave evolved into a bunch of bullcrap like The Romantics.
