A home-centered education run by a child's parents, rather than by the government. The parents pay taxes to the government to pay for [public school], and they pay far more for books and other materials to educate their own children. ; Home-school children learn reading, writing, and arithmetic. They learn correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. They learn real science and real political science. They do NOT learn politically correct ideas, socialist ideas, or faggoty ideas, all of which are taught to kids in public school. ; Home-schooled children tend to score higher on national tests. They are enculturated just as easily as public school children. ; In class, home-schooled children are not interupted by young [Pachuco] children or other disruptive junior hoodlums. They learn independent thinking, and are never lifelong slaves to groupthink and the group mentality foisted on other children by public schools.
