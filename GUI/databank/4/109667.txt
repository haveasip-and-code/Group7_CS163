*Napolean Dynamite
Is about a teenager who isn't so dynamite in his universe. But in the real world he's the funniest loser ever. One could categorize this with some of the best teen movies ever (16 candles, The Breakfast Club, etc.) ; The movie has no set time. The time is Peluca, Idaho. It's a movie about a teen going through obstacles and going through more obstacles, which become the funniest PG movie I've seen. ; *Wait until after the credits, for a funny scene
