confrontee
the person presumed to be severely inebriated (stoned, drunk, hallucinating) that is pursued by the 'Confrontation Method' of the Pittsburgh Parents Against Stoners; the PPAS made a conscientious choice to make the term mimic 'abductee' to suggest that their technique will remove the inebriated person from the pleasantness of their experience
