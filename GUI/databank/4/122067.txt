applestamp
An applestamp is what happens when someone is such an idiot that they do something with their Apple notebook, such as: ; -Change their login name and forget what they changed it to. ; -Bake their powerbook at 450 for 10 minutes ; To perform an applestamp, close said notebook, raise it to a proper angle, and strike the offending user on the side of the face or about the head in any manner you deem appropriate. ; The result, if done properly, will be the apple logo on the dolt's cheek. There for always, to remind them that yes, they are one of the .04% of people that are too stupid to use a mac.
