plumber
One who fixes or repairs pipes. Plumber has a 'b' in it because pipes were originally made of lead, (lead seemed a logical choice at the time, because of its resiliancy against rust... then people discovered what lead poisening was, and rust no longer seemed so bad!) and lead's abbreviation on the [periodic table] is pb (derived from its latin name).
