wiggley
Wiggley is a small worm thingy that comes in many colours. Contrary to popular belief he is not a worm. He is infact, a piece of see-through string with fur and eyes. ; Because the string is see-through, it looks like Wiggley is flying! :O ; Wiggleys have been available for years, but are now sold by that bloody annoying company JML that sells crap like 2-sided ironing boards and bras for people with saggy breasts. Bastards.
