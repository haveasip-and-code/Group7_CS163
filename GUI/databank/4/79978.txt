Limecat
Destroyer of Clockspider and his evil followers. Limecat is the one true god, the god of all. If you defy Limecat, he is known to give you the Frown of Doom which leads to decomposition of the penis. Limecat may also give you the Glare of Justice, which he was known to give to Clockspider before biting off his ninth leg. All hail Limecat, king of the universe, king of cats everywhere. He also uses pedigree.
