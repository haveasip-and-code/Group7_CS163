E.V.O.O.
Extra Virgin Olive Oil, the stuff Rachel Ray uses to cook with, dress salads with, and, I should hope, roll around with her buddies in after a hard week slaving over a hot stove. The usage seems to be spilling over to other cooking shows as well, but caution: no matter what Rachel tells you, if you are cooking, E.V.O.O. is a waste; save it for salads and use more ordinary oil at the stove. For rolling around in, I should think you could do just as well with Mazola.
