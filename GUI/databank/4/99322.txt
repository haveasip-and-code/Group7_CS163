Go tensile test yourself
Engineer's [euphemism] of 'Go f--- yourself'. ; A tensile test is where make a special specimen of whatever material you want to test, and you put it in a tensile testing machine. The machine slowly strains (elongates) the specimen and measures how the specimen responds, ie how much force it goes under. The machine makes a graph of the stress-strain behavior, where stress is force divided by the cross-section area of the specimen. ; This is the very finest way to tell an engineer to [get lost].
