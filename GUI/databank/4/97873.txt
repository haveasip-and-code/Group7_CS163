lawl
This word is basically the pronounciation of the AOL instant messanger slang 'lol' which means 'laugh out loud' but it is much more than that. ; ' ; Popularized by PurePwnage's very own Jeremy (the pwnerer), people now use the word 'lawl' in every day speech. The more a's in the word, the funnier it is.
