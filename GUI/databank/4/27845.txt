The Fork Of Justice
Originally an amusing and unique handle for chat rooms and games (originally MINE that is) which has become a comical (and increasingly widespread) way to 'poke' fun at evildoers, [trolls] or any one of life's petty annoyances within newsgroups, chat rooms and blogs. ; It's main purpose is to dismiss annoying arguments, people and situations in a civilized manner without resorting to flaming, net hooliganism or other kinds of embarrassing behaviour. ; A way of saying 'this little thing will not get me down'. ; The use of the 'Fork Of Justice' ranges from literally using a fork to poke the offending party (in chat), posting a picture of a fork in a thread or blog, or as a comical over-played super hero roleplay.
