Brewbat
This is used in Merseyside and is a derogatory term used for someone who tends to fancy women (or men) who are not nice looking in any way shape or form. However, a shallow-hall effect takes place which distorts the connection between the eyes and the brain, causing them to completely misinterpret what they see, hence finding an unattractive person rather nice looking.
