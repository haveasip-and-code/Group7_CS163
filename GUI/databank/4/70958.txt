Single-sideband (SSB) voice transmission by radio. A derisive term used by amateur radio operators, particularly those who prefer conventional AM (amplitude modulation). Although SSB has become the most widely used mode of transmission for two-way shortwave voice communication, its audio quality has an inferior, scratchy, tinny sound that is very unpleasant to the ear.
