Pudgey Wudgey
Small round 15 year old who is very lazy. Tends to need poking with stick to be roused from slumber. Consumes astronomical amounts of food yet isn't the size of a walrus (hes the size of a sea lion. trust me theirs a difference). Not really fat but couldnt be labled anything else so he became the fat one. Highly intelligent just to lazy to put it to good use.
