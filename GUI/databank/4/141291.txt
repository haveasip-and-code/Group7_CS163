kluge
In the computer world: a clunky, unpolished, quickly thrown together, 'solution' that accomplishes the required task, but is the equivalent of a Band-Aid or a 'temporary support brace'. Kluges are often used when the problem must be corrected ASAP and no time is allowed for a formal solution, or when the person resolving the issue does not know how to fix it correctly. When used correctly, Kluges are always temporary and replaced by a permanent solution. Kluges are not look upon with high regard, and people who use kluges as permanent solutions are not look upon as good administrators or developers.
