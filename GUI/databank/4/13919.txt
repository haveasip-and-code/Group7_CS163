Bluebie
Used in the Halo video game series and Everquest. ; 1. A bluebie is one who is devoted to the 'blue' team in Halo and Halo 2. He will do anything in his power to obliterate all reds. If put on the red team, a bluebie will have a dangerous effect. These effects include team-killing, swearing, constant whining and stealing the best weapons/vehicles and hiding them. (Or, in some manners, blowing them up.) The bluebie is truly a marvel of discovery -- and also a very dangerous one if placed on the opposite team. ; 2. A bluebie in Everquest is one who will not engage in player vs. player combat.
