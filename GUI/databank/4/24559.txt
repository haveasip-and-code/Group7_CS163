Immanuel Kant
The famous 18 th century philosopher. To describe his moral philosophy he used this brillant metaphor: 'The moral law within and the starry sky above.' ; Despite massive intelligence, Immanuel Kant had never marriedn and had allegedly remained a virgin until his final hour. He also didn't like pictorial arts and had a pretty dubious taste in music. Instead of the German classical music giants, Kant preferred the municipal brass band playing free, open-air concerts in his native city of Konigsberg (Kaliningrad in Russian).
