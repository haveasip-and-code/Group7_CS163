Yuppie Wagon
An SUV that has soccer decals, with a 30 something woman driving. This species is generally seen wearing a sweater in 90 degree weather or has tied around her waist. Don't forget the cell phone. Phone Companies love these types as the phone is glued to the ear rambling endlessly on what the latest trend is....Good place to spot these is at any Coffee Culture location.
