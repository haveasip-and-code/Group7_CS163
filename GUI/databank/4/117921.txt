alto saxaphone
One of several instruments in the saxaphone family. The saxaphone is often confused with the saxophone, a wind instrument invented by Adolphe Sax in 1840. Saxaphone is a word used by uneducated simpletons that need to spend more time near a dictionary and less time trying to associate themselves with the many facets of coolness offered by the saxophone and legitimate saxophone players world-wide.
