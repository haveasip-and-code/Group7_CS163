Papadapoulos
The president of Cyprus. Despite the fact that he's political philosophy can be described as neo-Nazi he was elected president with the support of the communist party of Cyprus. He believes that he is Mr. Perfect. He ignores guidance and directions from the UN, the EU and the USA. He also prevents the general secretary of the UN to speak to the people of Cyprus. He cries in the TV in order to make people to follow his ideas. A democratically elected president but he manages to become a dictator. He controls all the media!
