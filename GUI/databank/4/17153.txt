ebaumsworld
A website created by Eric Bauman, filled to the brim with stolen content from other websites. Ebaumsworld recently stole from YTMND (You're the man now dog).com, and has stolen from sites such as SomethingAwful and Fark. Also, Eric posted malicious code on the front page of Ebaumsworld, that wasted their bandwidth, which is illegal.
