woot
1.Originally written simply as woot (or WOOT) abreviation of Wu-Tang, specifically referring to the Wu-Tang Ninja Clan (Dungeons and Dragons nonsense based off of the music group) made by Aaron A. of CA in 1997.This was done in order to spam Aaron and his brother with WOOTs over ICQ. Aaron thought it was funny,but Greg hated it. It eventually drove him nuts resorting in him running around EverQuest as his Iksar Monk screaming woot wherever he went,and eventually in him even spamming chat rooms and other on-line games(even Yahoo chess) alike. Also the DM (Dungeon Master) who created this' good friend Hell Fire spammed up Quake2 with it back in 97'. ; 2.Nonsensical gibberish you can just shout cause it's funny,and gets annoying really fast. ; 3.Warped into w00t by on-line nerds trying to make sense of 4 people shouting it all over the place, resulting in Quake2 players rationilizing it as We Own (the) Other Team, seeing that it became most fun to shout specifically as players where fragged, or at the end of matches. Also fabricated by EverQuest players to mean 'I won the battle' or 'I leveled' or some other cool event, due to people just asking Greg,'Hey what does that mean?...it sounds cool..does mean huzzah or victory?', and him only answering with 'uh yeah, sure' or with more woots. This eventually evolved to w00t due to sheer bordom of saying it all the time. ; 4.An obnoxious spam tactic where one types it several times, copies, paste, repeats. This is known specifically as 'The Attack Of A Thousand Woots'.
