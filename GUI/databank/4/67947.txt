backy
Like a nammer, but instead of coming from the south side of Vietnam, they come from the north side of Vietnam. The guys are usually found wearing Kappa clothing, Nike Shox with dyed blonde or red bangs. The girls are usually found wearing TNA suits or Triple Five Soul, and like the guys, they also wear Nike Shox. The girls have layered hair that is either dyed all red, all blonde, or streaked red or blonde.
