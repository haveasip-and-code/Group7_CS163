However, the technique has been shown before on earlier Street Fighter predecessors. ; Shown when you meet the requirements to fight against Akuma. Initially, you get a intro scene against M.Bison but then afterwards you see a dark figure from the skies come crashing down with a karate chop slashing M.Bison from head to floor; killing him.
