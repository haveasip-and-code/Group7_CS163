A truck made by Dodge from about '70-78 which was a black painted version of the Little Red Express Truck. It came with a 360 ci motor, and an A-833 standard tranny with pistol grip. The rig-style exhaust stacks gave the truck a hella mean look, and it had speed to match. Optional W-2 cylinder heads were available. One kick ass truck!
