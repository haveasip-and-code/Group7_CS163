Make a thread about it
A commonly used reply on [mx] to stupid or whiny posts. Users of the phrase would eventually become victims of the ban-axe, but it resurfaced in a particularly hilarious thread, when a user retold an event of his day whence he had told an obese, obnoxious girl to 'make a thread about it' whatever she was bitching about, which was interpreted as 'have a period about it'. User got in major trouble with authority. We laughed. The thread inspired others to admit to using web language by accident in real life. We laugh at them (me) too.
