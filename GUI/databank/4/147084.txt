screenbathing
For someone to sit in front of a screen (e.g. computer, television or gaming system) for a long period of time. This activity often results in a screentan; unlike a suntan, screentans make the skin whiter from lack of sunlight. Screentans can also be referred to as screenbleaches for this reason.
