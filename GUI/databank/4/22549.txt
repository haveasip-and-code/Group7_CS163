water sport
Watersports lovers enjoy not just the flesh of their partners but also the secretions that flow from it. This fetish may also include a fascination with the one function (peeing) that their partner has been doing since birth.Generally speaking, for men the sensation of liquid passing through their urethra is exactly the same when they ejaculate as when they urinate. Even though men know the difference of whether they're cumming or urinating, the sensation is the same. Therefore, for watersports lovers, one action reminds them of the other. Likewise for females, their urethra opens and urine flows out of and among the sensitive lips of their body.
