Southwestern University
Extremely small, gorgeous university in the suburbs of Austin, Texas. Popular location for the studies of spoiled, well-maintained, rich kids. With approximately 3 girls for each guy enrolled, Southwestern University is an excellent school for less-then attractive rich boys to flash their cash and get laid, while forcing the very attractive females to adjust their standards. With such a small student body, and huge girl-guy ratio, the dating pool is inevitably inter-crossed between friends, ex's and drunken hookups from the previous Wednesday of skanky fraternity partying. An excellent choice for the '[daddy's girl]' and the '[tool]' guy who needs a fraternity to fit into. All-in-all, students are very happy with their lives while at Southwestern.
