Kiss the Jesus
Catholic Church code phrase used by Priests whilst in the confessional instructing the unwary confessee to 'Kiss the Jesus.' This is always accompanied by the sound of a zipper coming down in a rapid manner and a loud, 'BOING-ing' sound as the erect penis of the Priest, at the sight of a ten year old boy, pops out of his Cassock.
