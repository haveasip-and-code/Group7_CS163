labia majora
Noun: (Latin)A technical medical term to describe extremely large piss flaps. Women are rarely born with this condition. Rather, it develops over time as a direct consequence of very frequent vaginal sex - e.g. found in women that have sex 6 times a day. No prizes for guessing that prostitutes and porno stars are the largest group suffering this condition. It can be rectified by plastic surgery.
