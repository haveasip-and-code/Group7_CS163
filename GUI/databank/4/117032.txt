Brett Favre
Brett Favre may not be the best anymore as he once was but he is certainly one of the best. Everyone is too hard on him for not being what he once was. That's ridiculous because they're insulting one of the best quarterbacks to ever play football. Naturally you can't expect him to be that good forever. He ages ya know...
