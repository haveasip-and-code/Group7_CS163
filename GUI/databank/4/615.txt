I-town
To dispel any rumors or confusion that might be going around, I-town is an abbreviation for Irvine, California! It is commonly used by Katie Bentley and Amy Frueh. Now Pavan Hari thinks that he coined this phrase with his boys back in Miami like Usher and A-Town, but really we ALL know it goes back to Katie and Amy and no where else.
