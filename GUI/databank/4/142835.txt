Suburbs
Usually a nice environment to live in. Little noise, not as busy as the city, and usually pretty safe. Sometimes generates ignorant and stuck up people in its schools and not everything is in walking distances. People say it is a terrible place to live, but if you are financially stable enough to live there, then it is obviously worth it.
