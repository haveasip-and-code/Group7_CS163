I love the 90's
Spinoff of VH1's hit series, [I love the 80's], it consists of semi-celebraties reminissing about the not-so-distant past. Has a very misleading name. Should be called 'I thought the 90's were kinda cool when they were happenening but now is the ideal time to make snide remarks about them'
