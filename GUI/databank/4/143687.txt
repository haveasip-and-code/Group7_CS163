Suv
Well they started off being four wheel drive trucks with perminate back shells on. So they were both a truck and an off road vehicle and could seat more passengers. Now everyone calls everything an suv, even if it does not have four wheel drive. I think we should start calling them by there real name like, rodeo, jeep, 4 runner, tahoe etc...
