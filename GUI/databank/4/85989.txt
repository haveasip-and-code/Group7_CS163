Cholo
The U.S. context of the word Cholo/Chola originated in Los Angeles and can be a derogatory term meaning [Chicano]gangster or [pandillero]or [marero]. They are born in the U.S. and favor Spanglish. They might refer to any Latino unlike them as [pocho], or white-washed. ; A hardcore cholo will wear the baggy look, bigtime tatoos, and a shaved head. The chola might have long permed black hair, dark lipstick and a teardrop tatooed under her eye, (and their toddler might have a shaved head and wear the garb unless [abuelita] steps in.) ; This look is subject to change as gang-culture evolves. So what a cholo looked like in the times of [Cheech and Chong] is out-of-date, but still revered with some pride. There are even plastic figurines with this look sold in gumball machines all over the streets of L.A. ; The word has a totally different context in South America, where it means indigenous peasant. But in the States, it has been appropriated and the context has evolved.
