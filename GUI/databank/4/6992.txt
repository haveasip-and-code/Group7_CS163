Democracy
A system within which fairness and merit is despensed with in favour of empowering idiots. ; As Plato pointed out - the people do not always know best, even what is best for them (in the same way a small child doesn't!) ; Current democracies feature governments with the support of a minority of the population and a bias towards those who form the majority and so therefore have their every whim pandered to on the basis that it wins votes.
