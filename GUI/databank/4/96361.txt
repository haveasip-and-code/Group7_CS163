Black National Anthem
Since it's an illegitimate national anthem (unless someone can prove to me that a country named Black does, in fact, exist), it's a racial anthem, designed to foster division, and alienation, among blacks in America, by making them believe that they're not Americans, but members of another nationality, one based on race. If you still don't see anything wrong with a Black National Anthem, then imagine if it was called the White National Anthem. ; See [diversity] ; See [multiculturalism] ; See [fifth column]
