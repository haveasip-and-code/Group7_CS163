palsied limmo
n. An ingenious contraption designed to harness the convulsing limb power of those heavily afflicted with cerebral palsy, and convert it into a uniform forward motion. The name limmo is derived from the pseudo word 'limb-bo', as the limbs of the pilot are strapped in securely to avoid self-harm. ; First documented in an obscure South African science journal, the 'limmo' developed a cult following among the Joey Deacon generation of jive-talking office workers. ; Read the archived article (and see a great pic of the limmo!) at: ; www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2003/november/limmo.htm
