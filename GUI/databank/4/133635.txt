Bumped
1. Getting the raw end of the deal. Usually short changed by some cheap barmaid. The word is an utterance of injustice, like some kind of 1980's victim shit. ; 2. Convincing a girl that anal sex is a pretty good idea. Usually with the aid of some sort of drug/alchol. These slick bastards tell the girl 'its going to be alright' and 'i'll be gentle' and 'it's just another expierence, you like expierences right?' ; 3. Pimp talk for making your woman work all day and night and giving her nothing in return, except maybe a spanked ass and a cheese burger.
