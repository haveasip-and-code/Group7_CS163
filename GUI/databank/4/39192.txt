Vodka
Liquid found in rivers, lakes, bars, veins, rain, dew, and ground in and surrounding the quiant country of Poland. Its origins are most likely based off the Polish word for water (woda-->wodka(then through a dumb translation)-->vodka(stupid Anglo-Saxon pronounciation)). It is an odderless alcoholic beverage, and it is very potent. A Polish (and Russian/Ukranians) blood alcohol limit is higher (scientific fact) then other world ethnicitys because of the high consumption of this liquid over these countries history. Its dirt cheap. You can buy it anywhere from bars, liquor stores, gas stations, the guy down the street, to little Piotreks backyard shed. It comes in a wide variety of potencies, anywhere form 40% and up really. Take your pick. Most people who dislike the drink, have: 1.) Drank shitty Smirnoff (which is the WORST excuse for vodka I have ever had the displeasure of drinking a 26er of). 2.) Enjoy female drinks like American/Canadian beer/draft, coolers, or tasty(read=pussy) alcohols like 'sambuca' or 'flavored rums'. 3.) Never tried REAL vodka from: Poland, Russia, Ukraine, or any slavic nation. 4.) Have neve rhad Zubruwka (one of the best vodkas I ahve ever ahd the pleasure of drinking a 40 of).
