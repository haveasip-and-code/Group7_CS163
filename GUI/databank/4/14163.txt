meeps
Today someone asked me about meeps, I've been asked this question many times. Sometimes it comes as, 'What is a meeps?' or 'What does meeps mean?' I think some people think its supposed to be a means of telling them to move, like a car. Or some others think its some sort of insult - but it's not! I swear, there is no secret hidden meaning. ; Simply put meeps is anything you want it to be. Often intonation is the key to the meaning behind meeps. Say you're really annoyed, you can't just scream or have an 'I'm annoyed' expression on your face, but you can say meeps like you're annoyed and your present state of being is well known. Or if you're really excited, letting out a meeps is a good way to express it. ; Meeps can also be a name, for example my computer and car are both named meeps. It can be a filler, for example say you're thinking and someone is expecting some sort of response out of you - to stay them off from eating you up, just utter a meeps. You sound less dumb than an ....uhhh....uhhhh... and it will buy you some time.
