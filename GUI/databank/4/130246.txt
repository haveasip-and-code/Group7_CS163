The Eminem Show
The fifth album released by rap artist Eminem which sold over a million copies on it's first day and was the first of his albums where he actually showed some remorse for the things he has said. It featured the hit Single Without Me which had to be retired from the TRL charts as it was on top for a great amount of time and showed no signs of weakening.
