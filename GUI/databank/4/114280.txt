Ichiro
Right fielder for the Seattle Mariners. One of the best leadoff hitters in baseball. In 2004, he had 262 hits to break George Sisler's 84 year old record of 257 hits. Although he generally hits for average, he has the ability to hit homeruns as well. Also, he is one of the best defensive outfielders in baseball able to gun down runners at home plate with his strong but accurate arm.
