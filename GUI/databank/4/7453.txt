Death Chester
Back in the hayday of Hellaware and Killadelphia, some kids around here decided to start a crew to keep up. The hardcore scene had just gotten known around West Chester. The question was, what to call it? Something that had the same ring to all of those. Death Chester was then born. Eventually, it died off, not being as big as Killadelphia, and the whole state of Hellaware. ; Years Later, Steve Cockonis told Jason about this back in the day. I was like, hey, why not bring this ish back. There seemed like enough kids who'd be down. Now, we will fuck people's up once again.
