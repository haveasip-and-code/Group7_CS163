Dayton Flyer
A student solely committed to the act of alcoholism by purchasing the cheapest alcohol in an act to get drunk and save money for more alcohol in the future. They have the determination to get wasted by taking in Milwaukee's Best and Milwaukee's Best Ice while taking shots of Korski. They give up their taste buds so they can be unconsciously wasted. Their brain cells take a beating as they have been reportedly getting drunk on more than one weekday. Their innebriation due to alcohol should be modeled after.
