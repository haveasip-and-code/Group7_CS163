Jackie Martling
A.K.A. 'The Jokeman', Jackie Martling enjoyed a great deal of fame and fortune as a member and Head writer of [The Howard Stern Show]. Martling was notorious for his obnoxious laugh and internal squabbling with fellow cast members [Robin Quivers] and [Fred Norris]. ; In a shocking simultaneous display of greed and arrogance, Martling staged his own personal labour strike and refused to show up for work. This unfortunately backfired, as the substitutes filling in for him brought an energy to the show that had been long missed. As a result, Martling was released and now can be found on various Long Island beaches selling his 'jokeman' memorabilia.
