Animal
I know this definition will get voted down, because too many people here like murder, hate animals, and are overall [idiot]s. ; I always wanted to be an animal. ; I mean, wouldn't it be awesome to be a chicken? You have to jump over somebody to get to where you're going, you're swimming in your own feces, you're surrounded by a shitload of other chickens and then killed at the age of 2 months... erm... okay, a pig. ; You're castrated at birth and fed until you can't stand, and if you don't eat fast enough you're banged against concrete and shot if you aren't fat enough to slaughter... erm... cows? ; Being constantly pregnant so you can provide milk to another species and then when you aren't 'useful' enough you get to be turned into food... nope, being an animal kinda sucks.
