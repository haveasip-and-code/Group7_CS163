north allegheny
the best person ever goes to this school, but he is graduating this year. you probably dont know him. only because you arent cool enough to. this kid is possibly the most amazing person on this planet. i just love him with my entire heart. y'all shouldnt hate on north allegheny because you're poor and live in the equivalent of missouri's boothill in a doublewide. go cry about it to your daddy working in a coal mine.
