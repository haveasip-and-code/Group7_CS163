man boobs
You morons are all fucking stupid. Gynecomastia comes in two forms, one is caused by obesity where sometimes the fat stores in the chest area, creating breasts in fat men. The other one is caused by a hormone imbalance in men that causes breast tissue to form underneath the nipple area, so even if you are skinny, you can have big boobs. Don't feel bad if you have it, as there is a cure. Most plastic surgeons generally charge $1000-$5000 dollars to do a glandular excision and/or liposcution in that area, removing them. ; Many celebrities have it too, like Simon Cowell, for example.
