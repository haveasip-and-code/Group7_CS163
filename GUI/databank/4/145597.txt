pretendies
Slang for mid-grade pot. Short for 'pretend kind' buds. Usually a kind strain but poorly grown or accidently allowed to germinate from male plants. Still better than schwag, but not as good as kind. Going rates in Boulder, CO.. ; kind bud...$50 per 1/8th ounce. Very nice. No seeds. Smells/tastes great. 1-3 hits should do you. See Northern Lights. ; Pretendies...$100 per ounce. Usually green and fluffy. Perhaps some seeds. Smells/tastes good. May need 2-5 hits for nice groove. Sometimes called beesters. ; Schwag...$60 per ounce. Can be dark green or brown. Lots of seeds. Sometimes formed in brick squares. Smells/tastes earthy or like dirt. Will need 4+ hits to get high. Sometimes only produces headache.
