david sedaris
my favorite author in the entire world -- not one of his books will fail to make you laugh, and the funniest of the lot is 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' ; if you haven't read his stuff, you have to. ; Other works include: ; barrel fever ; holidays on ice ; naked ; dress your family is corduroy and denim
