Glass Ceiling
Some make-believe barrier that prevents lazy women from making as much money as they want. They make this 'glass ceiling' up in order to get the government to force business into giving undeserving women high positions. God forbid they actually WORK for it. ; Instead, we get excuses of fake barriers. We also hear bullshit about lower pay. What the feminists spouting out the bullshit leave out is that women get lower pay because they take more *off time*. They take time off for little injuries, fake sicknesses, weekly migrains, and whatever else they come up with. Included in this is maternity leave. Despite all of this, the only thing making women have lower pay is apparently the 'glass ceiling'. ; Yeah, tell that to all the women who got to top power positions in the world DECADES ago (when this 'glass ceiling' was in full force).
