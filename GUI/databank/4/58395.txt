lounsberry
One who, upon learning that he is not allowed to go to French convention, jumps out of his grandmother's moving van on the way to school and later walks home in a storm of teen angst. This is supplemented by the fact that he neither had keys to his house nor any money, and he does not know the alarm code for his house because his parents do not trust him at all.
