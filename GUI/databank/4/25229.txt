Mindless Contradictions
Mindless Contradictions experiments with Industrial/Progressive/Electronica combined...breaking ; barriers and bringing out the other side of Industrial Metal. Fast paced electronic beats fused with brain-crushing powerchords and quiet melodies bring out the best of such influences as Dream Theater, the Prodigy, and Nine Inch Nails.But don't think this is just another band trying to follow in the footsteps of their idols, copying the music note by note. ; This is something else entirely. And so is the music.
