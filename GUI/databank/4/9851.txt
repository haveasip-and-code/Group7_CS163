billio
from the australian outback. A billycan was something the aborigines boilded up their goodiesin, or whatever it is that they eat. Anyway, billio means boiling things up. therefore, 'my cheeks ache like billio' means- er- very achy.I dont know why we say it. Its a mystery, like many things. But that is the beauty of life.
