the 80s
Pertaining to the years 1980-1989. Being I was born in 1986, I really don't remember much of the eighties besides REALLY big hair. I mean, it was the 80s. And I'm from NEW JERSEY. People had enough hair to make a shag carpet. And of course hair was bleached blond and crazy colors. Other than that, the eighties is known for the birth of MTV, punk idols like Madonna, everything being 'awesome' 'tubular' 'rad' or 'bodacious'. people were into fitness also. Basically, the eighties was a special time, but its kind of like a girlfriend that you had great sex with, but was REALLY annoying.
