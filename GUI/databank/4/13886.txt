GTA5.com
A forum dedicated to the [Grand Theft Auto] game series. The website opened in Late 2003; now it's a shithole thanks to the uncaring Administrator there. It finally closed for good earlier this year, and most of the members have since moved to the website GTA-6.com, which is maintained by former GTA5 members. The GTA5 Admin stands out amongst a long line of fuckwits for not maintaining the Forums on a regular basis and never finishing the RPG system he promised.
