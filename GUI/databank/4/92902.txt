K-Tard
People who do lines of k in the bathroom of malls, then walk around really fucked up screaming at people and talking to strangers and making obscene gestures. These people also go to raves, fucked up on k, staring at visualizations, thinking they're on the moon, because they can't walk from all the k. Soon, they think they are gods or Al Pacino, and will start talking in a thick cuban accent telling everyone that they're going to get shit on.
