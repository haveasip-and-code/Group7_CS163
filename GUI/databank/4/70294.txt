crusty
imagine a person around 15 years old with long hair, huge baggy jeans with their underwear hanging out + a long sleeved t shirt with a shortsleeved t-shirt over it with a skateboard on it and 'rebel sk8er dude FX' on it, a skateboard under one arm and earphones permanantly lodged within their ears playing punk metal at extreme volume so that everyone within 10 metres can clearly hear the obscene lyrics, and who showers roughly 3 times a month. (the skateboard could also be replaced with roller blades.)
