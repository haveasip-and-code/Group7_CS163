Pink de Lish
Pink de Lish: what a word (or phrase if that's what you prefer). This word/phrase has two known meanings. First, it's one of the extremely intricate screen names on my AOL Instant Messenger buddy list. Secondly, it does a great job of describing one of nature's most ingenious inventions: the vagina. The perfect color of the vagina is 'Pink de Lish', as is the taste. The word/phrase 'Pink de Lish' is easily one of the most subtle ways to describe the vagina. Right before you plunge into that succulent vagina, think of the 'Pink de Lish' taste and you won't be surprised.
