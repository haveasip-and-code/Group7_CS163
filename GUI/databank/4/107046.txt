Shevella
Shevella ;A very rare girls name, scarcely containing no etymological elements common to most names of historical origin. Perhaps its origin began as Vella or Velia which comes from the Roman family name Velius which possibly means 'Concealed' in Latin. ; combined with the english pronoun for a female. She-Vella. (Her Hidden motives) or She Hides something. ; A very pretty name it seems fit for an angel. yet so strange how its avoided almost so completely it must have been given a repulsive reputation by the majority of so named.
