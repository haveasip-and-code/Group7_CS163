Union Beach
a little town off of the edge of Keyport no one kinda never heard of......it is full of hoods and poor people. It is one square mile, and has only one elementary school (k-8) and no high school. It also has a fun little beach but you can't really swim in the water because you will not get the odor out of your body for weeks. But, overall, it kinda sucks
