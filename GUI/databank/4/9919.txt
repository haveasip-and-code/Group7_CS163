Gameboy
A system that wasnt upgraded from its debut in 1989 to 1998. Crushed systems that had better technology, more colors on the screen and lit screens. Sole reason: The games. If the Gameboy were to ever die, it would be remembered as what kicked ass in the past. You dont need a powerful console to have a great game made for it.
