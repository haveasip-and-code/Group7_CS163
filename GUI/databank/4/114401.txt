gore metal
Gore Metal, like Black Metal, is a branch of Death Metal. As the name sugests, it talks about gore, blood, and dismemberment of body parts. The singer often sings in a very deep growl. I personally think this music is terrible, but I have some friends who enjoy it, and just because I think it's terrible, doesn't make it so.
