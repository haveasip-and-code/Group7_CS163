tent wars
A secretive farting contest held on boy-scout campouts. When chili is eaten for dinner, there will be one of these declared or otherwise. It is the act of building up a fart, and proceeding to somebody else's tent, unzipping their door, sticking your rear-end into the tent, and letting rip. Shortly after the gas is expelled, the door flaps are sealed so that the odor can permiate the opposition's tent.
