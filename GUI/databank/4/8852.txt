Scally
A youth cultar also known as 'tossers' the english eqivalent of red necks, so inbread they all seam to have incontinentia and cant afford the specil pants (thats why there socks are always over the pants) lots of burbury...often pink...hang around town and think if your not a scally your a 'MOSHA' if you have any black clothing on your a ' FOOKIN' GOTH'... great thing about scallys is they cant read so you can insult them as much as you like =p
