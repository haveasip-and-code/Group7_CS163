Ryan Cabrera
22 year old acoutic rock/pop artist who has been working at fame since his young teen years. Contrary to what many believe, he released an album around age 17 called Elm St, thus disproving the theory that he only gained fame because of his appearances on the Ashlee Simpson show. His lyrics are often deeper than most think, although you'd have to be a pretty big fan to care. He also enjoys imitating Napoleon Dynamite and just having a fun time on stage...He never fails to make the audience both laugh and 'aww' out loud at his concerts. ; For those less familiar, he's the hispanic looking(he's actually half Colombian) singer with the big spikey hair. You may have heard his singles 'Take It All Away,' 'True,' and '40 Kinds of Sadness' on the radio.
