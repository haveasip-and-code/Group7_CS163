disasterporn
What you see on TV when the news channels go into 24-hour disaster mode. As a viewer, you respond as you do for flesh porn -- you can't turn your eyes away, you keep coming back to it, you never are fulfilled after watching it, and you feel bad inside when you're done. For examples of disaster porn, withess Fox's coverage of the hurricanes of 2005, or CNN/Fox/MSNBC for the Sept 11, 2001 terror attacks.
