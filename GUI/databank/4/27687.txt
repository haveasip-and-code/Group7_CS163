United States of Canada
A sad, pathetic attempt by liberals to cope with the fact that their own self righteousness doesn't actually mean that they are right. Instead of graciously admitting that they are infact a minority in America, they would rather take their toys and go home, as evidenced by the 'USC', similar to the southern states succession, but without the backbone to actually do anything about it except talk.
