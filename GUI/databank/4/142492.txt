Joning
Making fun of a person to the point where they laugh uncontollably (or either feel like crying) <--- usually this one. ; Usually just sayin' ridiculous shit that comes off the top of your head. The truest jones are the funniest ones. ; The worst is group joning. Its halarious when you're high.
