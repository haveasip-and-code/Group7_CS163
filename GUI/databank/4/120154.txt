Conil
Only the BEST town ever in Spain! Located close to Seville and Cadiz, it is a jewel of the Andalusian province. It is both highly beautiful, with its pristine beaches and surrounding plains, and extremely fun, with a happening and spontaneous nightlife. ; Although dominated by Germans and Americans from ASA (go ASA Conil 05, best summer ever) in July, I highly suggest that you visit. Families there define the meaning of Spanish culture. Their food, clothing, attitude, and general perspective on life is 'precioso'. Conil is the place where true friendships are formed; it is a stronghold of important memories.
