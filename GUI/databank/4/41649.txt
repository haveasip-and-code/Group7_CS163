Neshaminy Mall
Mall located in Bensalem Pennsylvania. May indeed be the smallest mall in the world but still the best mall in the world. Every fri and sat night each entrance to this mall is infested with pre-teen smokers/'prostitots.' Also, Neshaminy Mall has, perhaps, the most loyal mall rats ever!!!!! (especially for being the smallest mall and not having that many stores or interesting sights)
