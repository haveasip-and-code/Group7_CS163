herbert
(Her - Bert) The generic term used to describe moronic sub-humans who loiter around outside tacky fast food resteraunts and off licences. The term can be used in conjunction [chavs] and [janners]. ; As a social class the Herbert prefers Burberry knock-offs Argos jewellery and cheap cider. The males are individually weak and easily scared off, yet in groups they can be intimidating bastards who will try to [ponce] anything from cigarettes to small change off you. ; Herberts are not only recognisable by their shitty dress sense they are also borderline Neanderthals. They possess no grasp of wit or irony - they are proud of there ignorance and take pleasure in insulting anyone with a grain more intelligence than they possess. I imagine that's why they are so obnoxious to everyone...
