ranger challenge
The ultimate in extreme sports, it requires you to wake up at 4 AM every single day and engage in grueling tactics and combatives training, and run a solid 5 to 10 miles a day while carrying about 80 pounds of gear on your person. Far manlier and more exhausting than any other 'extreme sport' (i.e., a bunch of douche bags chasing after a ball all afternoon and feeling hardcore afterwards).
