All American Rejects
Perhaps one of the worst bands to ever record music. Examples of All-American Rejects sucking ass can be seen in any of thier crap-hole songs including (but not limited to) 'Swing swing' and 'Dirty little secret'. These guys have zero talent and shouldn't offend peoples eardrums much longer, as thier 15 minutes of fame is on its 14th minute.
