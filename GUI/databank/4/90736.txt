thread stopper
A thread stopper is when someone writes such a good and/or long opinion in a forum, (or a definition on Urban Dictionary) that everybody else wants to match them but in the end doesn't write another opinion/definition because they can't write another one better! See [star fox] and also [desert eagle]
