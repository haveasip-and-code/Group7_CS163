rwnt
A take on 'pwnt', which is a take on 'pwned' which is a take on '[owned]'. ; [Pwned] came around through the common misspelling of 'owned' (due to the close proximity of O and P on the keyboard), and althought originally a typographical error, through its overuse it entered the vernacular as a word in itself. The -t suffix being used to replace -ed is self explanitory, adds a heightened level of [leetness] to leet insults. ; The r- prefix stands for 'royally', and thus, translates to 'royally owned'.
