cece brown
Cecelia is the chic-est chick in town. She has a knack for English Class. Beacuase of her extensive English skills and lovely coolness, flocks of boys come running to be by her side. She is gorgeous and fun to be with and the koolest, raddest, baddest female friend ever to walk on the Earth. Even though she is a brunnette she has her blonde moments. She has choco brown eyes and chesnut hair flavor with the cutest little freckles to add to her beauty. Aight PEACE!
