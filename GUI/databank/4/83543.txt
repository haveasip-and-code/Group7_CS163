gay guys
many people think gay guys are just some dudes who like other guys...but there is much more to it! you have to have style, co-ordination and of course the ability to clap your hands excessively and jump up and down at anything, jack off will and grace is my favourite example followed by shaun off coronation street. To be a gay guy you have to know everything there is to know about fashion and be loveable and sexy and fun!!!
