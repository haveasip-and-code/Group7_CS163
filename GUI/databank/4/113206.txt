Dots
A super-frozen ice-cream concoction that when first removed from the uber cooler they are stored in, will sear themselves on to your tongue and lips...after about 3 minutes, the dots are melted enough to eat like ALMOST regular ice-cream...at least the ones that you didn't shovel out on to the ground from the too-small dish or foil packet that they are served in. Comes in a variety of flavors and are delish!(Their official name is Dippin' Dots)
