Tekken
Tekken is a fighting game that is developed by Namco. starting its roots on the Playstation with Tekken, Tekken 2 and Tekken 3 (best one, in my humble opinion) and later carried on to the [Playstation 2] with Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken 4 and Tekken 5. Though the game is a classic in the fighting genre of videogames, It offers no new game play. Basically you're being sold the same thing in different packaging with a few new perks.
