blud rafoo
A quality beverage shared between three and four people. get a saucepan and fill with the a bottle of the crappiest vodka, crappiest whisky and finest brandy (each 70cl) and one bottle of crappiest strawberry flavoured soda crap (2 litres) and mix. Pour into pint glasses and enjoy with loud music and mayhem. two pints of this shit will fuck you up majorly. when drinking shout 'blud rafoo' at regular intervals. Comes from the south african phrase 'blud rivier' which means 'blood river' which unfortunately refers to some massacre sometime which made a river go red with all the blood. but who cares cos you wont remember this after a pint.
