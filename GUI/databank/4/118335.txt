vendamned
This is a contraction of 'heaven' and 'damned'. Given that humans advance in conciousness over multiple lifetimes until enlightened, enthrallment with a lower heaven or the idea that a lower heaven is THE heaven can effectively damn a person to repeated cycles of rebirth until the spiritual realization that more work lies ahead, as do higher heavens and true enlightenment. While evil doers may be sentenced to stays in hell worlds, doers of good can be 'sentenced' by their actions to lower heavens until the work of consciousness raising progresses and placement in higher heavens is realized.
