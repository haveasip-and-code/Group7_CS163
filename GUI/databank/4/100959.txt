sonofa
contrary to what you might think it should be prounounced as (so no fa) this word is actually son of a. It is usually followed by slut, or bitch. or my favorite, prostitute monkey. It is important that you do not prounounce it so no fa, as that is the name of an all girl band. and i don't think 'so no fa slut' will sound very threatening in a verbal war.
