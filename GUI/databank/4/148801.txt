Marshvegas
small beach town who's population literally doubles in the summer time. Used to be called Marshvegas for the horseraces at the fair - now it's more because of the lights that never turn off in the center. Not to mention all of the drama that goes on - but what happens in Vegas NEVER stays in Vegas. Lots of partying due since there's nothing else to do - except when the Marshfield Fair is in town, and then we all get drunk and go there. ; i love my hometown. :0D
