Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat
Possibly the worst musical ever. Written by the idiot composer [Andrew Lloyd Webber], it's the retelling of the Bible story of Joseph, done through silly, lighthearted songs. The Pharaoh is depicted as [Elvis] (???), and there is a country song, a [reggae] song, and a Jazz song. All of these are anachronisms, as well as being incredibly stupid and contributing nothing to the story.
