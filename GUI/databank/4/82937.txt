cockblind
1. Someone who cannot see the truth of something or otherwise says, justifies, covers for, or even praises something or someone that is untrue, unlikely, unattainable, unflattering, wrongheaded or plain impossible because they are thinking less with their brains and more with their dick (or vagina... women do this too), which ofen times blinds the best of men to reality. This is especially relevant when it pertains or relates to a woman, women, and the things they do or say. Often seen or heard when a man has become so whipped that he says things to make his girl happy or to convince his friends she's worthwhile *so* often that he says/does them without thinking and even starts to believe most of it after a time.
