Stat
Stat has a variable amount of meanings. If it is used as an insult to another person it means the person who is saying this word is extremely jealous of another person in the areas of female sexuality. The derivative of this word comes from the early 21st century by a poetic Chris Blain attempting to make an insult on a Royer, see definition. Since Royers cant be insulted the term changed to a more acceptable meaning.
