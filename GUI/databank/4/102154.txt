Martin Scorsese
One of the greatest filmmakers of all time, if not the best. His films are psychological dramas that focus the complexity of the character over plot and he's notorious for his sometimes, very brutal scenes of violence. He has been nominated for an Academy Award several times, but has not won one. His highlights include Goodfellas, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets, Casino etc.
