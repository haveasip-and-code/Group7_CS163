It's So Good
Once upon a time a young man smoked some very good gange, and as he smoked the delicious herb he shouted 'It's So Good!' From that day forward the expression is yelled by stoners when they smoke very good weed, or it can be said for anything that is exceptionally wonderful. It is commonly yelled with 'I Need it' and/or 'Oh My God'
