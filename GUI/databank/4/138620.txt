lurk more
A response designed to point out, on an internet messageboard or similar, that a person (the target of the command) is unfamiliar with certain inside jokes ([meme]), has not been around very long, or is a generally inept poster who needs to contribute less to the conversation ([lurk]) until he/she is more informed.
