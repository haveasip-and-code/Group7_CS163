An absolute funk/punk masterpiece presented to us by the red hot chili peppers. Riddled with awesome trumpeting ,its makes one so happy just to hear them deep grooves coming out the speakers. Produced by the 'epic mythological profilic genius' himseld Dr Funkinstein, George Clinton, this record remains a definitive and substantial musical statement, and from the words of Flea it falls into the category 'Too funky for white radio, too punk rockin for black.'
