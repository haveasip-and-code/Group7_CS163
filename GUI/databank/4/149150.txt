Payce
It is a way to say 'I'm out' of a conversation when you are chatting online. Another way of saying 'Peace' or 'Duece', but being chill about it. And, chill / laid back now a days seem to be reflected by the word 'Payce'. ; This has nothing to do with someone trying to impersonate a Black person, its the attitude / emotion being replicated.
