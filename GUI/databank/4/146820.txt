Sneed
SNEED; The Sneed is a computer program developed at Toys R Us by Mike Drake and his Boy's World Team (sometimes known as Drake's Action Rangers) in 2000 and 2001. The original Sneed was developed to look at the inventory for one category of merchandise in a single store and determine how much product that store needed based on past sales history and determining how much they would receive after rounding that need to the case pack. Other versions of the Sneed were developed to look at entire areas or regions and make the same calculations and another version was developed to 'ramp up' sales for the winter holidays. Ostensibly the name 'Sneed' meant 'store need' but Drake would often reveal it was actually a reference to the [Dr Suess] book The Lorax in which a sneed is a thing that everyone wants and nobody cares how they get. Drake and his team often felt this was how the stores viewed product.
