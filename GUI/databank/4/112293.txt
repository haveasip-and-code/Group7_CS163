Gary Ewing
The middle and misplaced Ewing son from the shows 'Dallas' and 'Knots Landing'. Gary was artistically inclined and favored by his mother Miss Ellie while being bullied by older brother J.R. and disowned by father Jock. Gary ended up running away a few times from his home and his wife Valeen before finally settling down @ Knots Landing with the help of his brother Bobby and Miss Ellie. Gary rarely returned to Dallas on account of J.R. and his new troubles @ Knots Landing.
