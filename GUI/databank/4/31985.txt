Quinn Allman
The guitarist of [The Used]. Absolutely fxcking awesome. He is not only extremely talented (The Used's guitar tracks are pretty hard to play) but breathtakingly gorgeous. Also, in the album cover of [In Love And Death] he said, '... Joseph Smith the greatest fiction writer of the latterday next to Tolkien.' That is a statement to respect.
