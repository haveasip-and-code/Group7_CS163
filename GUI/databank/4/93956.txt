ICQ
A chat-programm (I SEEK YOU) where you can instant message people in your list. ; People first get an ICQ number ; which can be send to others so that they can add you to their buddies list. ; Fortunantly, there is an 'AUTHORIZE' option , ; so random people can't add you if you don't want it when they found ; you through the search option. ; The best option is the Invisible Mode: ; people can't see your online status, ; except if you want them. ; You can add them into your visible list. In contrast to that, there is also an Invisible-list. ; ICQ makes very unsociable if you talk to many people. It's a real time killer. ; Only use it for talking to friends from the realworld. ; One advice: TURN OF THE SOUNDS , IT WILL MAKE YOU INSANE....
