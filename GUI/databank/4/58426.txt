scrumtrulucent
Coined by none other than WILL FERRELL on a skit where he was playing james lipton or someone and he was interviewing someone. the whole thing went something like this; 'your preformance in ----- was spectacular...no... breathtaking...no... infact there is no existing word yet to accurately describe the glory of your preformance so i shall create one and that word is... scrumtrulucent.' i'm not sure on the spelling and i recall it being prenounced like 'skrum-true-less-ent' but this guy had a close definition so whatever.
