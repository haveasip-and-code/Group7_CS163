energy drink
A reliable drink that contains many materials that end in '-ine' that make you both very hyper and mentally concentrated at the same time. Although it says on most energy drinks to not drink more than 2 servings a day, most people tend to chug down 2-3 times that amount daily just to feel the rush. This is usually considered as 'unhealthy' and 'reckless to the EXTREME,' but many people tend to ignore these warnings and do it anyway.
