pneis?
'pneis?' was first developed in the online game red orchestra. the user [13th]rhohan/66 had an obsession with the word 'penis'. he kept accidentally typing the word 'pneis' instead. due to the voice activation of ut2004, 'pneis' is pronounced similiar to the word 'nice'. rhohan enjoyed this, and this became his motto. he is now greeted while entering a server, with at least 2 people saying 'pneis? rhohan!' ; there is no explanation for pneis?. there is no meaning. pneis? is not to be confused with penis. there is no excuse for pneis?.
