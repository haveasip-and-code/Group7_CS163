The term was derived from the college by the Appalachian baseball team initially to describe a time when Coach Boykin would make a player do something the player would rather not do. Since Boykin was a coach, there was not much a player could do. Mostly, it was used to describe the person on whom Boykin abused his power, and was therefore widely considered a dick. Bartoned would later come to use in everyday life around Boone, NC when something funny would happen to another person. Boykin is a bitch.
