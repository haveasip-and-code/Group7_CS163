Shoppy
Sometimes it no longer becomes clear as to where you are currently located, and in such a situation one might consider it to be shoppy. ; Shoppiness often is associated with not knowing where you are, but can also refer to a plethora of alternate situations in which an individual is beyond 2 standard deviations away from the normal curve on a scale of having a 'cloodle'.
