underdog
An underdog is something that always seems to be trailing behind, but not always as bad as what's more popular. Often times when an underdog becomes more know, people new to it tend to cram it down your throat and preach to you how much better it is then everything else. They will also go on Urban Dictionary and write definitions about how great it is, and trash everything else.
