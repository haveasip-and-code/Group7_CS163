As a joke
Taken from the teenage chav character Vicki Pollard in the British comedy sketch show Little Britain. ; Often adds this onto the end of her very fast ignorant chav sentences to qualify something really stupid she has done. ; Can be added to the end of any appropriate (or, in fact, inappropriate) sentence in everyday conversation to make it sound funny/'cool'/common/comically ignorant/indicate a joke. Must be said in Vicki's unique accent blend of west country chav.
