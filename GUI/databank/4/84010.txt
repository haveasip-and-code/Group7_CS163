yuppie puppie
One who is raised by yuppies. Since all yuppies themselves are different, their offspring also vary. Most, though, grew up riding in the back of a Volvo station wagon on the way to soccer practice. Some went to private schools, where as others attend public school so that their parents can condescend the morons that generally are a dime a dozen in public school. The average yuppie puppie was taught to read college textbooks in preschool but will ultimately spend a lifettime living off of mom and dad.
