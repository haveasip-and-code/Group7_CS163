surendra
A fat indian chief who used to attend Christ's College in finchley north london. Was known to be a bullshitter with his many tales (including the uncle in India who broke Bruce Lee's arm and the bed that tosses you off if you ain't a family member), also known for his back problems which he never failed to remind us of...and we never failed to take advantage of (pileups in the corridor, rushing him in the playground and booting him in the back). A true patriot of India yet probably doesn't even know where it is on the map.
