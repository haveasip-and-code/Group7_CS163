the shining
A great book by Stephen King, but about 95% of the assholes who have only seen the movie don't have a damned clue that Stephen King wrote the book, let alone the fact that it was based on a book. ; In the book, the dad doesn't kill Hallorann (the black cook), Hallorann escapes with the mom and her son Danny, and the dad dies in an explosion inside the building. There is no scene with the trycicle and the two girls, nor is there a 'Here's Johnny!' scene. Get over it.
