Hannibal Lecter
Coolest Book charector ever? Quite Possible. Was in 3 movies, who was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins (Who was an INCREDIBLE Hannibal) and 3 Books (Red Dragon First, Then Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal Last) which was written by Thomas Harris (Who is one of the BEST writers ever, alongside of Stephen King) If you were fortunite to see Silence of the Lambs, you would know the greatness of Hannibal Lecter. How he seems to be your friend, how he is calm even when he kills people, how he knows everything that is happeneing, and he never loses his cool. Hannibal PWNS j00
