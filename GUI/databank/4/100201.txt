Bunnell
Noun. An amazing, incredible or miraculous avoidance of a traffic disaster whilst travelling at reckless speeds, often involving teenagers or alcoholics/crack addicts. Named in honour of Sherriff John Bunnell's voice-over commentary on the TV series 'World's Wildest Police Videos', in which he proclaims many of the fleeing suspects to have 'amazingly', 'incredibly' etc. cheated death in their high-speed attempts to escape.
