pennsylvania
A nice state on the east coast where it probably sucks to live, unless you live in the southeast like I do. (and I DON'T mean Philly) The suburbs of Philly are the nicest places in the world, Drexel Hill and the Main Line being the best of course. The roads do suck it's true, but if you put out the money to attend one of the many prep schools in the area, the education you'll receive it top shelf. And you can buy alcohol on Sundays. Also home to the second biggest mall in the country, King of Prussia. (named after *gasp* the KING of PRUSSIA)
