CZW
Combat Zone Wrestling is an independant wrestling promotion based around the east coast area. Owner and wrestler John Zandig (real name: John Corso) has spent the last six years developing his promotion into what it is today: a sickening, grotesque, and just plain stupid brand of wrestling that he likes to call 'Ultraviolent.'
