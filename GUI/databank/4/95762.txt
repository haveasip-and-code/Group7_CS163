Rumple
When stoned, to perform a dance entertaining your fellow stoners with humourous rhytmic movements to the beat of jaunty, bouncy songs. Culminates in the rumpler placing one leg on aan available plinth (chair/table/tree-stump) and thrusting his arm triumphantly in the air clutching a broom/stick etc.
