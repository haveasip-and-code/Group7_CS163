GS500
Suzuki's entry level sportbike. A 487cc, 4-stroke, twin cylinder, air-cooled, 6 speed peice of solid engineering. Excellent for commuters and those looking for a first bike but are wise enough to spend a few seasons on something more tame before moving up to a GSX-R or 600cc+ supersport. Also see [GS500F] the full fairing version of the GS500.
