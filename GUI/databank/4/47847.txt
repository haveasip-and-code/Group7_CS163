Wrestling Mark
A fan of wrestling who ; 1. Does not, or chooses not to, follow the backstage politics of the actual sport ; 2. Prefers to beleive in the characters and angles they watch unfold on telivision as 'real', unaware of how choreographed and pre-arranged it is ; 3. Prefers to cheer for a specific wrestler even if general consesus by thr Intenet majority is that they suck balls. ; 4. Is a total dumbass redneck member of the audience who needs to stop living in 1998 and learn the days of Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock are long dead.
