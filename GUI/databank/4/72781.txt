Az
(Spelled Az or Azz) This word originated in a smoky Annapolis/Crownsville, MD loft but quickly caught on and has since taken on various meanings. Originally, the word was a simple exclamation comparable to 'Damn!' or 'Word!' If something was particularly astounding, the word 'great' could be added as a prefacing qualifier, resulting in the exclamation 'Great Az!' This pronouncement could also be used as a subtle indicator that a person was attracted to someone. While walking behind the object of their affection with a friend, one could exclaim 'Great Az!' as if responding to something that was said by their friend, but also insinuating that they found the rump before them to be desirable. Unfortunately, the word's true meaning has been diluted by it's over-use as a form of the word 'ass.'
