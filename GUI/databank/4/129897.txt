4Wheel Man
A 4x4 vehicle. This term is used when a woman is driving one of these types of vehicle. So called because it gives her a feeling of strength, protection, and security that she would have if with a man. It also makes her taller than the other drivers so she can feel superior and more masterful than other drivers i.e., masculine. ; If there is a man in the passenger seat, you'd really better watch out as she will be feeling double-masculine.
