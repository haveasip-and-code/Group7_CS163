english barbecue
The English BBQ normally takes place in wet or threatening weather condition. He, the man of the house, shows his family how to light the BBQ using several pints of high octane fuel. He then cooks chicken drumsticks that are black on the outside and still bleeding in the middle. Sausages are also black on the outside while being raw in the middle.
