website tagging
This is meant as a continuation of the first definition found on this page. But since the system is a tad bit weird, I assume this will be the first definition, so look for the other one first and read it. ; Website tagging, as of 20th april, thanks to Kyle Welsh and myself also means 'defacing' a website so that it appears thruthful to it's original form, but the content is completely changed. Great examples of this are Kyle's 'Gaygle' and 'Unibrow'(Unicef), and DJ's Mclawsuit. ; We are pioneers of this, so let it be known where credit is worth.
