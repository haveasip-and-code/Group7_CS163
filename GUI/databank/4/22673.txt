piquetero
Spanish for 'picketer', the term has come to refer in English mainly to the Argentine unemployed workers' movement who have spearheaded repeated waves of protest involving blocking and barricading roads. The term is now sometimes used for those who use similar tactics, even in non-Spanish-speaking countries.
