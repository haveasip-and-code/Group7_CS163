nondescriptoid
Often fat, more often useless city employee whose job depends on not being cut in the next election. Uniformed, enraged and irritable from their inability to move more than ten feet without sweating, perfectly informed about city politics and the best ways to get the best of one's fellow man. *AVOID AT ALL COSTS!* These creatures are dangerous, spiteful and ready to abuse their position when crossed.
