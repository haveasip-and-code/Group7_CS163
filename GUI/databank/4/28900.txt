geek
A Geek Should NEVER be Confused With a Nerd. Geeks are different in that they do possess social skills, albeit Bizarre ones. Geeks like Star Trek, etc, but also have friends usually, among the mosher/goth community, if not other geeks. A geek is usually physically weak, but his/her goth/mosher friends will often stand up for him/her, as the geek usually puts his friends first. They have a pathological hatred of [Townies], [Preps}, and [Chavs], and tend to have good taste in music i.e. Punk. They do not get on With [Nerds], but will unite with them to pick on [dorks], unfortuneately.
