American Eagle 
American Eagle is a clothing store that is located in many malls. Its clothing perks the interest of many preps. Preps get made fun of by poor people who wear reebok and nike shirts, Gothic people who wear all black and well, hate everyone cuz thats what they do....hate life and hate everyone in it. Kinda pointless way to live life , no? People who shop at AE are often called tools, but that doesnt make much sense because the people calling us tools are usually tools themselves....yeah look at you gothic people, all sporting the same black T. Anyways, AE is a great store, you can buy great clothes there at a pretty high price, but who cares the clothes look great.
