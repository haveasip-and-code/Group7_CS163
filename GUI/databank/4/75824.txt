rockford
Craptastic city in northern Illinois. Only slightly less godawful than Freeport (only because of its size). Rockford is home to a million boarded up victorian mansions doomed to rot. It's home to a buttload of broke-ass niggas angrily wanderin' the streets. It's home to a gaggle of cantankerous crackas wearing sleaveless shirts that say 'Git R Done.' It's home to not one but two cruddy wal marts, each featuring an assortment of side-show freak customers that must be seen to be believed. You always get a bizarre show when you visit Rockford, but it's not necessarily a show you want to see.
