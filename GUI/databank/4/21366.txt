Moneyball
A book written by Billy Beane, er, Michael Lewis about the 2002 Oakland A's and their quest to reach the playoffs. It discounts some baseball fallacies (i.e. a player can be judged by physical talent alone) and explores the methods of rating players. Thus, teams with little money (such as the A's) can find out who the best available players are and acquire them.
