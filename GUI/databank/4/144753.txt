Ride the Lightning
Quite the album. Except for one song, all of them are quality. The exception is Fight Fire With Fire. Ya. In my opinion tied for Metallica's second best album with the [black album], and behind [Master of Puppets]. However, It has my two fave Metallica songs being Fade to Black and For Whom the Bell Tolls. But all of the songs are amazin, you just never listen to them. The title song is amazin.
