Buseyed
Pronounced 'Busey'ed. Derived from the relationship between Gary Busey and Nick Nolte, also commonly referred to as 'the poor man's syndrome'. This is when the person who looks like the retarded you is suddenly cast into the limelight while you, after all your hard work, are left standing in their wake.
