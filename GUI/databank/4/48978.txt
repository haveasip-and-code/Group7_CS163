high brass
This lil' gem originated in Watkinsville, Georgia in the year 2004. It is in reference to high power 12-gauge shotgun shells. They are easily recognized by the fact that the brass travels a good way up the shell, more brass equals more power, which equals more fun! Ideal for use in an [AK-12].
