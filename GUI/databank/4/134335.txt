Ghost Unit
A rip off of G-unit. Started by 3 white kids from Calgary Alberta, the group came out with one song that was all freestyle. Philly, Whitey and Timmons are the members. The song is called Ghost Unit. ; The Game (ex-g-unit soldier, kicked out by 50 cent) resently put out a cd titled 'Ghost Unit'. This cd repediately bashes G-Unit members; 50 cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck.
