mall security
usually employed by a contracted 'security' company, these people are given absolutely no means to control dangerous situations, but are expected to keep things under control until the police arrive. their job is to give the 'perception' of security, without actually having to go through the hassle of having real training. usually known as [rent a cops], they must also deal with a complete lack of respect from the patrons of the mall they serve. low pay and horrible hours make the job ideal only to lazy fat people and college students.
