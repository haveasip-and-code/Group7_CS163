Websense
Basically a bunch of nonsense. ; Websense is software that messes with your internet connection in that if you try to go to a certain page in the internet, it goes through the Administrator and Websense first, and if Websense has it on its little blacklist for any particular reason, you will not be allowed to view the site. This is called proxy. ; Seems innocent enough at first, but that it is before you realize its ultra-sensitivity. Websense is critical of what you view. You're not allowed to view image searches in Google for example (you can in Yahoo), which is completely harmless (depending on what you're searching for.) Anything with any sort of ties to recreational activities is shot down immediately. For example, any website under Web Hosting (Angelfire and Tripod are examples that host webpages), is blocked regardless of its content, but because of the category 'Web-Hosting.' ; All in all, Websense is Nazi Software/Software that is too tough on restrictions. ; *Bypassing Websense...* ; There are some websites that help with Proxy-Avoidance (another filtered category for the most part.) But the easiest thing to do is to go to a webpage translation service, such as WorldLingo. Set your languages, and you're done. I don't believe that you can send data while using WorldLingo however, i e you can't login to any sort of account.
