weal player
A weal player is a wanna be real player. I dont know why anyone would want to be a weal player.... ; The method of putting a 'w' instead of the first letter of a word to mean wanna be works for lots of other things, for example; warmer (wanna be farmer), wamster (wannabe hamster) and wemo (wannabe emo). ; These words are mainly use as mean terms for if you really hate someone.
