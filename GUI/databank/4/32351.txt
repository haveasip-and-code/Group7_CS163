summer aura
This band died because most of the people in belle vernon hated them with a passion..although their drummer was good, he was an asshole. their singer was monotone and looked like wolverine, their guitarists just talked way to much on stage but i admit were good, their bassist some believe is a troll(we still are not sure if he is or not)
