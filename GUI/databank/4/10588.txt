Italy
The greatest country in the world. Amazing architecture, nice people, great soccer games (called football over there), wonderful food ( Olive garden is not REAL Italian food) , drinking age is 16, and great weather. Ive looked at the other definitions of this country and the only two knocks on it are that its tv sucks and the toilets dont work. First off, the toilets work, that is not true. Second it is true that the tv is not great, but this is probably the reason italians have a wonderful, healthy lifestyle and Americans are fat and ugly. Plus with all the fun stuff to do there who needs tv. I am Italian and take great pride in saying that my family comes from this country. If you ever have a chance to go, DO IT!
