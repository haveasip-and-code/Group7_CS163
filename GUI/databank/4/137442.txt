VulgoZ
A term used for extremely intelligent and cool people or things. It can be used as an adjective or as a noun to describe whatever you think is better then you and the people in your direct surroundings. This term came alive a few years after the death of Jesus Christ. (Rumor: There was a priest named Vulgos who lived near Jerusalem that slayed the three Roman soldiers that killed Christ, using only his mind) In the present, it is used by a Dutch forumite, seen on 'WWW.GUNK.BE'. He offcourse, is equally cool and intelligent. The term is somewhat unknown in the normal world, but widely used on forums and the likes...
