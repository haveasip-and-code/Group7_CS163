paranoia agent
The latest (as of 2005) [anime] by famous director Satoshi Kon. His works include 'Millenium Actress' and 'Tokyo Godfathers.' Paranoia Agent follows the stories of victims of a would-be serial killer, but none of them are dead. This enigmatic attacker is known as Li'l Slugger, because he uses a slightly bend bat to strike his victims. This anime is not just a police drama though, for all the victims seem...relieved afterwards. All of them suffer from dangerous psycological symptoms, and were being pushed into a corner by events in their lives. The attacks come as a release, almost healing in a sense. This anime is very good, and it differs from the fantasy-sci fi normalicy of average anime. I would really recommend seeing it, and all of Satoshi Kon's works.
