wisbech
formerly wisbeach. inhabited by the lowest of the low, the stupid, the inbred and the rare breed of half-human, half-tracksuit [burberrious wankerous], which is a crude, low-life scallywag who only wishes to obtain cider or a knock off bottle of cheap 'voddy' to consume whilst sitting on the swings in the main park.
