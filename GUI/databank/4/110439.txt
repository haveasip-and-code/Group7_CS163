skiprat
One who burrows through the discarded debris in a skip, looking for items which may still be of value and/or useful to said skiprat. Much like a modern day Womble. Needless to say, such activity is viewed as 'a bit pikey' by the average man on the street, who prefers his kitchen sink to come from a more reputable source.
