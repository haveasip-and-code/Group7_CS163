gorper
Any person whose life is defined by outdoor activities such as backpacking or camping. They often sport goatees, flannel, shirts and sandals, and embrace environmental activism. The term is derived from the root 'gorp', the mix of nuts, grains, and dried fruits popularly brought along as victuals on the trail.
