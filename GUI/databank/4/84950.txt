reiki
1. (noun) The energy channelled by Reiki practitioners. ; 2. (verb) A process of passively channelling the basic energy that underlies material existence (somewhat comparable to the concepts of [chi] and [prana]) into a recipient or recipients to facilitate their self-healing and wellbeing. ; Reiki is distinguished from other healing energy techniques because practitioners are taught through a ritualistic attunement process involving [supernatural] entities, and because the energy has its own intelligence. ; Modern Reiki was developed in Japan by a man called Mikao Usui, but its true origins have been clouded by politics and religious bigotry.
