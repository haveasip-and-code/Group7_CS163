dad gum
Modification of the term [god damn]. Comes from the midwest, as near as I can tell - my grandfather (an Illinois native) used to say it a lot. ; Note the term is always used as an adjective, and NEVER as a verb. So you can have (day) a dad gum toll booth attendant, but you don't dad gum the toll booth attendant. The only exception to this rule is that 'Dad gummit' is a suitable substitute for 'goddammit'
