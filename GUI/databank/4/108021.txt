omnivore
Primarily, a living creature who consumes meat - i.e.: poultry, pork, beef, fish. Many human meat-eaters are disrespectful towards those who don't eat meat, particularly towards vegans, often writing bad definitions of them in urban dictionary. Such people are often bad at spelling and consistently illogical in their responses to vegetarians and vegans.
