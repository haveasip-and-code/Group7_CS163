copy paste victim
A victim of a widely-spread error: A computer user intends to use an original document as a template, copies it into the Windows clipboard, pastes it into a new document and does the changes. The user, however, does the changes in such a sloven way that the new text still contains numerous elements of the original one, and therefore blurring the intended meaning of the new text. The unmodified elements however should have been changed in order to make the text internally consistent. Copy paste victims often work under a strong pressure of time and can be found in all social classes.
