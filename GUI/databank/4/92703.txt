A nicer version of the dorms. This is where students go expecting more freedom from the dorms, only to be disappointed by a security force, second only to the KGB in fairness and Homer Simpson in intelligence. More rules here than at Grandma's house, except Grandma treated you more like an adult when you were 5 than the staff treats you now. More Ghetto people per square mile here than anywhere in Sactown.
