Stuart Hamm
A fantastic bassist. Most famous for being Joe Satriani's live bassist and for recordind with Steve vai, it is less well known that he has a solo career of his own and has produced the best albums ever [alongside Rush]. His style is a mix of slap and pop with some mad tapping bits thrown in, although he is arguably most famous as a bassist for his cover of Beethovens 'Moonlight Sonata'. ; He now has his own Fender signature bass, testament to his skill and contributions to music from the late 80's up until now. ; Also, has worked on two Rush tribute albums, as well as doing trio work with GHS. His trademark melody, feel and control are ever-present, and he is regarded rightly as one of the best bassists ever.
