wrapped up like a douche
as mentioned previously, it is one of the most commonly mishear lyrics. However, the song which this is misheard in is Mansfred Mann's version. It sounds exactly like douche even when you learn that it is deuce though. Bruce Springsteen originally wrote the song as 'cut loose like a deuce...' and sang it saying deuce not douche.
