euphemism
A word people use because they like deceiving themselves to believe we live in a Utopia. ; Mostly they're used by organizations and 'considerate' people who don't want to offend the 'situationally disturbed' citizens. ; George Carlin, a comedian, did a great schpiel about euphemisms once. (A few of the following examples are in his speech.) ; You should read it. It may not 'open your eyes,' but you'll realize how much we like to disguise our speech and blind ourselves. Disguising a condition with nicer, longer words doesn't change the fact that you still have the condition. Sorry. ; (Note: Not all examples {e.g. black/white} are 'conditions' or negative at all}
