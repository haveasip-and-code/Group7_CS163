stockton college
#4 Liberal arts college in the nation, Harvard is #1...stockton is for lovers, we have Benny's and shoebies and some out of staters who God knows what they were thinking for paying this ridiculous out of state tuition, we have a bunch of tree hugging hippes and cops who are security guards with a gun instead of mase, they are all fat so if you need to get away...run into the vast Pine Barrons where you will more than likely get lost but you wont be locked up by Sto-Po...the girls are either sorority girls aka the fakest girls alive or they are wifed up by their boyfriend who goes to some other school in New jersey but still does a guy at stockton to make up for the absence of his 4 incher. We have gangsters and we have posers, we drink at the corner and 10 west and absegami high school girls make cameos on a regular occasion so they can go to HS the next day and tell the tale of the college ding a ling. Go here, we get sloppy and makeout and all of our frats are only a hop skip and a jump away, on a map
