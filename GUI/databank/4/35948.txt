Spawn Camper
In online games, and in FPSs especially, somebody hangs around near an enemy spawnpoint and kills players as soon as they appear, rendering them lame. ; Spawn camping is not to be confused with normal camping, which is a legitimate tactic, unless you are camping right on top of a powerful or lame weapon spawn point, in which case it is not a legitimate tactic and is called '[whoring]'.
