SOCOM pistol
Known to USSOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) as the Mark 23, Mod 0. It is the pistol of choice for U.S. Special Forces. It uses .45 ACP (automatic colt pistol, for those of you not in the know). It also comes with a Knights flash and sound supressor and a laser aiming module. It has a 150mm barrel(5.9 inches) and is capable of match-grade accuracy. It is not very popular with Special Forces, being that it is very large, rivaling a Desert Eagle in size.
