Interstate 35
A major interstate highway in the central United States. It runs from Duluth, Minnesota, to Laredo, Texas, connecting the cities of Minneapolis/St. Paul, Des Moines, Kansas City, Wichita, Oklahoma City, Dallas/Ft. Worth and San Antonio. It splits into I-35W and I-35E in the Minneapolis and Dallas areas. Not a scenic interstate, but few east of the Rocky Mountains truly are.
