wakeboarding
ITS NOT A SKI! gawd! the origin of wakeboarding comes from 'skurfing' which came from skiing and surfing combined. The style of the boar is closer to surfing and you are positioned more similar to a surfer rather then a skier. But the skiing part comes from the fact that you do have a boat towing you with a rope and handle, and that you have bindings. Wakeboards have many things that affect the board including, fins and whether you have them or not, the rocker (how far off the ground each side comes). The smaller the rocker the better the rider. Same with fins, no fins=difficult but no fins also=better rider. I for one have been wakeboarding since i was 10, and im 15 now.
