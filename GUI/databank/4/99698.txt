cornflake
A semi-rigid scab-like crust of nasal mucosa that is carefully dislodged from one's nose in a lateral plane in order to maximize the square area without disruption to the integrity of the piece. May contain hairs (curb-feeler cornflake) and sometimes dried blood (strawberry cornflake) or both (strawberry curb-feeler cornflake).
