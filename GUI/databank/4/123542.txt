Jason Priestley
Starred as Brandon Walsh in the popular TV series Beverly Hills, 90210. The series lasted for 10 (or so) years, starting in 1990, and was very popular, though it was made fun of by many, including some of its fans. ; Jason Priestley is very, VERY attractive, though I think he was at his peak when the show first started. He is into racing fast cars, and has had at least one serious accident doing so.
