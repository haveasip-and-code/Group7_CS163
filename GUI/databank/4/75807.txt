The Keeper
an alternative menstrual product - a small natural gum rubber cup worn internally to catch the menses. since it's only a receptacle, there's no chance of toxic shock; it can hold 1 fluid ounce (most women only bleed 2-4 oz total over the course of their period); it can be worn up to 12 hours; it lasts 10 years. it rules.
