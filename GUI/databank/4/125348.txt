hooped
Screwed. An uncomfortable situation. In a bad situation that seems to have no way out. Comes from one of two meanings: ; 1) To have figuratively taken it up the ass (the hoop). ; 2) railway terminology where new (additional) work orders were passed along to a train crew. The orders were printed on paper, tied with string, and held up high on the end of a pole. The string had a loop for the trainman to lean out of the window of a moving train and aim his arm through the loop (hoop) to get the orders.
