the area-in-limbo between northern upper township (palmora & beesleys point) and southern upper township (seaville/petersburg), new jersey. though borders often fluctuate, the best estimation of the gaza strip defines it as the area between butter and hope corson roads. both factions of the township have been grappling for control of the district for the better part of a decade.
