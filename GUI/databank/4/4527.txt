SEGA Dreamcast
The SEGA Dreamcast was one of the last successful launches in the history of SEGA. With the biggest launch library (USA) of 24 games at intial launch, it was also internet ready with games that meekly used it, but later on was used for gaming itself. Some games on it, if not most, were mere ports from the SEGA Saturn to the Dreamcast due to the death of the Saturn (Including Shenmue). To date, Dreamcast is still strong in many people's hearts, but because of bad decisions and lack of faith in their followers, SEGA decided to withdraw from the hardware biz.
