loadered
Loadered is the result of the combination of 'lite beers' and a [chipper] or two (a chipper being the East Coast word for butting out a cigarette when it's around half smoked, and saving the rest for later). ; Being loadered usually prevents one from watching their hockey highlights that they taped on the VCR, and makes it extremely dangerous to drive their Toyota pick-up truck at top speed on the highway. (Please refer to local laws regarding maximum blood alcohol levels.)
