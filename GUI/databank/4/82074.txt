CD player
A mechanical device used to play music [CD]s. Recently, their numbers have been diminishing as the population of ipods and mp3 players grow. These digital music devices may be awesome, but CD players will always be a classic (but not a big of a classic as casset/tape players, because those are REALLY a classic when it comes to portable music devices). When used during school, teachers often take them up, even though there is scientific evidence that music aids in the learning process (i think).
