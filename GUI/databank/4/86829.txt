The greatest band to hail from UK since The Beatles who used to think they had to conquer [The Land Of The Fat] to attain super stardom until The Great Escape in 1995. They did score however with Song2, from Blur 1997 - that Woohoo song. By that time, success in [The Land Of The Fat] didnt really matter to them.
