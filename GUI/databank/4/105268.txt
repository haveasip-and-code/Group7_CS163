Stephen Lynch
Comedian who sings songs about things people don't think about all to often. Like hermaphrodites, men with one testicle, loving a dead body, being superheros, dead puppies, the short curly hair on the soap, grandfather dieing so you can get his inheritance, ugly babys, gynochologists, your dad catching you masterbating and much much more!
