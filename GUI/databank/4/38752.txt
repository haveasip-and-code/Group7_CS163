window
1) A sheet usually made of a clear material, such as glass, that is used to allow sight and occasional air flow, while otherwise retaining the characteristics of a wall. ; 2) When getting into a car, calling 'window' is required if there are more than four people. Usually, one person will call [shotgun], then the next two will quickly call window. Calling the window behind the driver is also wise, as the driver is usually closer to the wheel than the passanger, thus, more leg room. The person who hesitates the most ends up [bitch].
