The Danger Chode was born and raised in the bay area. He studied at the prestigious Antioch High School, the school that would forge his destiny. By day the Danger Chode attends Sacramento State, posing as an ordinary student named DC. By night the Danger Chode patrols the streets looking for women in need of partially satisfying sexual pleasure that only a Chode can provide.
