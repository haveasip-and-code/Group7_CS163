RoMicide
'Chomber commited RoMicide.' ; RoMicide describes the practice of banning anybody related to the CAD comic (Ctrl + Alt + Del) 'RoM incident', wherein some rather nasty rumours about the comic's artist were leaked, and in reaction, the artist deleted an entire subsection of the forum (Known as RoM, or Rantings of Madmen), and banned everybody involved. So, FalconX, a 'RoMite' created his own forum, where the banned 'RoMites' could hang out. Following this, everybody who mentions the incident or the URL for the new RoM forums are instantly 'permabanned' (permanent ban).
