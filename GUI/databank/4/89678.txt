Riverside High School
Home of the Beavers, RHS is situated on the Grand River in Painesville, Ohio (suburb of Cleveland). Riverside was built in the 50s and the school's colors are black and gold. Two rival gangs, the Face Cards and the High Rollers ('Dice' for short) fight for control of the halls each year.
