Drageon
Pronounced 'Dragon with an E,' this despicable, reclusive encrusted creature spends its days emitting sorrowful whines and irritable high-pitched gutteral grunts as it slithers about its domain scratching its scaly breasts. It derives its nourishment from its often lactating breasts caused by advanced gynecomastia. See [hutt]
