hope
'FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER, HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE'. ; When all is lost. You have lost everything. You are down and depressed and buried under ground mentally. The word that keeps you going 'HOPE'. Always hope for better things. Many people have told me hope can drive you insane...they can think what they want. I have found if you stay strong inside, you can get through anything.
