SMAQ
Stupid Marc Asks Questions ; This phrase is generally used to refer to any Marc who, on occasion, takes his time to correct a professor in a large, tired lecture hall. His objections are futile because in the end his tiny brain gets defeated by the years of experience the Professor has, henceforth no net benefit is given to the class, except for the complete waste of the student's valuable time. The resulting 'smaq' down by his fellow students is called 'SMAQ-ing'
