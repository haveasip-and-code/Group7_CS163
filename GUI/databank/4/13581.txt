northwestern lehigh school district
a hardly decent school in a little town north of allentown, its called New tripoli. most of the girls and some guys in NW can't live without drama so they flip out over the lamest shit. most of the people in NW are rednecks and/or farmers. NW doesnt even have a pool. and some of our parents parents went to our school in the same building. our school is almost next to a cornfield. our nickname:corn cob high
