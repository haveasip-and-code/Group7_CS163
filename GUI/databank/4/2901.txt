dragonlance
A truly shitty, pathetic, and semi-literate bunch of 'D&D' books that are more about marketing and cheap rp games than they are about REAL fanatasy. Fantasy cliches and horribly bad writing abound in this commercial wreck, I wouldn't read this crap if my life depended on it...If you want to read ; GOOD fantasy pick up George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series or Robin Hobbs books...And they ARENT D&D so all you n00bs can suck my dick.
