crips
A street gang in LA and rivals of The [Bloods], another LA gang. They like wearing blue. This is what is known to anyone outside of California. ; Apparently they do illegal stuff and frequently send their cronies to Urban Dictionary to 'represent', most likely to the dismay of their even partially literate members. ; At some point Quentin Tarantino has mentioned them on The Tonight Show. ; Famous rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg claims that that he keeps 'a blue flag' in his left back pocket, since that is the 'crip side'.
