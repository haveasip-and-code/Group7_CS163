krowz
Sea Cadet Non-Commissioned Officers without motivation, work ethic, leadership ability, or a low-fat diet. Often observed gathering in flocks. Usually spend unit drills napping on couches in a small cubicle referred to as the 'NCO Club' or 'Krowz' Nest.' Basic dietary needs include most menu items at the on-post McDonald's, usually in great quantity. Are generally despised by subordinates and adored by officers (i.e. their parents). Avoid at all costs, if you come across a krow, pick up a broom or swab and avoid eye contact, they usually will assume you are participating actively in cleansweep and will continue sleeping.
