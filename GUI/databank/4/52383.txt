taste of chaos tour
The Taste of Chaos tour is the winter version of the Vans Warped tour. although it is put on by the same people, it is nowhere near as good as warped tour. taste of chaos is mainly mainstream bands, such as the used and my chemical romance. the tour is justifed only by the fact that Underoath is playing on some of the dates. there are also some good, less mainstream bands that play on the acoustic and sponsored stages. otherwise, the tour is an excuse for mainstream kids to experience a mini-warped tour, with less moshing and intensity. if you want the real stuff, go to Vans.
