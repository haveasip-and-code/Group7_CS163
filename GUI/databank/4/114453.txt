laying a Mongo
once there was a terd so big it came above the rim of the toilet itself, it stayed for three days before someone managed to flush the bugger, we named it El Mongo, or The Don. Since then, any time anyone has gone to the big feeling that something big was gonna happen, it is refferred to as laying a Mongo.
