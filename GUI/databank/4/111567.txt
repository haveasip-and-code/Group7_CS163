woperchild
Wo-per-child ; Woperchild is the politically correct way to say woman. ; The reasoning is as follows: ; Wo-'man' is not ok because it has man in it. So you say, 'wo-person.' But you can't say per-'son' because son is too male dominant. So you say per-child. ; Hence, woperchild. Guaranteed not to offend even lesbian per-children of color.
