detroit tigers
Best Team to ever grace baseball as well as any other sport, won the world series 4x and participated in it 9 times, but has had one of the best records all time, in the lst decade they have not been fairing well to say the least but they showed they were on the rebound in '04, and should go far in '05, aka the pussycats when they are doing poorly,
