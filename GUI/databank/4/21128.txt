Gumpei Yokoi
Creator of the famed Game Boy and the not so highly thought of Virtual Boy. After the humiliation of the VB, he left Nintendo and worked with Bandai to create the Wonderswan. Sadly, he soon later died in 1997 from a car accident. He ended off poorly, but still left his mark on Nintendo and the world.
