Bret Easton Ellis
Modern-day author who wrote sharp, amusing, depressing and sometimes very disturbing satires about superficial people. Notable mention of books centered on cocaine-fueled rich kids in Los Angeles, A yuppie serial killer, a male model etc. He wrote; Less than Zero, The Rules of Attraction, American Psycho, The Informers and Glamorama. I wish he would write more.
