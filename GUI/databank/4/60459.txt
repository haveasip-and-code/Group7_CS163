chupacabra
also called 'the goat sucker' (Spanish=Chupar means 'to suck or to draw fluid;Cabra means 'goat'), el chupacabra was first sighted in Puerto Rico, draining the bodily fluid and some vital organs out of its victim's body. There are no or very little fight or fly wounds on the victims body, meaning that the creature might have telepathic powers. the only wounds on the victims body are two small puncture wounds around the neck area, like a vampire. Wittnesses say that the beast is 4-5 feet tall, have big, red eyes, spines running down its back, big hind legs, and possibly small wings for flight. ; from the first sighting, other sightings of el chupacabra have been sighted in chile, columbia, mexico as well as the U.S. and similar attacks in the U.K., Ireland and Spain. It almost seems that its going further north...so far, ONE human as been attacked by this mysterious beast (Watch Animal X on Animal Planet for more info), but no others. ; There are a few theories behind this creature. El Chupacabra is either a: ; 1)unidentified animal yet to be discovered ; 2)reinactment of ancient gargoyles (but i highly doubt it. seeing how gargoyles are a COMPLETELY different race) ; 3)alien species from a different planet ; 4)NASA experiment thats gone horribly wrong ; 5)occult.or gang activity trying to scare the public. ; what do YOU think?
