Subaru Technica International, its a Subaru Impreza that was created for the sport of Rally Racing, it does fairly well in teh WRC (World Rally Chanpionship). Unfortunaly since being imported to the U.S. people started decking them out, and ruining the good name of the sti, thousands of hours in the wind tunnel went into perfectly shaping the aerodynamic features of it, only for people to spend hundreds of dollars to 'improve' the aerodynamics, with more 'aggresive' parts.
