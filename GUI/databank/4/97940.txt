I Feel Sick
A two-issue comic series from [Jhonen Vasquez], focusing on Devi from [JTHM]'s struggles as a comic book artist against a wall of ignorant editors (probably reflecting Nickelodeon's attitude to [Invader Zim]) and her rather unfortunate lovelife. Also features a cameo from [Nny]. ; By the way, whisper it, it's his best (comic) work to date. Now go squeeze your Mister Spooky!
