blink182
-a band popular in the 90s ; -neo-punk (may be consider as pop punk or prep punk) ; -is commonly frowned upon by hardcore, punk, and classical rock fans ; -has a strong cult and following ; -is known for a voice that is slightly more high pitched voice than other punk bands, highly distorted guitar, very easy bass lines, and good drum lines. ; -known for being reckless and the usual hooligan teens ; -in my opinion, they are usually not given the credit they deserve because they are commonly not popular around teenage boys, and are dubbed 'gay' or 'bad music' by peer pressure.
