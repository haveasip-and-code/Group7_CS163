rissole
French in origin, a rissole is a small fried patty made with mincemeat and breadcrumbs. Often passed off as a delicacy by outrageously camp Kiwi chefs, a rissole is actually traditionally a peasant's food, and is still considered this in France. ; Typically the rissole is made up of leftovers and scraps left in the cupboards. Due to this rissole often leaves people with vicious gastrointestinal repercussions. This may include incidents of sharting.
