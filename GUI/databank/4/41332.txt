g4
A cable channel that is only available in a extra package, showing off the latest video games. ; History: ; Originally a sub par network ,the hosts are made up of young good looking people (most who are mostly really annoying and don't even play video games). The production quality of the shows are really bad, like something on a local access channel. There were a couple of good shows but, coming up with new episodes for them was slow, so you were doomed to watch the same episodes over and over again. ; The channel was owned by Comcast, which ranks up there on the evil scale with Disney and Microsoft. Comcast bought Tech TV (the greatest channel ever) and ruined all the shows by firing host who actually knew what they were doing and replacing them with host who... you guessed it look good, but are annoying as hell and no nothing about the subject of technology (a prime example would be Kevin Pereira). ; Comcast's plans were to reel in the huge amount of dedicated nerds who watch tech TV for hours every day. Instead almost 99% of the original fans of tech TV stopped watching the new hybrid channel known as 'g4techtv'. But for every tech TV fan who stopped watching the network, 1-3 preteens who knows a little as the hosts of the shows stared watching the network. The network would later be renamed back to g4. ; There was nothing that could be done to save tech TV, however there are still great tech shows like 'call for help 2.0' which are at g4's Canadian branch and internet show like 'the broken' and 'system' which have sprung up by former employs of tech TV. ; note: there is also a website for g4 which consists of a forum made up of dumb ass preteens who think they no about gameing and computers but really no jack shit. ; See: tech TV , g4, g4techtv
