BHEFA
BHEFA is an acronym for '[bible-humping] [evangelical]/[fundamentalist] [asshat]' This refers to the members of the [religious right]. The definition consists of several parts: 'bible-humping' refers to the love of the Bible by these individuals. If you love it so much, you might as well go all the way. The evangelical/fundamentalist part pays heed to the distinction between an [evangelical] and a [fundamentalist], which comprise the religious right. Finally, an asshat is an insult referring to someone who's head is stuck up his ass. This reflects the religious right's denial of the modern world.
