mezcal
A [Mexican] liquor that is close cousin to the more famous [Tequila]. Mezcal is usually stronger, and is known for it's trademark worm which is placed in the bottle. The worm's preservation in the bottle is, according to legend, a sign of high proof in the liquor. Many fraternities believe that eating the worm (which, unlike the liquid it's found in, is relatively harmless) is a right of passage. High quality brands of Mezcal rarely carry the worm.
