faggots and peas
Not a description of a [gay] [gangbang] involving [watersports], but a tasty meal, very popular in Wales, consisting of a large meatball (the faggot), served with processed peas (not too mushy!) and topped with a thin gravy. Typically served in a bowl and best enjoyed with a spoon to lap up the tasty juices. ; Very tasty fare to enjoy after a rugby game (there are still faggots and peas vendors in larger towns in Wales) but of course faggots and peas are also eaten at home. ; Sadly these traditional delights are becoming less common with the preponderance of standardised, homogenised fast food establishments such as McDonalds, Burger King and KFC.
