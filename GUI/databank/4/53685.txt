Whatemups?
A greeting like, 'what's up?' ; Started by Ben Sortino in 1998. It is a greeting by someone, usually muttered under their breath, as they are too cool to actually pronounce their words. If you make fun of them, their mobster father, Mossimo, will have you 'taken care of,' immediately after rigging the world cup.
