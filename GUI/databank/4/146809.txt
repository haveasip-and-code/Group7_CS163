Smith and Wesson M-76
A submachine gun produced by Smith and Wesson firearms during the Vietnam War for special operations and vehicle crew personnel. This submachinegun was chambered for 9 x19mmParabellum and its clip held 36 rounds. The main design of this submachine gun was based off of the Swedish 'Gustav M45' submachine gun which also was chambered for the 9 x19mmParabellum cartridge and also held 36 rounds in its clip. The Smith and Wesson M-76 was produced under request by the US government when supply for the Gustav M45 was cut off because the Swedish did not believe in the war effort. Several almost exact copies of the M-76 have been produced by MK Arms (the MK760 which is about 99.9% the exact same gun, internally and externally except for a few parts and the fact that two versions were made; one in 9mmpara like the M-76 and one in the larger .45ACP cartridge,) and a company known as Stemple which's more like 80% the same gun, most the differences are in external additions and like the MK760 has two versions one in 9mm and one in .45ACP.
