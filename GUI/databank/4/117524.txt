progressive breaks
Not really considered to be an official genre, and not really as much of a combination of the two genres (progressive house and breakbeat) as it is to destinguish itself from Breakbeat in it's Hip Hop influenced form - where more of the emphasis is on being funky. ; A Prog Breaks fan is more often a discerning listener and a thinker. Typical features of Prog Breaks include: ; > Tidily composed, cleverly arranged beats ; > A variety of texture (rough, smooth, sharp, flat) ; > Ingenuity and innovation in synthetic sound ; > A breakdown of some kind (for a few seconds), where the artist has let their creativity loose with upfront synth sounds or with a crazy, unpredictable bout of broken beats set to send your mind boggling. ; Notable artists include (but definately not restricted to) - Hybrid, Luke Chable, Phil K, Andy Page, Burufunk, Grayarea.
