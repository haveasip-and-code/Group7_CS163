The Doors
Late 60s/early 70s band fronted by Jim Morrison. Progressed from an amalgam of light and dark psychedelia to bluesy rock by the time of Jim Morrison's death. Known for Jim's voice and lyrics as well as their reliance on Ray Manzarek's organ; Jim's qualities stand out in longer tracks like 'The End' and 'When the Music's Over' as well as shorter tracks like 'The Crystal Ship' and 'Not to Touch the Earth.'
