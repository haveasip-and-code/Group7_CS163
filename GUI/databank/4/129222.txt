mmyes
'mmyes' originated at Lancaster University by a bear named Baz, made popular by many students of Fylde and Lonsdale. Sounding like the word 'immense' it is used to acknowledge agreement in or for something tender. It is an exclamation of excitement also, but is more than just a word, it is a feeling which becomes a way of life.
