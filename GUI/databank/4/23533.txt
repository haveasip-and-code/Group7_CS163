A school which completely and utterly saved me from the horrors of South East London's education system. ; The community feeling is like nothing I've ever known; sometimes I feel that the pupils there don't appreciate it as much as they could do - they should try my old school, then they'd realise how bloody lucky they are! ; Place where I reached the limits of my academic potential, which is more than I can say for my past experiences.
