freevibe
Government funded anti-drug advertisements that use things like rap and skateboarding in their commercials in order to appeal to teenagers. They also use black and hispanic kids in their ads because they're afraid of looking racist. Freevibe.com features alot of altered and completely false information about drugs, which is misleading and blatantly irresponsible.
