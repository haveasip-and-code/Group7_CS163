Demon Hunter
A hardcore christian metal band. The best in the genre. They're often compared to SlipKnot, but in all reality they're barely alike. Demon Hunter has talent. Sadly, we can't really say the same about SlipKnot. Demon Hunter never does interviews, and they're always very conservative of their identity, by wearing wigs, fake tattoos, ect. Their lyrics are usually quite brutal, and they abuse their instimunts.
