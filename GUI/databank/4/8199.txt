Coz
A penitentiary much like any other prison you might envision, except in this case, the inmate that calls the (Jell-o) shots is none other than Bill Cosby. Why the comedian/actor is behind bars is uncertain, what is known is that 'Coz' runs the pudding racket from the inside and uses this power of the creamy dessert to form an alliance with the Muslims and their 'main man, Zah-EEHDE-uh!' His addictions for the aforementioned Jell-o pudding and Coca-Cola, along with a weakness for Kodak film at times leave Cosby vulnerable to attack, but it has been 'Coz' himself that has dished out some of the most brutal acts you could possibly think of. ; Rumor has it that in response to a racial slur by a white inmate, Cosby downed an entire Jell-o pudding pop in one bite and stabbed the heckler in the lower torso, effectively murdering him by disembowelment. Another incident saw Cosby commit acts of sodomy on another inmate when the former 'Kids Say The Darndest Things' host discovered that that particular inmate had tried to move in on his turf and establish a separate pudding cartel. Suffice to say, if you like pudding and man-sex, you'll love... 'Coz.'
