Jandek
Jandek, the oblivious leader of a small internet Soulseek cult. Many people E-gather and raise their hands in the air to hail and worship Jandek their 'master'. Many people stare to the sky to let their master know their hailige is true. There is no Jesus, there is no God, there is only Jandek and his many, many wise LPs since 1978.
