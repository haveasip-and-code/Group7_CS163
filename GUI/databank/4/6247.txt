damageplan
kick ass speed metal band who is comprised of ex-Pantera bandmates and brothers Dimebag Darrel and Vinnie Paul. They are now hooked up w/ two flavor of the month bandmates and are poised to take the entire world by storm! I can see it now, Damageplan being as big, if not bigger than...dare I say it? Metallica? And with new material coming forth they...what? No way! You're fuckin' seroius? Dime? Dead? OMG, when?
