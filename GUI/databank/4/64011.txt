msn messenger
Msn messenger is an instant messaging service. NOT a [chatroom]. You can talk to your friends online and your friends only, unless you add someone to your [contacts list] that you do not know. Its a service that allows you to talk to your friends for free. So parents stop being paranoid...it is NOT and I will repeat NOT a chatroom!
