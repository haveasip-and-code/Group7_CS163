QQirl
Used generally on on-line, role-playing games, QQirl (the [QQ] meant to symbolize two crying eyes and [irl] a reference to 'in real life) is used to communicate that the player is 'crying in real life'. This is usually not the case, unless they have absolutely no life and have adopted on-line reality as their own. At that point, I should hope they seek professional help.
