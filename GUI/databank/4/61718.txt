GUIDO
The most vile people on earth. They most often live in New Jersey, Staten Island, or Brooklyn and come into New York for the purpose of crowding up clubs and being complete jackasses. Always wear at least a pound of grease in their hair, always have fake tans, walk around like they're big shit, and get drunk then try to pick fights with as many people as they can. ; Guidos and their ilk can be known to inhabit such Manhattan clubs as Exit, Lotus, and Avalon, as well as many pizzeria/diner in Coney Island or South Jersey.
