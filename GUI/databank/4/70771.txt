Hulk out
Whie originating with Marvel Comics loveable monster The Incredible Hulk, the term can also be universally applied to almost any character who undergoes a transformation that drastically upgrades his size, power and level of mass. Often, but not always, accompanied by damage to their clothing or an increased level of musculature. But a straight increase in overall body growth without any added muscle, or a sudden increase in various physical attributes such a womans breast size can also be considered 'Hulking out'.
