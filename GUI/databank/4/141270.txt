snomo
An individual who dresses in the lastest brightly colored snow vehicle attire. The snomo cannot handle extreme temperatures. This person may not actually own, ride, or have been in the pressence of an actual snowmobile, but that does not stop them from agressively attempting to resemble an actual snowmobilist.
