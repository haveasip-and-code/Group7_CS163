Generous old boll-weevil Democrat who praised John Kerry as an 'authentic national hero' and said that he was 'one of the party's best-known and greatest leaders-and a good friend' as well as asserting that 'John has worked to strengthen our military, reform public education, boost the economy and protect the environment' at a dinner in his home state of Georgia in the year 2001. Thanks for the kind words, Zell.
