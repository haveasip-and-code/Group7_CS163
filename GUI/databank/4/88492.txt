Peace Duke
New title given to George Bush by the Latvians; posters with his face and 'Welcome, Peace Duke!' were plastered all over the country during his recent visit. ; 'Peace Duke' sounds just like 'PIZDHUK' in Slavic languages, which is an obscenity that translates roughly to: ; -- Little Cunt ; -- Cunt-Lapper ; -- Cunt Dweller ; Sounds, and implies, something like the English 'Piss-ant' but much nastier!
