12 to the gallon
A slow, unproductive, lazy person, student or worker that will hinder a group or team from their objective. Basically saying someone is inefficient in terms of miles per gallon, because a car that gets 12 to the gallon is not worth driving, in turn a person that is slow is not worth choosing or working.
