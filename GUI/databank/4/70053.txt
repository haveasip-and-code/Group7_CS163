Big Mike
Usually a tall guy, can be fat, who loves to talk continously and most of the time is a basketball player. He is not always the best player, however, his size creates a balance with his overall skill. There are exceptions. I know of only four 'Big Mike's', therefore I am basing my opinion around what I know of them. Only one of them uses something other then size to take the lead in a basketball game
