abada
Invented by a group of potheads in the suburbs of upstate NEW YORK, the word encapsulates the entire phrase 'I need a cigarette' or 'Give me a cigarette' ; Not to be used in all situations, only when a cigarette is needed to the point where it is easier to blurt out something as nonsensical as abada than it is to politely ask someone for a cigarette.
