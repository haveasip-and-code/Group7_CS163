a blind man who is <in the canadian system anyways> protecting either the wrongly prosecuted or the clearly guilty but can only trust the truths or lies that are only words coming from the mouth of the prosecuted that might be false and either way cause suffering if the prosecuted wins or looses often bringing an image of a scummy person
