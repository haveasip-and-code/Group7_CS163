big y
A supermarket chain in Massachusetts and Connecticut which claims to provide 'world class service' and 'great deals'. Buy 1 get 2 free sales and 'rewards' coins get frugal thinking shoppers in the door, while charging out the ass for most products. While reaping the benefits of high prices, Big Y still manages to provide Wal-Mart level service and quality. Big Y CEO Don D'Amour once beat a cripple to death on the steps of a church with his own cane.
