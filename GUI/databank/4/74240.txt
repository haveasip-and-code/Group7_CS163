speed of light
the speed that light travels, nothing can go the speed of light except light. during a conversation my friend were having, if something on land traveled the speed of light (like a [MAC Cannon], the bullets mass would become so dense, it wouldn't move. If fired in the Vacuum of space, it would create a black hole in itself, pulling whatever came near it and porbably blowing it up.
