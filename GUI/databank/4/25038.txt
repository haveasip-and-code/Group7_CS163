Clusty
www.clusty.com ; An internet based search engine which is often promoted by computer experts for its speed, reliability, and level of service. While it is not necessarily as graphically attractive as some of the other search engines, it performs its job much better [though this can be argued] than most search engines currently in existence. ; To simplify, the difference between Clusty and <random search engine> is the same as the difference between Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. Nuff said.
