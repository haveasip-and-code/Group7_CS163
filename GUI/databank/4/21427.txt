peter frampton
A pretty good musician who gave us 'Baby I Love Your Way' and 'Show Me The Way' but who put his career in the shitter after he starred in the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band movie which sucked ass. Now he has to get his food at B.K. and not have it catered to him on a silver plate which he then throws away after he is done like the best guitarist of all time Eric Clapton
