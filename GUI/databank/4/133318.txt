black sheep bar
The Black Sheep Bar is a bar/club in South Croydon. It differs from the usual Croydon clubs in that it plays 'alternative' music, and stays open until 3am so all the pill-heads have somewhere to rave. Not to be thought of as merely a drug-haven, it also houses some live band nights, and occasionly films on a Monday night.
