doinkle
Noun: ; Used to describe the male member, aka 'penis' ; Currently thought to be coined on a game board after 'HybridX101' (me) became fed up with a users complex name and simply called him 'shpadoinkleboy' ; afterwards 'doinkle' had been used to describe an unknown part of the body until 'ekykens' another poster and part-time rival of 'Hybrid' drew the first doinkle looking oddly like a penis, thus the 'Doinkle' was reborn.
