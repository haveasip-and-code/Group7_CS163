Immortal technique
Best rapper from Harlem ever. Deff one of the best rappers of all time, its basiclly just him and tupac. Everyone else is around the same lvl. Both are influential rappers that move the shit out of there listeners. And both dont appeal to only one race like most other rappers. A white boi from the burbs and a nigga from the bronx can both listen to his song and agree/understand.
