Aiism
A philosophy (or sometimes religion) that has only one guideline: to love other creatures unconditionally. There is really nothing else to the religion. It needs nothing else, really. It is based on the idea that 'Love Is All You Need.' Aiists are accepting of everything, so many use Aiism as an extension to the religious group they belong to.
