bible
The bible, the most widely used form of propaganda and control in the world. The followers of the relegion are blindly following a god that punishes others for not following him...Example, 'hell'. Those who know of the crusades a long time ago know that this 'god' isnt exactly 'good'. What god would kill his own people just because they dont want to follow him? That doesnt sound like a god to me...that sounds like a tyrant and evil abomanation...But hell, no one has proved that god exists...and no one has disproved it either...All we can do is wait for the truth to come to us. And if he does exist and sends me to hell, i dont care because I WOULD RATHER LIVE LIFE THE WAY I WANT THAN TO BLINDLY FOLLOW A TYRANT...
