artichoke
A vegetable. A horrific vegetable. A tasteless horrific vegetable. An ugly looking tasteless horrific vegetable. A disgrace to vegetables, ugly looking tasteless horrific vegetable. A greenish disgrace to vegetables, ugly looking tasteless horrific vegetable. ; Historians say that this name was given to the vegetable in the far past. Back then, there was an unknown artist, who made really nice paintings. Everyone saw them, and recognized his work, but no one knew his name. One day, he was found dead, choked by a weird vegetable he tried to eat. Everyone mourned sadly for days, because Art had lost a great contributor... Thus, they decided that this plant is a choke to art and evidently, they came up with artichoke. ; Warning: Parents have the weird tendency to force their kids to eat it. Kids, avoid it at all costs. They don't know what they are telling you!
