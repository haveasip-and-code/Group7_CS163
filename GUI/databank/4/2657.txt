fruit salad
A song sung by [The Wiggles] which is sadly too easy to make fun of, due to the fact that we all can tell that all of them, even the pirate (or the butt pirate), are all gay. The fact that they sing this song basically sounds like they're singing about having a gay orgy, a.k.a. 'the fruit salad.'
