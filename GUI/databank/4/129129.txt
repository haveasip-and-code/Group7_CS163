Condelizza Rice
A woman who has high rankings on the political spectrum. Rice is well known for her great efforts to bring about peace around the world, along with fighting terrorism. Condelizza Rice is a lovable version of [George W Bush]. She is a possible canidate for president in 2008. Another possible canidate would be Hillary Clinton. ; If Rice was voted as president, not only would she be the first woman as president, but also the first person of color. It would show the world that America is in fact not racist, and could help America all away around. Compared to Clinton, Rice is far more moderate, with a slight taste of conservative. Clinton leaves that sour liberal taste that won't go away. ; You might think Clinton would be a great president since she is a woman. Well then, that's sexist. But if you want to think in that frame, Condelizza Rice would be a great president because she is a black woman. Vote Rice '08, vote for progression.
