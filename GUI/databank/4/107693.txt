An absolutely worthless music festival begun in the 90's by an irritating heroin addict. Never before were so many untalented smelly losers gathered in one place, then moved from city to city in a veritable caravan of human refuse. Thankfully this traveling sideshow lost it's steam and ended some years ago.
