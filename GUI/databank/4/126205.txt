1)As according to the wise Mr Arden of MB0406, 'FeFe' mean 'Free Frag'. It could also suggest that the subject is 'Weak' or 'NooB'. The term 'FeFe' is usually use to condescend someone whilst at the same time making the user, an asshole. ; (2) 'FeFe' is also the name of a team of wonderful people from the class MB0406 of Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Chemical and Life Science(Molecular biotechnilogy) faculty that clinch 3rd in a Captain's ball competition.
