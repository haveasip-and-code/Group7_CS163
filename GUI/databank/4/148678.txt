Neej
Neej is the definition of the name given to the one born in God's Nakshatra. Apart from impeccable looks, he's got style and an elegant class. He has a certain crowd of people he is with, and choses to be around. Having the 'PIMP STATUS' is just an inborn quality, but rewarded with equal amount of smartness, endurance, and intelligence is what goes with his personality.
