Mc mong
Mc mong, the greatest and reallest G in Korea, is also sex symbol of all korean bitches. His 1st solo album '180Degree' has been valued the greatest hiphop album in korea. After being released, This shit made all korean gottie boys 'wannabemong'. Above all thang, his rhyming skill is the shit. If ya listen to his representive shit, 'But I'm tha man', you'll be tha slave 4 him. I think that he is betta than Nas. If Nas is tha king of N.Y., Mc mong is tha king of Seoul. But Nas ain't no thang front of him:)
