forcus
Forcus was not only a supergroup for a short time on the MMORPG City of Heroes, but it was also a nine-year-old's attempt at spelling the word 'forces.' Scientists guess that 'forcus' is some kind of mystical ritual involving eating baby children, smoking lots of pot, and mixing magical herbs to ward away the undead.
