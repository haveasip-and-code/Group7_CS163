jokester who in literature or as in human history has been someone who had to act for his life to live to the becoming day.. ; If not been enough funny for the king/one-who-owns-him who didn't like jokester's performance anymore which means his act had got dull.. death would've been nearer than escape.... ; also look for [Bard] (in finnish u add just i to the end and u have finnish word of it)
