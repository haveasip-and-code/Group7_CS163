Altoids
Altoids are a series of candy and mints manufactured by Callard & Bowser (a UK company). The mints were originally sold in small rectangular tins with the tagline: 'Curiously Strong Mints.'After the mints became very popular, Altoids has now created a range of sour gum and sour mints. Altoids also has another drawing power: the packaging. Each packet of Altoids comes in a small tin or round tin all of which are designed in clever and pleasing ways. ; Also offering someone an Altoid, in some social circles is in fact an offer for them to partake in an act of oral sex!
