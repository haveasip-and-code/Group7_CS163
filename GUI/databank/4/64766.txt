providence
Home of the Italian mob (note the numerous 'Free Buddy Cianci!' shirts worn by college students in the city), Brown University (the ugly stepchild of the Ivy League- where you can graduate taking all classes pass/fail), RISD (which somehow managed to out-Brown Brown University), Providence College (where the kids their take more pride in their BAC than their GPA), Federal Hill (great Italian food- a good side benefit of the Italian mob), Providence Place Mall (funded by the mob, like everything else in this city), and lots and lots and lots of 'hood. There is no middle ground in Providence- you're either in a rich neighborhood or the projects. Oh, and waterfire is pretty cool.
