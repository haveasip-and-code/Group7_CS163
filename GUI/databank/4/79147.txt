Light Saber
A Jedi Knights weapon of choice the Light Saber is less clumbsy than a blaster, and is more of a symbol of honor, and wisdom than a weapon. A Light Saber\'s color depends upon the type of crystal put into the hilt during its building, and the crystal really depends on the Jedi\'s personality, and their particular alliance. Jedi\'s (the good guys) usually have stoic colors or softer colors which give off a prescence of being good such as blue, green, yellow, purple, etc. The Sith (the bad guys) more or less stick with one dominant color that gives off a presence of evil, red, dark red, crimson, take your pick. In closing Light Sabers kick ass, and I wish the government would go public with their mass production of the powerful sabers....Oh come on, we all know that its true...
