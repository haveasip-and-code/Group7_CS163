Lionel
Since the former Commodore's singer is a massive douche bag (especially because of horrendous song 'Dancing On The Ceiling' and his slutty daughter), 'Lionel' or 'Lionel Richie' is used as a substitute for a massive douche or tool bag. ; ALSO: 'Pulling a Lionel' can be referred to as doing something that a douche would.
