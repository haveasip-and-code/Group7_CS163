gang
A protective social circle that creates a community in neighborhoods whose 'normal' community-forming institutions have failed. Often found in inner cities and low-income areas, where schools are underfunded, parents cannot afford to pay for adequate childcare and must work long hours to make a living, and other youth organizations (sports teams, etc.) are lacking. ; A scapegoat for a city's problems. Government's excuse to glorify police and avoid confronting the real 'problem' in the inner city: underfunded schools and the criminalization of people of color.
