microcrap
See also [microshit] [microshaft] [microshafted] ; I thought it was supposed to be the other way around that companies were supposed to be the ones begging for ALPHA Version Testers.... But MicroCrap has millions and Millions of Happy Alpha Software testers who gladly pay through the nose to test MicroCraps Software and then put up with Spyware and Viruses and Crappy lame ass slow Patch development.
