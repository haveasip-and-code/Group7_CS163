macBeth
the most evil, bloddy, cursed and short plays ever written by [Shakespeare]. In the story, Lord MacBeth meets up with three witches who say he's going to be king of scotland. MacBeth decides to speed the process up a bit and kills the king of Scotland, King Duncan. As king he starts killing off anyone he fears until Duncan's son, Malcolm, and lord MacDuff form in army in England to overthrow MacBeth. In the end Malcolm becomes king, MacBeth's wife goes insane and kills herself and McDuff shows up on stage with MacBeth's head. The big thing is that the play is cursed and it's bad luck to say it in a theatre. Those who believe in the curse refer to it as 'The Scottish Play'.
