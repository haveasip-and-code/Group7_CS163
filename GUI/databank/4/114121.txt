Phylactery
Orginally, phylacteries come from Jewish lore, and are small leather boxes, containing strips of parchment inscribed with quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. Traditionally, a Jewish man will strap one to the forehead and the other to the left arm during morning worship, except on the Sabbath and holidays. ; Recently, phylactieries have been used in Dungeons and Dragons to describe the object in which a lich keeps its soul. This prevents the lich from staying killed and allows it to regenerate a few days after it was slain. In order to permenantly destroy a lich, the phylactery (which doesn't have to look like a small box) must be destroyed. ; J.K. Rowling also used this idea in 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,' but decided to refer to it as a [horcrux] for some reason.
