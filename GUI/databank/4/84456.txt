sodom
City destroyed by God in the Bible because people there liked to 'know' each other, but he saved some guy named Lot who tried to whore out his daughters, who were also saved and then later got their dad drunk and had sex with him to get pregnant. ; Read Genesis, this is true. ; Not to mention that even if 'to know' meant 'to have sexual intercourse,' the men of Sodom intended to RAPE Lot's angelic visitors. Rape, particularly gang rape, is an act of violence first and a sex act second; it is not the same as consensual intercourse between two adults.
