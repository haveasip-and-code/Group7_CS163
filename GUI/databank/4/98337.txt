Whitney Houston
Whitney Houston is one of the best singers ever in my opinion. Although now she's mostly known for her habits and frequent check-ins into rehab, in the '80s and '90s she was a very favored pop/R&B singer. She married R&B singer/rapper [Bobby Brown] in 1992, and in 1993 she gave birth to their only child, Bobbi Kristina Brown. ; She is widely known for her cover of the song 'I Will Always Love You,' which was originally performed by country star [Dolly Parton]. This song was featured in her box office smash movie, '[The Bodyguard].' ; In her career she has won numerous awards including: 6 Grammy Awards, 21 American Music Awards, 15 Billboard Music Awards, 11 NAACP Image Awards, 6 People's Choice awards, 7 Soul Train Music Awards, 5 World Music Awards, 2 Emmy Awards, the MTV Music Video Award and MTV Movie Award, a Cable ACE Award, the Dove (Gospel Music Association) Award, the Blockbuster Entertainment Award, and the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award. In 1995 she was inducted into the Soul Train Hall of Fame. In '96, Whitney was inducted into the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Hall of Fame and the BET Walk of Fame. In 1998, Soul Train gave the prestigious Quincy Jones Career Achievement award to Whitney, and in 2000, Whitney was honored to be named the Soul Train Music Award Female Artist of the Decade. ; Despite her bad rap with the media, she continues to be many people's favorite recording artist, and the reason is not rocket science to figure out. :-)
