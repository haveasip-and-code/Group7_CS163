Lacrosee
An ancient sport created by the Natives in North-America; back then it a game that was interpreted as sheer mayhem by the white-dudes. Nowadays, it is a nnational sport (the NLL) with ten teams across Canada and the US. There are also many college teams and high-school teams. It is lpayed in the spring by a variety of people, but they can mostly be summed up into two categories (most fall into a) ) ; a) guys who are too fast for football, too rough for hockey and too hetero-sexual for baseball ; b) guys who want hot [lacrosstitutes] ; Real men play this sport. And if you think lacrosse is for pussies, step into the box (or onto the field) with me for all of five minutes.
