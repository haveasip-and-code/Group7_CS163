twenteen
Essentially a replacement word for Twenty, however, this is more of a characteristic of defining the new 'kidult' age. Which is the age from 18 - 25, where people are staying at home longer, in order to obtain an education without moving out. Also used for people who continue to be a teenager well after their age has exceded the teenage years. This covers the ages from 20, through to 29 (twenteen-nine), as the age of 30 becomes thirteen, which is going backwards.
