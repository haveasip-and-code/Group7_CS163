Seattle
Seattle has it's ups and downs. ; Washington is a beautiful place and Seattle can be wonderful. There is so much to do there. It's home of the Pike Place Market, the Seattle Mariners, and Starbucks. Seattle is near so much. You have the mountains for snowboarding/skiing/hiking. You have the water for boating/swimming. You have everything you need in Seattle/Washington. ; The only problems are that Seattle has horrible traffic and it rains a lot. (Although, personally, I don't think the weather is THAT bad year-round.. and I live there.)
