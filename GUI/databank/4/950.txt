Aryan
An ancient Indo-European race that migrated to the areas of modern day Iran about 4000 years ago. They were caucasian. They looked like Germans. They called themselves the Noble, Master Race. They stayed in the areas of the modern day Iran. After centuries of evolution they were [white] anymore; they became tan and dark skinned, they got brown eyes and dark brown and black hair. Their Farsi got loans of words from surrounding languages, especially Arabic. They stopped calling themeselves Aryan, and began to use the more common [Iranian], or [Persian]. They created a huge empire; the [Persian Empire]. They spread so much that they began to genetically mix with other races (Greeks, ancient Hebrews, Arabs). During the Iranian Empire's power, ancient Jewish Hebrews settled in the areas of present day Iran, and they stayed, and over time they began to evolve into true Iranians. The Hebrews would mix with the Aryans as well. Persian Jews have been in Iran for about 2700 years. All this time the main Iranian religion was [Zoroastrianism]. But the Iranians that desended from the ancient Hebrews stayed Jewish, but they were true Iranians. (Once Christianity was a religion, it was pushed into Iran by the immigrating Christian Armenians later on.) Then, during the 7th century, Iran was invaded by the Muslim Arabs. More than half of the entire Iranian population was forced to convert to Islam; but quite a bit of Zoroastrians and Jews survived. There is a LOT to tell, but this is what the Aryans were. The modern day Iranians are mixed with Aryan AND Semitic blood. (The semitic ancestry was from the Arabs and Hebrews.) They are not white, but in the US they unfortunatly are classified as it, but a simple classification cannot change one's race. ; By the way, Iranian and Persian mean the EXACT SAME THING.
