Saudi Arabia
A 'holy kingdom' run by the corrupt Saudi family, who in 1922, boastfully named the land after themselves. ; Kicked out the Hashemite king who once owned their holy cities of Makkah (Mecca) and Medina. His descendant is the current King of Jordan. ; Saudi Arabia's main economy is oil production, which is very fortunate. All they have to do is sit back, pray to Allah to pump their oil, and millions of barrels are produced a day. ; A country that promotes oppression and hinders human rights. ; Full name: al-Mamlakah Arabiyah Assaudiyah
