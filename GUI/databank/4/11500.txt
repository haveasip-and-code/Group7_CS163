pigeon cow
The sacred and holiest idol known to man, with the head and wings of a pigeon, the body of a cow. The pigeon cow is the big brother of the [chicken cow], but unlike the chicken cow who comes out in the cold only to bite you on your ass, the pigeon cow will stubbornly stomp you into the pavement, take your wallet, and bill you child support for the next eighteen years.
