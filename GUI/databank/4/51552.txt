papa roach
A heavy rock/metal band that are quite frankly one of the best. They have songs about everything, not just cutting wrists and gouging out peoples eyes. Hell, I haven't met anyone that doesnt like Scars, and the Acoustic version just kicks ass. Oh...and they never perform in or around DC :(
