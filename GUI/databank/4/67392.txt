emo wannabe
Sad pathetic losers, who think they are [Emos] just because they made their parents buy them a pair of converses. They buy lots of albums such as [Taking Back Sunday]'s and make sure everybody knows, so that they appear to be and [emo] and to be included in the scene. however they still buy their clothes from mark one, and were [townie] jeans and tops and don't understand at all what they are getting into. they think they're really cool, but the people who really are [emo]s think they are sad and generally pity them.
