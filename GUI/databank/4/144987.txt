FAMF
N. meaning Fake Ass Mother Fucker ; or ; V. (when used with GA) a process, where by disrespecting someone in a certain way using very specific steps, is used to call someone out on their being a 'Fake Ass Mother Fucker'. ; (Similiar to the 'you're stuck wtih it' game, but more covert and fun. Also used competitivly to trick friends.) ; Steps to complete a (GA)FAMF: ; 1) Hone in on your target. ; 2) Say something to the target that catches them off guard and makes them say, 'What?' ; (Helpful Hint: A good trick is to mumble something semi-incoherent to them while they're in another conversation, or spout a fast string of non-related words in the form of a question. The idea is to be as creative as you can.) ; 3) Wait for the target to say, 'What?' ; (READ: Only the word 'What?' works. If they say something like 'huh?', or ignore you, you have failed your mission.) ; 4) Quickly shout 'GA FAMF!' ; (The GA stands for 'Gotcha!'. If you yell FAMF without the GA, it doesn't count, and you lose. If this happens, and the other person knows the rules of a FAMF, this is their time to rebutt with their own GAFAMF.) ; FAMFing can also work with text messaging and instant messaging.
