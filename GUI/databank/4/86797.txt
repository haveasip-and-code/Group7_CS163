Is this skit over?
Used when friends are discussing a comical situation that might occur and end up launching into a verbal skit about it. Each friend takes on the role of a character and offers up different comments that might be funny in the hypothetical situation, often taking on a different voice. These verbal skits often go on too long and are milked to death. Without breaking out of character, someone involved in the skit can end it by injecting 'Is this skit over?'
