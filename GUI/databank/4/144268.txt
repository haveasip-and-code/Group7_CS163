swova
Pronounced sw-OH-vuh ; 'Swova' is a convienient abbreviation of 'swear to Jehovah,' Jehovah being God. It can appear as a question or a statement, noun or verb. If someone makes a 'swova,' they are usually placing their credibility on the line, similar to 'swear to God.' If someone 'swovas' something and lies/is wrong, it is referred to as an invalid swova. A build-up of invalid swovas over a period of time leads to lack of credibility. You can also prove people wrong of their swovas. ; It can also be used to ask your friend if they would have sex with a girl you see. (see examples)
