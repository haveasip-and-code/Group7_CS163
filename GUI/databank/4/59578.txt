InuYasha
A so-so anime, dont get me wrong, the action scenes and caracter development(although slow) are rather well done, same thing goes for the look of each caracter(though, I be wondering if old Inu be compensating for 'something', what with that huge sword) Another good thing about it is the fan base, its large with mostly freindly (though....ummm....grammerless) people (Unless you offend there Inu-loving ways), Most of them watching out of curiocity(like I said, plot advancement slow, so your gonna wana watch it) with rather interesting music in it. ; (For those of you who like it, check out DBZ, Gungrave, and maybe even Read or Die) ; Though, the art style....it only got the necisary details in it, and it tends to be a wee bit lazy in shading, aswell as the dialouge is pretty bad(The voice acting is.....so-so), and Adult Swim has yet to show any new episodes(to my knowleage) in a REALLY long time.....
