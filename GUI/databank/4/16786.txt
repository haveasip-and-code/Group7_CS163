junkions
The Junkions, a race of junk robots. They are made of rusted scraps, chassis bits, manifold parts, and dented odds and ends. A little scatterbrained, they speak in odd-ryming, pieced-together sentences. Their words are a junkyard collection of broadcast fragments from T.V. commercials and radio jingles.
