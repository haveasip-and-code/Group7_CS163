malice
n. ; A synonym for: [melee] ; Originally defined as a term to describe hatred, spite, ill will, and so on, the term has gained a broadened definition since the advent of Microsoft's Halo. ; The term seemed to hold more meaning to some in terms of hitting or attacking up close as opposed to the much more common use of melee. Malice, for whatever reason, has been adopted to mean 'hit or beat.' ; Since Halo, this term's new meaning gradually began expanding to realms outside of Halo.
