Hooligan
Someone who worships the Great God Hoo, god of inebriation and Hawaiian shirts. ; Hooligans can be distinguished from hooligans by the fact that true Hooligans have nothing to do with soccer/football, and rarely get into fights because they're too busy drinking. ; Hooligans are more difficult to distinguish from regular alcoholics, but Hooligans often hold a job. For a while. And they wear Hawaiian shirts.
