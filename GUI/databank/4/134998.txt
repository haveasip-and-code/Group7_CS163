Mermaid
A legendary sea creature having the upper torso of a gorgeous woman and, from waist down, the tail of either: ; A. A whale ; B. A dolphin ; C. A fish ; or ; D. Any other sea creature. ; Mermaid sightings have been popular throughout the centuries. Some time ago in the 1800's, a fisherman reportedly caught sight of some sort of creature in the sea, having the upper torso of a woman with long brown hair and a white tail speckled with black. Around the 1890's, two women drying seaweed on the ocean shore found a childlike female creature naked and playing along the shores. Days later, the child's body was found washed up on shore. She looked to be about four years of age, with pale skin and a developed chest, and what looked to be a salmon's tail from the waist down. ; Mermaids have a very seductive nature, and almost always make love with sailors. No one knows they do this, but there is a theory that they are simply attempting to produce more of their species. When turned down on an offer of sex, though, the mermaid will be thrown into a fit of rage and slay the sailor who refused her pleasure. ; See: temptress
