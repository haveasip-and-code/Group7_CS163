emoprep
Someone who's clothing selection has elements of both the emo style and preppy style. They often have dark glasses, hair in their face, and wear bright striped polos and hollister minis. They are not average emo teens, they just like to be 'cool' and look like they have so many problems but cannot part with Hollister or Abercrombie.
