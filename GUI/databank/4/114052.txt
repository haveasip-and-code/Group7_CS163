wikisurfing
The act of going from one Wiki (such as Wikipedia, or Uncyclopedia) article to another. This sport can be highly entertaining and time-consuming. The vast amount of material covered, and the number of links within an article make it possible to jump (for example) from Monty Python to Vacuum Cleaners, and then to World War II.
