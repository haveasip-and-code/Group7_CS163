forgey
Forgey ; (n) ; A composite of the engish words '[Forum]', in relation to internet based community forums, and '[Orgy]', in relation to large sexual encounters with many people of either same of different sex. ; A forgey is normally what happens when a thread in a forum goes completely out of hand, and starts to branch into several, microcosmical coversations between isolated groups and couples. ; For a new member to the thread, a forgey can be a daunting challenge indeed, both to attempt to get the thread back on track, but also to figure out which part of the conversation they best begin. ; The word Forgey was first coined on the [Newgrounds] [Audio portal] [BBS], in relation to a member named Chronamut, and his activities on the said BBS. Chronamut is a homosexual proffesional music producer, and has declared it his personal job to 'gay the BBS up'. He is very popular, and drags a reasonable sized number of fans.
