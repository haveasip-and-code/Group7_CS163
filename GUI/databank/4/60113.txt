Portman
(v.) to render something that was long enjoyable completely unpleasureable. For example, Star Wars or the Shins. The term came into use in reference to the stylings of one Natalie Portman, a terrible actress that wiped her ass with the Legacy of Star Wars and ruined the Shins by offering their music up as a lifechanging experience in the film 'Garden State.'
