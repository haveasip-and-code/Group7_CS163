'Slow-down your shutter  your overlaoding me' ('Tsamtsem  ata lo ba-li tov' in Hebrew)
Originated from contemporary spoken Hebrew, it defines a situation where an agitated person, most probably with a splitting head-ache, hang-over or before his first morning cofee, is asking another to calm down, don't use verbose sentences, speak slower or not to overload his aching head with issues that requires listening, thinking or focusing. ; This phrase, originating from a leading Israeli comedy show, is well curved in contemporary spoken language and it means (in a free translation): - 'slow down your shutter, your 'homing in' on me in an overloading manner'. ; Gesture-aware people most often accompany this phrase with an overdramatic facial expression of a person abrupting his 1-hour sleep after having an awful hang-over, by some woody-allen style geek who lightens up the room and asking him if he read about the new star names EL-12141 reently discovered in our solar system.
