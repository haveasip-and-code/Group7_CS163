IBTL
'I Beat The Lock': IBTL is an acronym used on an internet forum when a poster has judged a thread to be due for locking by an administrator due to off-topic or offensive content. Use of IBTL is a declaration that the user has 'won a race' versus the forum administrator, who is about to close the thread.
