OK hard ass from north philly, you couldnt be more wrong. First of all, our school has been open for only four years, thats the number after three in case your stupid ass cant count, and we have won close to 20 league titles between our sports teams, and 5, count them, 5 state championships. Now let me do a little bit of math for your stupid north philly ass, thats about 5 league titles a year, and AT LEAST one state champ a year. Come down here to Council Rock, and who knows you may beat our asses up, after we fuck you up in a sporting event.
