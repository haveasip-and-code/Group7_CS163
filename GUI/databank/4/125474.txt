dazed and confused
The amazing Led Zeppelin song that later became the name for one of the greatest movies of all time. 'Dazed and Confused' is about several high schoolers on the last day of school in 1976. Set in Midland , Texas, the teens engage in extensive drug and alcohol use. Basically, that's all the movie is about.
