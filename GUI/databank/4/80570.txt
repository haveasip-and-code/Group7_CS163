speedhack
A Speedhack is a single program or a codestring packed into a multihack. It makes you move and attack faster. BUT: You need a fast Processor to get decent running/attacking speeds because the speeding depends on how fast your CPU is and it isn't helpful in Singleplayer games, because everything (enemies) gets faster. ; Speedhacks are commomly used in counterstrike to piss tarded CS players off. Those hacks are very rare in other games. ; If this hack is combined with an aimbot, it's the ultimate solution to ruin the average cs nerd's fun, ergo his complete life.
