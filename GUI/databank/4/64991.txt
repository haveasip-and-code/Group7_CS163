nog
Used when comunicating via text, usually in a 'live' situation (irc, IM etc), that you have heard, recieved or understood a statement or comment. ; Unlike replying 'cool' or similar, it does not infer that you agree or disagree or allocate it a positive or negative emotion, merely that you have noted it. ; Interchangable with 'nod', of which it is an intentional manipulation. ; Use of both nod and nog prevents spamming of one reply and immediately informs the person being replied to that the user is awake and listening, not just nodding dumbly. ; Nog replies can be used solely as an 'I understand' word in the form of 'noggle'. This is the inverse of 'boggle', where you do not.
