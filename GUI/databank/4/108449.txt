tourist town
A town with a relatively small population that seems to grow exponentially during the summer due to [tourists]. Usually located close to many major places of interest - to the tourists, naturally, as the locals have seen everything of interest at least 50 million times. More often than not, these tourists keep summer homes - they're too damn wussy to survive the rest of the year there.
