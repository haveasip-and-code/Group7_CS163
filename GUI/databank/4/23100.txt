pwnage
verb: A term used to express one's act or state of elite preformance. Pwnage stems from the word 'pwn' which is a typographical error of the word 'own'. The 'p' replaces the 'o' because during the frenzy of gaming, the player has no time to correct any spelling mistakes. This word is traditionally used by experienced videogamers, 'leet' speakers and others involved in computer minded social or work groups.
