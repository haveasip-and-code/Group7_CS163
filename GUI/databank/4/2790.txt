Moreno Valley
An over-populated town/city that mooches off every other county in its region. If any insults are directed towards Southern California, Moreno Valley is literally the scapegoat. I always have to describe it as 'a little more past Riverside.' ; Day Street is probably the only good place in Moreno Valley, but technically, Day Street is part of Riverside (city). ; That are actually half-million dollar homes here, but of course, nobody can afford them. The only people who buy them are buying them as secondary property.
