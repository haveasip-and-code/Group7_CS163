G-bomb
Letting a college student in the Washington, D.C. metro area know that you are a student at Georgetown University; therefore establishing your supreme authority and preeminence over the immediate surroundings. Dropping the G-bomb can be accomplished in many ways: Personal introductions, 'accidental' dropping of the Georgetown ID, or paying a tab with a 'jack the bulldog' visa card.
