logic
1. The governing force by which the universe is supposed to operate, but doesn't really. ; Non-operation is defined in the sense of a computer program having an error in its programming. Sense life has not crashed, we are forced to conclude that the universe operates. ; An extremely logical person will attempt to relate every event, emotion, and idea into a universal truth and will probably devote the entirety of their life to this endeavor, possibly to the point of obsession. When they fail utterly they can only say that they did the most logical thing possible. ; 2. An excuse to ignore the emotions, logic, ability, or worth of others in order to do whatever the hell one wants.
