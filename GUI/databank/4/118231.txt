-tsu
Suffix; no true meaning, though when added to practically anything, it's almost guaranteed to sound (more) Japanese. ; Use frequently with common '[otaku]' lingo and bad grammar, along with random Asian-sounding noises, and you'll sound genuinely [Wapanese]! ; Sounds best when used with a squeaky, annoying voice.
