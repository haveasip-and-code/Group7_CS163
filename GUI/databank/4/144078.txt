complainer
A type of person whose only way of speaking is through non stop complaining. We all know someone like this, and we all hate someone like this. Beware a complainer, because once they find a vent they won't let that person go until they are a complainer themselves. Ironically the first symptom of becoming a complainer is complaining about a complainer who complained to you about something so miniscule it could not even be called a complaint unless of course it comes out of a complainer's mouth. As you can see I really hate complainers, and actually by defining this I myself am becoming a complainer...OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!
