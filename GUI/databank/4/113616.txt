Status Clitical
From an anime called 'Gravion' in which it says 'Planetaly Defence System All Destroyed A Decased Citizen 10,000,000 STATUS CLITICAL!' ; The reason 'Planetary' and 'Critical' are misspelled is because in Japanese, R and L are the same things. This goes into other things such as 'Herro!' as some say to make fun of a Japanese person, or even 'Harro'. ; The real thing should say ; 'Planetary defense system has destroyed 10,000,000 citizens! Status Critical!'
