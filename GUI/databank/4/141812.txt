wankerphone
An instrument designed, thought up, or made by a wanker. In the same way the sousaphone was developed by John Philip Sousa. ; 1. A tuba designed for marching, designed in America. This instrument sits upon the left shoulder of the player with the bell facing forward, with the player reaching across their body to press down the valves. This instrument is, on the whole, useless. It was ocviously created by a wanker. ; 2. A trombone that uses, instead of a slide system, a valve system similar to that of the trumpet, French horn or tuba. A valved trombone's sound is reedy and jerky-sounding. Practically all professional trombonists wouldn't go near one, and it is the opinion of most sane trombonists that it was created by a wanker.
