Eagles
1. An excellent Rock band with many great hits, including 'Hotel California' and 'Life in the Fast Lane.' ; 2. Birds which are known for slow, steady flapping of wings. ; 3. An NFL football team from Philadelphia. Unfortunately, they have only made two superbowls (one of which has not been played at the time of writing this), but are currently one of the top teams in the league under the leadership of coach Andy Reid and quarterback Donovan McNabb. They had lost three NFC championships in a row, and have since been dubbed chokers. However, they have now made it over that hump and it seems that there are boundless oppertunities for this team. Only time will tell if they become a legend or a choking team.
