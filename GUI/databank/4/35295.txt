hollup
An idiot. Originated when a person was annoying their friend in maths class so said friend wrote a note to said annoyer. The note was meant to say 'Shut the hell up' but the friend's writing was so bad that the annoyer took the note as saying 'Shut the hollup'. Therefore the only two people who knew about this new word was the annoyer and the annoyee. It then bacame tradition for the annoyer to tell friends of the annoyee to tell the annoyee that she/he is a hollup, or vice versa. Fun for all the family.
