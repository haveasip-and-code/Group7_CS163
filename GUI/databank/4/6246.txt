homosexual
A male who is attracted to a male, or a female who is attracted to a female. Some people believe that people are born that way, and some people believe that homosexuals choose to be what they are. There is nothing wrong with them as a person, they are humans just like we are, they just have a different preference than you. If all the morons who think that they're 'socially adept' by walking around and screaming in everyone's face that 'God hates all homosexuals' and 'If you're a homosexual you can burn in hell', homosexuals would be accepted more in soceity. ; Besides, the whole main idea of [Christianity] is to have faith, but also to love and accept all people, regardless of their 'statistics'. However, the meaning of the religion is completely contradicted because they believe that apparently homosexuality is unacceptable and that marriage is only for [reproduction]. ; They, in no way, hinder the growth of children and population, as most of them adopt children which don't grow up to be homosexuals unless they originally had the gene. A person cannot intentionally 'make' another person homosexual, they are born with it and they did not choose to be it. ; They didn't choose to have to reveal it to the world and then to have 800 people on their backs telling them that they're [faggots] and will burn in hell. ; Oops, that's a sin, Christians. Insulting and hurting others.
