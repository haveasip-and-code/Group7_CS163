Ranger Beads
Also called 'pace beads,' 'SAS beads,' and other names. ; Beads put on a string that are held in place by friction, and can only be moved when slid up or down the string purposefully by the user. ; These have been used for centuries, now they are used by militaries and mountaineers to judge the distance they have hiked. ; *How to use* ; You have two sections, an 'upper' section with 6 beads, and a 'lower' section with 7 beads. ; You count roughly 60-70 paces, however many paces it takes for you to go 110 meters. Every 60-70 paces, drag a bead down from the lower section. Every lower bead represents 110 yards, or 1/16 of a mile, hiked. ; Every upper bead represents 880 yards, or 1/2 a mile. ; When you've brought down every lower bead and reach up to bring down the non-existent 8th bead, bring down an upper bead, and reset the lower beads. Start all this over. ; You can judge distance hiked over a flat surface to about a 10% error ratio. Remember if you're hiking over hills or something it'll mess this up.
