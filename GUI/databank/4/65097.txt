Daybreak
The best punk band regina has ever heard. Though if you are reading this you will never hear them and that's a dirty shame. The screaming by the front man Zac is unmatched, the guitaring by the Sean's are great, The bass by Jon(h) is sweet and the drumming by Jizz - amo is stellar. (Gotta live them drums).
