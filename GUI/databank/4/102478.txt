boycott
Word originated in County Mayo, Ireland where an English absentee landlord called Captain Boycott expected his tenants to harvest his crops as part of their rent. The tenants refused to deal with him and the word boycott was added to the English language. The landlord and his family were totally ignnored and their crops rotted without harvesting.
