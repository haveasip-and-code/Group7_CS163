LAN party
xbox lan party ; lan parties are just for computer nerds. I myself love lan parties because we can always bring our xboxes to other people's house. The main point of a lan party is the play games with your fellow friends. Some people perfer games such as Halo2 or NBA football, we all have different taste. Usually the games arent taken seriously and mainly have fun. ; pc lan parties ; It is where I bunch of people who bring there PC to other places and game together. Main games are counterstrike, Halo etc.
