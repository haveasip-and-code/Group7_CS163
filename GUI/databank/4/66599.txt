Notre Dame Girls
The definition of a notre dame girl is a rich dyke. They spend all day spending daddies money on things that villa girls get with a wink and a smile. Unfortunately for them they will forever live in the shadow of their ultimate predecessors villa maria. Villa is better in sports, academics and life. Recently takin by a poll of the Villa maria class of 05' they voted Notre dame their second favorite boys school...thats right they couldn't even win that competition. So in conclusion a word of advie for you notre dame dykes...money runs out but style never fades...VMA FOREVER!!!
