Sophoan
A Sophoan is someone who is male on the outside and [androgynous] on the inside. This is not to say they have feeling for members of the same sex, they are just unsure whether they are coming or going. ; Sophoans tend to have a talent for everything they touch and carry out everything they do with great dedication. ; Sophoans are dreamers who are prepared to go to extreme lengths to achieve the most extraordinary of ambitions. ; Sophoans tend to have so much to say that most of it goes over your head, but if you do manage to catch it then it is actually quite interesting. That is if they themself don't get lost in their own words!
