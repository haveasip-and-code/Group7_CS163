traf
the opposite of fart...in spelling. when you say traf, you think you're being so smart because no one knows that you actually mean FARRRRT!! So, you can pretend that you're a genius for while, until ppl search up what TRAF means on urbandictionary and find out that it actually means some sort of backwards fart with perhaps some sexual connotation...and begin to find you really creepy for saying earlier, 'man, this pudding smells like traf.' then a process which i like to call 'traf-ficking' beings by which all your friends find you too creepy to hang around and slowly but surly, you become obsolete, thin air, a faint memory. 'tis sad.
