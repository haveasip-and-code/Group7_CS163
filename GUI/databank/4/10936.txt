Jimmy Page
One of the great guitarists of all time, guitarist of Led Zeppelin, and don't go saying he sucks and is overrated, because he's quite the guitarist, but also don't go saying he is GOD, because you obviously havent heard Eddie Van Halen, Jimi Hendrix, or Eric Clapton, but i'd have to say Jimmy is right in the top 10 to 5 guitarists with them. O yea and don't forget Joe Walsh.
