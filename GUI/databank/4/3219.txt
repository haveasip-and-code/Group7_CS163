animals
A fabulous album, where Pink Floyd shows that it sometimes only takes five songs to be fucking amazing. It demonstrates different figures of society, which are described in the form of animals (sheep, dogs, and three different pigs). Listen to this album all the way through, i swear it will blow your mind.
