kvlt
Pronounced as '[cult]'. kvlt is a way in the blackmetal scene - amongst other scences in which the philosophy houses that if less people know the work of art you want/pretend to like because less people know it your penis is bigger, to say that a work of art is terrible obscure and to live under the believe that that automatically makes a work of art better. ; This philosphy is a stunning piece of reasoning and has kept me under the believe since I was 14 that the x-zillion types of unknown genres and obscure music I listen to is in fact better because it doesn't even sound like music anymore and it still works perfect. ; So get your kvltness today.
