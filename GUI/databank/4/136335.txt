scoatted
Completely, utterly, and totally inebriated to the point at which conciousness is a long forgotten sensation. One who is scoatted is unlikely to arise from their shameful slumber regardless of stimuli, be they photography flashes, a wet marker pen to the flesh, or even an early morning visit from the paramedics. ; Originates from ancient, Britonic folklore, in which tales are told of a brave warrior, cruelly slain by the evil wizard Tequilladon. The warrior's final words before his unsightly demise were 'T'ees it ovah'. The warrior's name was Scoatt, and he was scoatted. ; See also [campbell coma].
