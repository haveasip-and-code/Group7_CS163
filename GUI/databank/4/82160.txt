Get Off My Internet
Used when someone is so very retarded that they dont deserve to be on the internet, these people can usually be identified easily: ; 14 years of age, female, over use of 'lol'. ; 10-18 male, anime references, no regard to grammer, and no regard to spelling. ; Used to show superiority over the said retard, as in, I have more right to be on the internet than you do.
