Drum Set
A drum set is a configuration of different sized drums, generally consisting of a snare drum, bass drum, and three toms. ; There are two different set styles, the most common being the rock configuration. These have 12, 14, and 16 inch toms, usually a 22' bass drum, 14' snare, and 14' hi-hats. The other set-up is the fusion configuration. The toms are 10, 12, and 14 inches, the bass drum is usually 18', and hi-hats are generally 13 inches. ; The rock configuration uses the bigger and deeper toms for a more full effect, a taller bass drum for a more 'punchier' feel, and 14' hi-hats for a controlled splash. Some rock sets even have larger toms, so that there are 2 floor toms. ; Fusion sets, most commonly used for jazz, on the other hand, have smaller toms to create less of a punch, but the toms are only 2 inches apart from each other, so they are more uniform. The Smaller bass drum and hi-hats are used for a controlled, responsive feel. ; While drumming may just look like random smashing that takes no talent whatsoever, this is completely untrue. Drumming is in fact a talent, as it takes great co-ordination to have all four of your limbs doing different actions at once. Drummers also have to have great timing, since they are the driving force in a band's backbone.
