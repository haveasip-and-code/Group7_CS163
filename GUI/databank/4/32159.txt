enthusiastika
A very poor play on words, describing 'an enthusiastic Ka owner' (as in, Ford Ka). Despite conflicting reports, it is now accepted as being associated with the word Dervman, in so much as enthusiastika is a low-quality online magazine 'sponsored' by Dervman... that's 'sponsored' and not produced or published or promoted or contributed to by. ; Can often be heard being referred to as 'enthusiastikak' by those who have actually downloaded and managed to read through a whole issue. ; Given the poor content of the aforementioned item, it can only be a matter of time before the term becomes redundant, and hopefully consigned to the 'What was the point of that' wastebasket.
