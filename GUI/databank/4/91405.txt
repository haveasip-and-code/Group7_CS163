back logs
Shit that gets backed up in your colon and lower intestines as a result of neglecting your need to take a dump. Usually back logs are characterized by taking a dump, then about 10 minutes after you get off the toilet, you have to go back and take another dump that is roughly equal in size the first dump. Back logs are generally not healthy and are detrimental to regularity in your bowel movements.
