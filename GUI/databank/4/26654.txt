Upstate New York
upstate new york does not refer to the proximity of new york city; its the entire state in general. upstate is anything north of westchester county. ; The 5 bouroughs, nassau, suffolk and weschester are downstate. ; the only debate is westchester, not because of the social/economical connections with the city, its just that its north of the bronx. But most people say that it is downstate. ; if you think long island is upstate then you are obviously from one of the citys bad schools or from any upstate school (north of weschester). Learn your geography! This isnt that hard! Not one person I have ever met has even knew that this was a 'debate'(which its not).
