Eltrain
An extremely terrible rapper hailing from Schenectady, New York. The most notable highlights of his built-to-spill career were his ownership of a 1982 plymouth reliant, his only single that caught on ('Torn Away'), his horrid usage of the english language, and of course his recurring bouts of childlike behavior which resulted in his eventual loss of friends and ultimately, his social life in general.
