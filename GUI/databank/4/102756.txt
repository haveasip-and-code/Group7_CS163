walmarturd
a bland, generic corporate chain store, that's exactly the same no matter which one you go to, like [walmart]. each store of any such chain has exactly the same stuff in the same location, with asshole 20-something managers bossing over 50-something workers whose well paying manufacturing jobs were lost to China when Wal*mart told the manufacturer to make it there.
