Lagwagon
A punk rock band from Southern Califronia that maintains a strong melody and intellectual lyrics while still having a fat, fast, rock and roll sound. Kinda like the bastard son of NOFX and early Green Day, with the solid writing of Joey Cape.Formed in 1990 they have 7 albums on Fat Records, including the first ever release, Duh, in 1992.
