American Politics
An over-excessive proganda warfare in which supporters from one party (i.e. Democrats or Republicans) will try to convert others from the opposing party onto their side. This in turn upsets the opposing party and causes a similar reaction. ; In the end, the only one who truly benefits from such underhanded means of attempting to get into the office is the media. This includes, but is not limited to, both American, Foreign, and Alien news outlets.
