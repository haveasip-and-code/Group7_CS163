dangermouse
One of the illest producers out right now. He's mainly known for producing 'The Grey Album', but he has also laid down some hot tracks and solid production for the [Gorillaz] new album 'Demon Days'. He is currently working on a collabo with MF Doom called 'DangerDoom', which is some hot sh** and is being sponsored by Adult Swim.
