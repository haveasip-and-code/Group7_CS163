Oh Steven!
Created by an intelligent young man by the name of Ian (or Joe, I remember not) in the year 2003 or 2004. ; Originally used when talking to Steven when he did something silly. Morphed and took on a life of it's own, literally spread around the WGHS. Grew to be a exclamation that you can use in almost any situation, and even those situations where it would absolutely not fit. Can also talk about the clitoris.
