Head Mental
1. About as batshit insane as one can get without being locked in a padded room. One who is headmental acts in an erratic and unpredictable way, so much so that it isn't even funny. They are also observed to say things which blatantly aren't true and often hold grudges over the tiniest things. ; 2. The state your ex will enter approximately two weeks after impact.
