Cobber
Australian colloquialism meaning 'mate' or 'friend', but not necessarily in the literal term. Can be used to address a stranger in leiu of 'Hey, you there!' or 'Hey, kid!' in a more friendly manner. As the word's been used since the earliest Colonial settlements of Australia, many Aussies mistakenly believe the word is archaic and no-longer used. In actuality, it's simply slightly less understood then more generic forms of greeting (such as 'mate').
