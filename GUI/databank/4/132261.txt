bear bait
n. a vehicle (or vehicles) exceeding the speed limit in the [hammer lane], typically after a trucker has moved out of that vehicle's way. The expectation is that [smokey bear]s will go after the vehicle moving fastest, thus keeping them occupied with a [customer] when you go by. Sometimes truckers try to create this situation on purpose by blocking all the lanes of traffic for a period of time to make people behind them mad enough to speed. see [cop cleaner]
