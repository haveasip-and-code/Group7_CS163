avoca
Avoca, Pennsylvania. Home of the 1/2 mile Main Street that has not been updated since it was founded 120 years ago. You can go to the Barber...right next to the hair salon..that is right next to that nice old man with large ears who never stops sweeping the sidewalk. Colarusso's Pizza is the claim to fame...NOT Vince's or Antonio's. There are also more bars and churches crammed onto one half mile of pavement than you can shake a stick at. Bart's Clothing was the staple time capsule with the window display that wasn't updated since 1972...until someone burned it down...along with the Avoca Diner. The youth believe in desolation and fishnets and they flock to the neon lights and stained pavement of the Convienet like moths.
