unreal tournament 2003
Worst [Unreal Tournament] ever. Completely butchered the feel of the game, upset the weapon balance, and included a paltry number of maps and a bunch of useless gametypes. Unreal Tournament 2004 fixed all the wrongs done in UT2k3, but unfortunately wasn't able to woo back all the players alienated by UT2k3. ; Basically, UT2k3 showed off Unreal Engine 2's new graphics, while UT2k4 used those graphics to illustrate a game worthy of the Unreal Tournament series.
