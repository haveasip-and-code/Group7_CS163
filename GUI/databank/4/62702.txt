A book (the book was previously published as disco bloodbath) that tells the story of murder in club land. Michael Alig was the 'it' boy, the king of the club kids.He becomes a murderer when he kills his drug dealer. This is also a movie. The book, of course, is much more descpritive and in depth than the movie.
