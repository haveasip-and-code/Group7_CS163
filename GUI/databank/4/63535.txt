ADS
ADS stands for Alcohol & Drug Services. ; ADS is a bullshit program where they send teenagers who get caught smoking pot or drinking. During treatment they administer random urine screens and breathalyzers. There are three phases, phase one is drug education and it lasts for five weeks, phase two can be anywhere from 3-9 months long and they will keep you in this phase for as long as possible and ask you a bunch of pointless questions that you'll probably bullshit beacuse all you want to do is move onto phase three so you can be reassured that you'll be able smoke again within the next 4-6 weeks.(I only know of this program in the Northern Virginia area.)
