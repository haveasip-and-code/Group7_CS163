Patrick Stump is the sexy lead singer in the band Fall Out Boy. He can also play guitar. He has a hard time telling stories as you can see in the interviews on their website. He sometimes crosses the line trying to be funny but [Pete Wentz] is always close by to straighten that boy out. Like that [Buffalo Bill] joke. 'Wanna Slip Into Something More Comfortable?' Lol. FOB fans know what I mean. He's slimmed down a bit but he was sexy even before he did.
