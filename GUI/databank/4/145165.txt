GIXXER
Ultimate squid bike. Bought by people who think they'll look cool going down the road and leave 2.5' of chickenstrips on each side of the tires because they're too stupid to know how to lean over in a corner (or they're afraid of scratching up their knees since they're riding in shorts). Claimed to be 'the best' by pretentious assholes who have no idea what handling really is. Normally people like this go through 3 or 4 back tires while the front still has about 5000 more miles to go. Ditch that supersquid shit and get something good, like an MV Agusta, Ducati, Aprilia, or Triumph Daytona.
