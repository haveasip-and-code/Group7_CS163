Greebos
Well, on a shcool trip me and my friends had to teake off our braceletes because we were about to do archery. Yes me and my friends listen to rock music and may be rockers but we aren't how you all think we are rockers are cool. Me and my freind were saying how strange it looked without our bracelets on. I asked a boy who i know who was in our activity group if we looked strange without them. (we usaully wear them) and he said your a greebo! WE looked at eachother confused. What does that mean?! i asked him and he said greasy haired rocker! I was hurt by this, my hair is no way greasy. Later on, still on the trip a Chav *shudders* apparently called my friend this, i told her if he said that to her again tell him atleast we know how to dress (as you probaly know chavs have a bad dress sense) she laughed. But i dont agree with this atall. In my opinion it's just a word they made up because they dont like us. Can't see why though because we are really nice people and theres nothing wrong with us. (Chavs) are obviously jealous of us lol. So to me Greebo is a offensive word used against people such as rockers. Its rubbish. Associated with people who don't take pride in their appearance. But we do. Most people do! They seem to think this of (rockers) etc like they are anti social and dont care about the way they look.UNTRUE. I do all the time. But thats just my opionion of what this word greebo means from my experiances.
