Spanglai
A bastard combination of [English], [Spanish] and [French] spoken by confused high school students or people who just don't give a damn. Pronounced Spang-Glay, from the English word Spanish, and the French word Anglais (English). Differs from Spanglish by the inclusion of the official language of [cheese eating surrender monkeys]
