pop a roach
'Roach' is a slang term for marijuana; specifically, when one 'pops a roach,' it's when that person has finished smoking a 'blunt' (marijuana rolled up inside of a piece of paper in smokable form), and all that's left is the very end of it which is too short to smoke w/o burning oneself and too small too hold in the hand anyways (w/o a special pair of tweezers used for just that). So, this 'roach' is popped into the mouth, chewed up, and swallowed. ; A roach is prized b/c, after the blunt is smoked, it contains the highest amount of resin of any part of the blunt.
