andruw jones
Legendary outfielder for the atlanta braves. Yeah he won gold gloves and all that but what makes him a legend is his appearance in court during The Gold Club (atlanta strip club) scandal. Jones went to a party hosted by owner of the club, during said party Jones fucked two strippers in front of several people. Here's what happened when asked about it in court. ; Prosecutor: What were the women doing? ; Jones: Lesbian action ; Prosecutor: What did you do? ; Jones: Both of 'em. (With a look on his face that said 'What the fuck you think I did?')
