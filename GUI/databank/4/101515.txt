The King of Rad
The ruler and arbiter of all things [totally awesome]. ; The King of Rad's duties include determining what is and isn't [cool] at any given period of time, resolving differences in opinion regarding how [gnarly] an action may or may not be, accurately adjusting how [tubular] certain objects are and measuring how [righteous] any given situations is. Unfortuately, the inverse is also part of the obligation and although most are loath to do it, if something is indeed [sucky] it must be decried as such. ; The onus of being The King of Rad often overcomes those that hold the position. The responsibility can never truly be comprehended until it is experienced first hand. The current King of Rad has gone into hiding from his subjects, being unable to handle the barrage of suplicants. Widely known as Mr. Door (which may or may not be an alias) news of him occasionally surfaces on the [intertron], [interweb] and [webbernet]. The position cannot be abdicated, over taken or conferred to another and only passes on after the death of the current king. ; Due to his majesty's absence, stop gap measures have arisen in the populace to serve the [sweetness] rating needs. Some examples are the crude [awsome scale] and the very limited [Rad Scale]. The [Scale of Dinosaurs], though, is by and large considered to be the most [uber] due to the fact that dinosaurs are [kickass]. ; The highest rating The King of Rad can bestow is Totally [Rad] [to the Max]. The lowest is, of course, [teh suck].
