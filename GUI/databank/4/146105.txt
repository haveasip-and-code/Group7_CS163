HP/RW
Possibly the worst [Harry Potter] couple made in the history of [fanfiction]. HP/RW is short for [Harry Potter] [/] [Ron Weasley]. This is put in the story's summary to indicate that the characters come into a romantic situation together. Authors often use the excuse that these two characters 'are such good friends that they should end up together'. What ever tickles your fancy, I say.
