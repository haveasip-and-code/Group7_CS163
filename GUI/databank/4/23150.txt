LTC
An abbreviation for Latin Tag Crew, a Latino gang that has basically dissolved, and its members incorporated into gangs such as the Nortenos or Surenos. The whole concept of the gang was to establish safe community(s) for fellow LTC gang members to live and go about their business (selling weapons and drugs).
