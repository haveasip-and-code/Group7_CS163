Lenape
the only normal school in the whole district. we kick ass. our juniors build character walking a mile to school. our roaches can beat the crap out of your roaches. you all wish you had mary jane in the office. shes freakin awesome. we may be decrepid and old, but weve got pride. so you shawnee snobs can go play by yourself. you seneca people can go farm. you cherokee people can.....go away. why do you think the districts named after us? you probably dont even have a crew team.
