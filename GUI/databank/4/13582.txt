rocksteady
A legendary henchman of the 1980's who often made appearences in the highly acclaimed TV series, 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'. ; After a mutagenic ooze incident with a rhinocerous in 1983, half man/half animal, RockSteady, found employment under shredder in his brutal reign of terror and crime on the dirty streets of New York. ; What he lacked in IQ he made up for in strength and aggression and was rarely seen apart from best pal Bepop(Half Warthog). Underpaid and badly rewarded, together they worked to carry out Shredder and Krangs evil masterplan, often all too easily foiled by the Mutant Ninja Turtles. ; In retrospect many look back on the pair as a misunderstood and misguided duo who were manipulated by the much cleverer and meaner Shredder and Krang. Suffice it to say however, the NYPD did not feel the same way. ; From 1992 until 1999 RockSteady was incarcerated in Attica Correctional Facility for his involvement in Shredders crimes and in 1997 he was placed on the New York State Local Correctional Suicide Prevention Crisis Service Program for 8 months amid fear he may take his own life. ; Since his release he has reunited with [Bepop] and started afresh creating a new Reggae band who perform in Bars and clubs around the East Coast. Some may go as far to say, he defined the era.
