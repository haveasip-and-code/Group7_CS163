anime haters
hmm.. looks like we have another dumbass here. you seem to have a good arguement against people who are obsessed with anime, but you dont realize that you have no reason in your arguement to hate anime yourself. i guess you just proved that other guy right, you hate it because it is popular with the loser crowd, not becuse you think there's something wrong with anime. preps are fucking bastards, jocks too. i'm not saying i have anything against football becuase 'i was unable to join the team ', it's becuse i hate those egotistical dumbasses who think they're better than everyone else becuse they can throw a ball. and really, why would he want to join a team of ass-slapping, dumbasses just to get beat up? he would almost be a bigger dumbass than you by joining a team for the reason of getting beaten up. ; good luck with 'McDonalds'. i'm sure you definitely deserve to work in such a great facility as that if you can't even spell it. ; well i'm glad you're proud for you on that 1.5 'GPA', (rounding that off with a nice C+ in science for giving your teacher head but lowering that down with a D in grammar). yeah, nice little play you wrote too, it was about as entertaining as a 10 year old runnning the special olympics. and both of you are wrong on one thing, the stereotypical anime weakling geek and the anime-hating jock. i have a friend who likes anime, although not quite obsessed with it as others, and he has joined a football team and kicked plenty of ass. ; and why are you here on your computer anyways? itsn't it too 'nerdy' for you? shouldn't you be going out and slapping your friends asses and throwing around balls while your parents spoil you and bribe your teachers into giving you good grades so you can go the most snobby-est, most expensive college they could afford?
