starbucking
Yet another example of noun verbing, starbucking describes an action anciently known as 'going out for coffee'. ; The verb probably originates from some shopping-mall in Seattle, but is now widely used around the world, in the most diverse places, though almost always by college educated twenty somethings who are always broke but don't mind paying fortunes for useful things like coffee and white mp3 players.
