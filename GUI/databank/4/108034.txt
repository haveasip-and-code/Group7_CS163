e-bitch
a woman who is one of many on a mans msn list. likely not met in real life and just talk on the net. ; a man will likely have many many e-bitches on the go when he is single. ; an e-bitch is also affectionately known as an e-whore whereas a man may be an e-man or e-slag. however, the term bitch is interchangeable for man/woman. ; e-bitches are transient and once the lonely male finds a woman who will date a white skinned wide eyed IT support guy then the e-bitches will be dumped like hot potatos. ; if your really lucky your real life girlie will also have a net connection and can resume both the role of e-bitch and real life bed buddy! how could anything be more perfect? ; what could be more romantic than using msn to talk to your partner over your wireless network at home. sigh. heaven. ; hahahhaha hilarious.
