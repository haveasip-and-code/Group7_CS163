Mr. know it all
Someone who believes they've got the answer to every question even if the question hasn't been asked or if they really don't have the answer (... but of course they believe they do). This is not a shy individual, but rather someone whose ego is over flowing primarily through their mouth, but seems to have come from the other end of their digestive system.
