snakes
SOMEONE PLEASE POST A DEFINITION SAYING WHAT 'SNAKES' MEANS IN RAPS, LIKE PAPA ROACH'S 'got a problem with the snakes that are crawling/ through my area when the darkness is falling' and in GRAVEDIGGAZ' 'somebody oughta chop the heads off these snakes/ it'd be better off than dying in a pit full of snakes'
