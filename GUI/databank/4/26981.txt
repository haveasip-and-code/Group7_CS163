St. Benedict
SBS is a school of which the students cause so much drama it is stupid. People lying, backstabbing, flirting/makeing out with people they don't like, and ignoring the ones they do. This school has its fair share of retards, but also has some decent people. /Most/ of the are cool and you don't know it till it's too late. ; Saint Benedict might suck like heck now, but after you leave, you'll be wanting it back. You don't know what you've got until it's gone.
