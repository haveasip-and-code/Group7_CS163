LondonMet
'Hip' abbreviation of 'London Metropolitan University' recently adopted under its new image change drive. A byword for crippling bureaucracy as well as a focal point for no talent 'Meeja' student wannabes with Ipods and ironic t-shirts talking crap about Marxism while playing with their greasy ponytails.
