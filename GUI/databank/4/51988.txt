Someone from another country who has E.S.L and talks to you everytime you get on a internet messanger program, without even giving you time to blink. They often ask a lot of useless questions such as 'What time is there?', ' Do you go to school?', and 'What's the weather like there?' No matter how often they talk to you, their questions never seem to change.
