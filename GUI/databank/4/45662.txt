The bouncy flashy taskbar button feature
A 'feature' of Windows XP and a type of [Disobedient Computer Syndrome]. ; You can see a perfect example of this if you set the taskbar to autohide, and have say MSN Messenger running (and have disabled 'display alerts when a new message is recieved') ; Whenever a new message comes in, the taskbar button for it will flash (or at least remain highlighted) until you click on it. As well, the taskbar itself will pop-up and you cannot get it to autohide until that button stops flashing (ie, you click on it to see what it is). ; A *very* annoying feature as you might have several windows and programs running at once and may be focused on something which having to respond to a message (and seeing that bloddy button flashing like some attention craving person that refuses to wait for you and/or cannot understand that you're also doing other things and/or talking to other people) will break your concentration. Having busy or away mode will not stop this feature. ; Pop-up's on websites and other windows demanding attention will also do it. ; There is no apparent way to turn this feature off, making it one of the most aggrivating features in Windows XP.
