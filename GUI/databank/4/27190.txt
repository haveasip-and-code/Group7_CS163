lunchin
A word derived from the stoner-culture. It means to act stupid, or do something stupid. It also can mean to be [burnt], meaning you are slow or blank, because you're zoned or high. ; It is DEFINITELY regional! Me and my crew from DC used it religiously. Once I moved to Miami (and now other parts of Florida) people had NO CLUE what the word was. No one from down here has ever heard of it! ; See also: [lunch out] (verb or noun), [lunch box] (noun), [lunch]/[lunched] (verb)
