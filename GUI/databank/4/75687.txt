Telkom
A goverment supported Telecoms monopoly in South Africa, which at best charges 105% above the average wage for a inferior ADSL connection, $17991/m for a 1mb leased line and $1012 for 30GB of download data. Great profit at the expence of the poorly educated, inferior quality, bad service and dismal performance are their main products, these are products they plan to begin exporting to the rest of Africa in the near future. ; Someone should point out to George Bush that they are more dangerous than Iraqi WMD.
