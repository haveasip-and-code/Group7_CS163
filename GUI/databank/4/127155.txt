St. Catherine's
umm well whatever you people think is really screwd up. maybe it is your school that is like that. St.catherines is one of the most acadenically challenging schools around. MAybe you are burning it on urban dictionary because you did not have the brains to get in it. As for the St. Chris guys you are just pissed becuase none of them will go out with you. You can pathetically insult them now but when they have graduated from an ivy league school and you are passing out fries at Mcdonalds then we will see who are the stupid hores.
