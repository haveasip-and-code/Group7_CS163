bartholin gland
This is a small gland about the size of a kidney bean that sits above the [vulva] just before the [vagina]. It is responsible for producing vaginal fluids so that sexual intercourse is smooth and lubricated. Older women often have a faulty bartholins gland, hence they suffer from a dry vagina. The odour of the lubricating juice from the bartholins gland is often dependent on the womans diet, but in younger women the odour could be described as slightly fishy. [Red Heads] bartholin gland secretions are particularly pungent and [cunnilingus] is a very tasty affair with [Red Heads].
