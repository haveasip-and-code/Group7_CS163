bernards high school
the school that has 'new' carpeting (which smells like piss), doesnt have AC even though theres so damn man rich people in that town,has fights happening like everyother day, has drug deals going on in the middle of the hallway, has more minories then caucaisans,where richass kids pay for theyre lunch in nickles, and where you get anything stolen,where girls where fucking coach converses,where if you dont have a other brandname (aka LV) purse you are considered poor and uncool, and above all where almost any student can outsmart almost any teacher, and considering the IQ of most of the students, that IS saying something.
