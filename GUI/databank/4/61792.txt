pentagram
A five pointed star witha circle around it. These can either be pointing up or down, depending on religion. An upright star is used mainly by wicca, but it was also used as a christian symbol, in christianity its meaning is of the five scars of Jesus. One on each arm and leg and one on his side.The only band to my knowledge that uses this symbol is the hard rock band Godsmack. An inverted star is used in Satanism. It represents either pointing toward Hell or a goats head (depending on how you look at it.) Some heavy metal bands such as Slayer and the newer Drowning pool use this symbol.
