Atlanta
The most liberal progressive city in the South. The seat of Black economic, cultural and political power in America. Also the birthplace of crunk music/hip hop (Lil' Jon, Usher, Yin Yang Twins, Ludacris, T.I., Bonecrusher, Outkast, Goodie Mob, etc.) Also tied with Miami for the hottest nightclubs and girls in the South. Interracial dating haven. Kinky sex mecca for conventioners. ; Beautiful skyline. Almost total population migrated from somewhere else.
