James Dale Guckert
Better known as [Jeff Gannon], James Dale Guckert is yet another four flushing shill paid for by the [Republican party]. Guckert had been in a number of White House press briefings posing as a reporter for [Talon News] - a propaganda house for the party. He would come up with 'questions' that were always deferential and seemed to prop up Bush. ; Guckert had also advertised him self as a male [prostitute] on [gay] men escort services sites. ; This shows even more how dependant Republicans are on propaganda. That's because they cannot do anything right and need propaganda from [FOX News], talking heads like [Limbaugh], [Coulter], and [O'Reilly] as well as paid shills such as Guckert and Armstrong Williams.
