vianney high school
A Catholic Prep School in Kirkwood, Missouri that robs your parents of hard earned money. Intellectually devoid and often referred to as a 'daycare', a class period at Vianney usually includes looking at pornography and/or fantasy baseball or watching a shitty movie from the late 1990s. (Bonus points if it stars Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson).
