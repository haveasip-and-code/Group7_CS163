fingers-cut  megamachine!
Fingers Cut, megamachines (FCMM) is the project of Devon Williams, front man to Osker. Devon resorts back to a softer side of himself that could be felt in Idle Will Kill with tracks like patience. FCMM is a beautiful mix of folk rock and shows the best side of Devon Williams, with mellow acoustic guitar, bass and sleepish drums, Devon has really hinted on something great.
