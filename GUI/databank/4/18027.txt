The 90s
The greatest decade EVER! Disagree? Well, what did it give us: [SNES], [Megadrive] (Genesis for you guys in the states), the original [PSone]. Compare the cartoons & kids shows from the 90s to the crap we have now (old Power Rangers ruled, now look at the new ones). Heck, compare the leaders of the 90s to the ones now (yes, back in the day Tony Blair was actually popular, and Bill Clinton is a better leader that Bush). OK, some music from now is good (Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, etc), but the dance music was way better than it is now! It was a better decade for Michael Jackson (admit it, Dangerous, HIStory and Blood on the Dance Floor are good), Television (reality TV had only just started), Music (OK, if you don't count the Spice Girls, Peter Andre, etc. But we had MC Hammer!) and even politics and world events. But most importantly, it was the decade me and my generation spent out childhood in. Plus Bush JNR wasn't the president and Chavs didn't exist.
