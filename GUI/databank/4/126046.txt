Footloose bad
Old Gen-X adjective to describe a quality of music that makes it sound like something from the soundtrack of the movie '[Footloose].' ; Distinguishing features are keyboard whitewashes, fist-pumpingly over-the-top vocals in the chorus, and unmanly bouncing rythyms. In other words, sounding '80s in the bad way.
