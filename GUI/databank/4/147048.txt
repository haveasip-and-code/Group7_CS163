True Friend
A True Friend not only likes to hang out with you and [party] and have good times, but thinks about you when you're apart and [wishes] good things for you. A True Friend may not talk to you every day or even every week, but can [catch up] in a matter of minutes. A True Friend will come to your [aid], even when you haven't talked to them in weeks. Time doesn't lessen a True Friend's [affinity] for you. True Friends also are most [honest] with you, rather than [shining you on].
