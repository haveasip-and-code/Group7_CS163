scary-go-round
A delightful [webcomic] made by John Allison concerning the inhabitants of Tackleford, England, mainly the exploits of Shelley Winters (a kind, cute mayoral assistant) and Amy Chilton (a spoiled, selfish yet good-hearted art student). Escapades have included [zombies], anthropomorphic gas, Space Owl, [Jimi Hendrix]'s Devil Bear, the Portuguese Man-O-War, and many sprinklings of non sequitors as well as indie charm. http://www.scarygoround.com. Updates four days a week. Allison also makes T-shirts that put Urban Outfitters' to shame.
