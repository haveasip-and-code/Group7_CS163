wankersville
Not a reference to a place or vllage as the word may suggest, but a word used to describe an individual. It needs to be used without the indefinite article, i.e. someone cannot be 'A wankersville', but is simply 'Wankersville'. Similar to [Wanker], but is used when two syllables are simply not enough. A more elegant way to describe a wanker.
