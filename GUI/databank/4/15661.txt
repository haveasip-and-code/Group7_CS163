douchebaggery
1)The philosophy held by [douchebag]s, holding that no one other than themselves (or perhaps their close associates) matters in the least bit, and thus that other human beings can and should be treated like complete excrement for little or no reason (and often for selfish reasons). Closely related to [fascism], which has been practiced by [control freak]s such as Adolf Hitler. ; 2)The act of putting this philosophy into practice.
