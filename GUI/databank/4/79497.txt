Jersey Girls
The Jersey Girl mystique is hard to put into words. One would never say earthy-that's way too California. Gritty gets closer when you understand that a true Jersey Girl sleeps just fine with sand in the bed, but the definition still falls shorter than a pair of faded cutoffs. Jersey Girls go to the beach, or 'down the Shore' They're not formal. 'Casual attire' means shoes and bras optional. We have perfected the lost art of tanning, and know how to drive a traffic circle with attitude. We know good corn and tomatoes when we taste them, and we're never afraid to dance.
