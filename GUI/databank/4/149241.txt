Washington Beach
Historically known as an artist's haven, Washington Beach is the north campus area of Columbus, Ohio. Once designated as SoHu (because the area lies south of Hudson Avenue), the vast majority of Washington Beach real estate is comprised of rental property. The large student population in the area is generally less rowdy than what may be found a little further south. Parking can at times be a pain, however the Beach does not require parking permits or meter maids. Famous for its crime as well as its artistic residents, Washington Beach has also been referred to as the Vertical Slum. ; The origin of the Washington Beach moniker supposedly stems from the Grand Theft Auto video game. As legend has it... in the spring of 2003, Mike Carney and his roomate were joking about north campus. They were playing Grand Theft Auto a lot and started calling the hood, Washington Beach. This title was intended to bring pride to the citizens that live in north campus that have nothing to do with The Ohio State University, mostly kids not in school or attending CCAD. ; Geographically speaking, the boundaries of Washington Beach are Hudson Avenue to the north, Patterson to the south, Summit Street to the east, and High Street to the west. ; Subsidaries of Washington Beach include Baja Clintonville, Washington Grove, Washington Heights, and Washington Flats. ; Bands hailing from Washington Beach include 84 Nash, Tree Of Snakes, The Jive Turkeys, Times New Viking, Necropolis, Night of Pleasure and (little) neon wilderness. ; Famous sites within Washington Beach include The Dube, Bourbon Street, Taco Ninja, Inglesia de la Playa, Columbus Discount Records and The Spot.
