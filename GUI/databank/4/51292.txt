PolyDating
Dating activity with more than one person, or while being 'married' to another. PolyDating is a subset of [PolyAmory]. A primary component of this is that all parties are aware of all other parties. This is distinct from '[Cheating]' as that activity requires deception and concealment of other relationships.
