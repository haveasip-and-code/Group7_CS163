Poncey
The way in which a 'ponce' may act. The actions of a pompous tosser who thinks their value is higher than it is actually worth. The actions of one who thinks they are either overly stylish, cool or smart etc, when usually their IQ is akin to a fruit and they seem like a stunt double for one of the 'idiots' on the programme 'Nathan Barley'. Usually anyone with half a brain tends to laugh at these types, but unfortunately for society, this type of action is actually accepted amongst the 'Celeb' and 'Music' industry with open arms and is also worshipped. Oh well.
