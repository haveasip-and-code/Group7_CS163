1967-70
Music may consider these the most influential years in history. A little known Liverpool band hit big in the year 1963 with 'Love me do'. In 1967 The Beatles released the album '(Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band)' and through to 1970 they realised another 6 albums including the monumental 'White Album', one of the first double cd, single album. The last recorded Beatles album 'Abbey Road' is known all around the world. The influence of these 3 years could not be matched in a normal 300 years.
