Landslide
1. Back before the [Neocon]s hijacked the [Republicanazi] party, It it took an overwhelming majority of the votes to have a landslide, such as Reagan, who won 59% of the popular vote, and every state except Minnesota in 1984. Now, since 2000, a landslide is when you lose the popular vote and your hick brother 'Jeb' helps you to steal Florida and therefore steal the election. That's a landslide, and 2004 was also a landslide when you rig all the electronic voting machines and steal the election that way. [Republicanazi]s are getting good at landslides. ; 2. Prediction: [Republicanazi]s will make sure that electronic voting machines, built by [Republicanazi] supporters, will be installed in all 50 states. Then they can again have another landslide because they can rig the votes in all 50 states rather than just 30.
