Slave to the Grind
An awesome metal album by the band [Skid Row]. It was their second album as a band and the first metal album to debut at number one on the American charts. This album took the band from being a hair metal act to something way more heavy. Their singer [Sebastian Bach], however, was kicked out in the mid 9o's which is a shame because it put an end to an amazing act. ; Skid Row still tour but are nowhere near as good anymore.
