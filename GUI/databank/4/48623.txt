Bratz
A doll line by MGA Entertainment which first debuted in 2001 as a series of 9.5' girls; the line eventually extended to include Bratz Boyz, Bratz Babyz, Lil Bratz, Big Bratz, Petz, and more. Rather than the traditional doll roles of pink princesses and spoonfed ideas of stereotypical women's work, Bratz mainly reflect modern teenagers/young adults and the fashions they often wear.
