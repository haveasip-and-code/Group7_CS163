live action
Used to indentify an acted interpretation of an activity usually portrayed through animation. This phrase grew out of the trend of using adult [anime] (or [hentai]) to show types of pornography too physically challenging or obscene to show using normal pornography (for example pornography involving tentacles, popularised in 'La Blue Girl'). 'live action' attempts to recreate these activities with real actors and actresses.
