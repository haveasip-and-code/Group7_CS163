Salad Fingers
Mr. Salad Fingers is a precious lover of rusty spoons. He enjoys the pleasures of Nettles, yes, he enjoys them very much sir. Mr. Fingers likes to indulge in the delicacies that are his puppet mates. There will be fog on the shore tonight. Bossum. 'I.. I like it when the red water comes out...' --Mr. Salad Fingers. Some may call him distuuurrbed: but I love him. Love, Kate Stewart Baxter.
