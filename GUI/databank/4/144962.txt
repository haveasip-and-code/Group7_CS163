Kal Online
Kal Online is a free [MMORPG] developed by Inixsoft, a Korean based [game] company. It runs on the same game engine as [Lineage 2], and is very similar. It was released to international gamers around October of 2004. ; Inixsoft used their own home-made translator, and as a result, most of their English is horrid. However, the game was enjoyable without it. ; Around March of 2005, Kal Shop was released. It allowed people to buy special in-game items with real money. This sparked a massive amount of credit card fraud, and the game went downhill. People without lives turned Kal into their life, quitting their jobs just to play it. Memory string modifications and credit card fraud caused the economic system to deteroriate, and gameplay value went down as a result. To keep from being banned, people like a player named codon had family members do CCF for them. ; Kal Online is now a game full of [asshole]s and credit card frauders. Cookies to those who did their best to keep it good: Tsubasa, Synn, Aimen.
