Comfy Wumfy
Comfy Wumfies tend to be consistently cheerful people who insist--nay, demand--that the world be a 'nice place'. They enforce this belief by wearing T-shirts with kittens, or large, chunky, homemade sweaters. They believe in 'the environment', but can't be bothered to recycle. They eschew any movie/book/musical offering that they see as 'nasty'. They tend to move and mate in groups, forever having 'get togethers' where they can talk in a sort of sing song babytalk about how their boss is 'such a poo'. They praise Mac Computers, but only because their fellow granola eaters told them to. Sex with a Cumfy Wumfy is not advised, unless one likes rainbows, unicorns, or bad poetry.
