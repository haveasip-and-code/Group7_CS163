XDVandal
Two unique Individuals whom hailed from Henderson County, Illinois. These two convinced a entire county that a animal rights group was vandalizing a state park and various road signs. The letters 'XD' could be seen on nearly every stop sign on a back road in that county. While 'PWNS j00' could be seen on two bathroom walls. Apparently they meant, 'Anti-DeerHunting, Protect Wildlife Now!' ; Further investigation found it to simply be net slang. 'PWNing' the entire county.
