Old Whore's Diet
Day-old Chinese food, eaten first thing in the morning. The time of day matters less than the age of the food; the older, the better. ; From the Rufus Wainwright song, Old Whore's Diet, on the 'Want Two' album, 2005 - 'This song was from my rather decadent period. I'd been up for days and found myself eating some rather old Chinese food from a hotel refrigerator. I thought to myself that this is the ultimate old whore's diet.' --R. Wainwright, explaining Old Whore's Diet
