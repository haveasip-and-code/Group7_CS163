guerrilla gardening
If you understand [graffiti] as a ''[guerrilla] [art]' attempting to reclaim public space through clandestine and spontenous intervnetions of areseol on walls,' then you can easily make the jump to 'guerrilla gardening' as a parallel idea - replacing the 'areseol on walls' with 'seeds in soil.'
