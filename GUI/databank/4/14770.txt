muffy (muff)
1. used to describe one who is acting in a nerdy and/or uncool manner ie: acting not normal or weird ; 2. also can be used as an adjective to describe something that is not quite right ; 3. can also be interpreted as the hair around a womans vagina ; This definition of muffy originated back in 1997 when I was in high school. An un-popular girl at my school had a head of hair so poofy and frizzy it resembled a big muff on her head, so we started calling her muffy. The word slowly became an adjective, and started to replace other words in our vocabulary (ie: your hair is muffed instead of your hair is messed up, and what the muff, instead of what the fuck)
