nazipublican
A member (or sympathizer) of the republican cartel currently occupying the White House. Believe that the U.S. should be a one-party theorocracy. Radical christians, racists, misogynists, and greedy CEO's make up the bulk of the Nazipublican party. Their tactics of supression, intimidation, and fear closely match those of the third reich. They are a unified threat and must be destroyed.
