The ultimate killer of import and domestic rice. These are the cousins of Chevrolet's Camaro's. They use the F Body chassis. These are pure American Muscle cars. These were like the ricers of the 70's and 80's. Except the only difference was they had big engines, torque, and looks. But they were similar to rice in their affordable price, and who was driving them (teens).
