big hitter
The Man., One who is a straight up 'playa- playa'. One who cannot be touched. One who laughs inside at those who are unequal in the intellectual thought process. One who has a fat knot of cash in his pocket, or a fat accounts receivable with an extremely low day sales outstanding. One who can snap his fingers and have the world at his feet. One who can wine, dine, and 69. One who makes music that sounds like money. One who always have a big ole' stash of the best headies.
