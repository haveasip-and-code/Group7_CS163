reverse blade
A type of [katana], in which the sharpened side is on the inner curve as opposed to the original construction of a katana, where the sharp side is on the outer curve. That way, when battling, your opponent becomes incapacitated other than cut, lowering a risk of death. Fans of [Ruroni Kenshin] may have heard of it.
