st lukes
St Lukes is one of the best Private schools in Fairfield County. its student body consits of preppy and well off childern that are smart and talented at sports. The school uniform is for the ultimate prep (Khakis, Oxford or Polos, Ribbons belts, cableknit sweaters) The students that drive most likely have a Jeep or a cool Audi. The school is small with about 60 students per grade, and very exclusive to get into. The teachers are nothing but the best and have friendly relationships with the students. Everyone at st lukes is involved and loving their life:)
