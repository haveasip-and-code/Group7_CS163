do a Moby
When you have produced something original (music, an invention, whatever), to make a fortune by lisencing (NOT selling, see below) the rights to it to a big company that can bring it to the masses. Differs from being a [sell out], as you still own the rights, so the big co. can't force you to go [mainstream] to make them even more money. ; Originated when the [electronica] artist [Moby] sold the copywrites to every track on the album 'Play', for use in ads, films, and TV.
