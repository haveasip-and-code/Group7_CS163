fender rhodes
An addendum to my definition: CBS did not drop the Fender name in '69. That happened in '75. In '69, the silver-topped pianos, still bearing the Fender name, became the black-finished Mk 1 stage and suitcase series. Two very important years for Rhodes indeed. Then came the flat-topped Mk 2, etc. post-CBS. The last electric (tine/tuning fork) piano Rhodes produced was the Mk V in 1984.
