zaloy
Zaloy is a salad from a distant planet called Wemefarina. It is often served in fancy Wemefarina restaurants and in the shape of a peacock egg. It can be be found in the tropical areas of this planet, but the only way to get it is to go to the native cannibals of this area and ask them for one. They might give it to you, but they are very protective of their Zaloy. Zaloy can be cherry flavored, pineapple, fish, booger, strawberry, and flesh.
