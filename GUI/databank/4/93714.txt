Lesbos
This is a district under the government of a prefect (or prefecture) in Greece. It's made up of a number of islands in the Aegean Sea. ; According to Greek mythology, the god of the islands was called 'Lesbos.' ; An ancient poet called Sappho wrote about love between women about 2700 years ago and that's where we get the term 'lesbian' from. ; Apparently, Sappho's poetry was pretty hot stuff and the Christians didn't like it. Little of it remains today thanks to a policy of it being destroyed by those against it.
