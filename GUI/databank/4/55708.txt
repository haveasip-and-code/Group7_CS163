Michigan Wolverines
The team who beat ND 38-0 and Ohio State 35-21 in the same year. Chris Perry once had 51 carries and over 200 yards against in-state rival MSU. The team has went to the Rose Bowl the last two years and lost because of BS plays. The most winniest program in college football. The teams who's qb's go to win 3 superbowls. The team who has a freshman qb and RB that are two of the best players in the county. (Chad Henne and Mike Hart). The team to have the best player in college football (Braylen Edwards). Ohio State, great job this year, but how come you lost 4 games prior to beating us, including Northwestern. And we still went to the Rose Bowl.
