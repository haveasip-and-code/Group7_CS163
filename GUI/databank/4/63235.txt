doo
See Poo. Or, if one is too lazy to do such, 'Doo,' closely related to its cousin 'Poo,' is a more friendly form of recognizing anal leakage. Usually more solid in composition than its unpredictable cousin, it hardens upon contact with air and is immediately able to be used for a good game of feces-ball (similar rules to baseball).
