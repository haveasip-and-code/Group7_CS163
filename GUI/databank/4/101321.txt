chinese gold farmer
Originates from World of Warcraft, since people in China have like 8 people on one account, and they cant read the english in the game, they just mine gold for some reason, so everytime someone is found mining gold they are called a chinese gold farmer. ; Anyone who automatically accepts anything with yes, is also a chinese gold farmer.
