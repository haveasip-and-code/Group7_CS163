brit
It's strange that many (not all) americains seem to think that brits cannot spell the words HONOUR and COLOUR correctly, when it is the britsh that invented the language. Also I find it odd that some americains semm to think that the british dont brush their teeth. They should stop being so gullible as not all americains have what you would call a 'hollywood smile' with the types of food commonly eaten there.
