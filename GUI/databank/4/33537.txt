1. the worst thing in the world times 72.5 ; Background: ; one night when i was with my friends driving home we were playing a question game where you try to ask strange difficult to answer questions and one of my friends said would you rather be stuck in an elevator with a melon or a rustifer no one knew what a rustifer was so we all looked it up and found nothing so we finally decided it would be the worst thing in the world x72.5 (and yes we realize that it would never end) and that is how rustifer came in to being
