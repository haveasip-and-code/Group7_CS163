Emocore
The older harder version of [emo]. Emocore was what [emo] was called in the mid '80s when it was first started. Rites Of Spring was the first emocore band, but not many people knew about them. One of the members of Rites Of Spring joined Fugazi when it first started. Ian Mackaye, who was also the inventor of [Straight Edge], wanted to copy ROS's style, but make it more like [hardcore] so that more people agreed with it. After them came Jawbreaker, who widened emocore's by going more into modern and indie rock. Sunny Day Real Estate, who came out at around the same time as Jawbreaker, did the same.
