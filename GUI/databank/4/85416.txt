war corporatism
\'war 'cor`por`a'tis`m\ n. ; A new American movement led by U.S. weapons manufacturers, which has spawned a high-profile project known as the Project for the New American Century--a neo-conservative manifesto which includes in its toolbox the unbridled use of war in clearing a path for U.S. interests. President Bush is merely the figure-head of this dangerous precident.
