probing
Opposed to the primitive and brutal [trolling], probing is the martial arts of intellectual deconstruction of forum and chatroom activities, dominating in three categories:<br>1. Keeping a thread or discussion active as long as possible<br>2. Demonstrating opponents lack of intelligence through the use of irony, parody, sarcasm, information and wit<br>3. Making the whole thing entertaining to read for friends. ; When a probing session (that can take up to several weeks) is over, the page or conversation may be mirrored and published on a website for further public enjoyment.
