emily 'dutch'
the hippest foxcroft girl around. a totally awesome hound with her heart set on every woodberry alum... likes to dance in hallways to julio in the schoolyard and obsess over grey-sweatshirt-boy. has odd cravings for swedish fish and being organized. a true academic slut who just wants to sail on her boats she doodles in geometry class.
