sarah brightman
The ex-wife of [Andrew Lloyd-Webber] and the original Christine from [Phantom of the Opera]. ; Still a lovely lady, Sarah has carved quite a place for herself in [pop], [classical] music, and [crossover]. Among her hits have been [Con Te Partiro], with [Andrea Bocelli], whose career soared because of her (Andrea had limited success with Con Te Partiro, and Sarah was [enchant]ed when she heard him on the radio and she offered to record it with him as a [duet], which they did.). Her Albums include [Timeless]/Time To Say [Goodbye], [Eden], and La Luna. ; Truly an '[Angel] of [Music]', her multi-[octave] [crystalline] [soprano] graces her music and she often dances at her [concert]s, having taken dance/ballet for years. To top it off, she has [lavish] sets at her concerts. A true [artist], she could teach [Britney Spears] a whole slew of things... if Britney were smart enough to learn.
