The Sonics
A band from the Pacific Northwest, often shortchanged in history. They were the first band to actively try to distort the guitar, and attempt to be as loud as possible. For thier time they were relatively a-melodic. They released thier first album, 'Here Are The Sonics' in 1965. They released one more album, 'Boom' in 1966, and then broke up in 1968.
