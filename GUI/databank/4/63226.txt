Alternative Revolution
A music revolution that started in late 1991 and ended in the mid-90's (there is controversy over what exact year it ended). It was characterized by the rise of various music styles such as [Grunge] and [Industial], as well as the beginnings of [Pop-Punk]. This time period was also associated with the rise of Grunge fashion and the rising popularity of independent films (or films styled as independent films, such as Clerks). ; This revolution was, unfortunately, corrupted by corporate America, which took the elements of the Alternative Revolution, ironed them out, and sold to mainstream America. By the mid-90's, the revolution had become commercialized, ultimately resulting in the end of the revolution and the rise of corporate 'alternative radio' which is hardly alternative at all
