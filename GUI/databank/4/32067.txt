Oakwood
Some people view Oakwood negatively, they say we are a school full of ugly girls and hippies. People say that our school sucks, that we dont learn anything and are too busy doing drugs. Sadly enough this is all true. Oakwood does suck, it blows my huge gaping asshole. It is void of any intelligent life outside of this years senior class. It hurts me, it pains me to say I attend this school. Let me warn anyone interested in coming here, to stay far away. Let me also give a shoutout to Ellen Peters, our wonderful drunk dean. Three headed monster. Also let me add a big hello to mario. I hope he dies and someone steals his jacket off his corpse. I LOVE SUSPENSION
