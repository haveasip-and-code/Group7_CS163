malay lie
Malay lie: n. (1) A statment that is manifestly untrue, but one which the speaker nevertheless asserts is true. (2) A statement that one believes, on good grounds is untrue, but the speaker maintains is true. Proof that the statement was in fact a lie will only come after costly reliance is placed on it. (Origin: the word evolved amongst English speaker debaters following visits to Malaysia where daily life was made impossible thanks to the many lies encountered, hence the development of the 'Malay lie'.)
