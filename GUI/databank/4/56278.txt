Hobinator
Real Name: Marc Hobin ; The biggest queer in the history of queers. Quotes included to back up my argument: ; 'Teach me to hax.' (repeat over the course of two weeks) ; 'only woman hold grudes.' (two typos = fun for all) ; 'You're only capable of 'hacking', through freaking.' ; 'I have a life! I have two girls, who like me.' ('girls', eh?) ; 'You should hold the internet at ransom.' ; 'Make a program, that kills computers when you type 'hi'.' ; 'In case you didn't notice, I signed it as Dr. E. Jaculate.'
