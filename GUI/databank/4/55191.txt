cucuybird
The 3rd (pre-adolescent) stage of development in the life cycle of the cucuy. A winged, hummingbird-sized alien being found exclusively in the forests of central New Mexico, USA. The cucuybird feeds on insects as it gains strength before growing into the chupacabra, or adolescent-phase cucuy. When feeding, the cucuybird emits a high-pitched chirping sound much similar to sky-cars on the popular 80's children's cartoon, 'The Jetsons'.
