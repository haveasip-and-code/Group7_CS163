Los Gatos
Town in the base of Santa Cruz mountains, rich suburb of San Jose. Lots of rich dads with milf wives, and hot daughters. Lots of rich kids means lots of nice cars, big houses, and drugs. Overall tight ass place, a few hours from Tahoe, 20 minutes from Santa Cruz. Check out the Ferrari dealership, Hummer dealership, and huge houses.
