peroxide abuser
A person who is fake and insecure, has dyed hair, plastic finger nails, way too much make-up, talks too much, uneducated with no regard for the world. Spends lots of money but doesn't earn enough on their own. No sense of style. Chews and pops gum because it's the only way to get attention.
