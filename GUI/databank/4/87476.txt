Opel
European car manufacturer, pretty much the main branch of [GM] in Europe along with [Saab] and [Isuzu]. ; Also known as Vauxhall in the UK, Holden in Australia and Chevrolet in South America. (the Chevy models are slightly different, such as estate and saloon versions of the Corsa, which aren't available in Europe.) ; They make almost any type of car and is mainly aimed at the middle-class, along with Ford. Despite the shit reputation it seems to have on here, they do make some decent looking cars, such as the Vectra and their sports car, the VX220. They aren't rust-on-wheels anymore like they were 20 years ago. ; Some Opel cars also make it into America every now and again, such as the Sintra, a total failure of a people carrier in Europe but is doing remarkably well under three different brands in America.
