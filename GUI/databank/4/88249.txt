Yes
Besides its obvious literal meaning, Yes was a very very popular British progressive rock band, born in 1969 with the release of their first album, Yes. Famous members include Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Alan White, Bill Bruford and Rick Wakeman. Hit albums include Fragile, Relayer, Tales From Topographic Oceans, Going For the One, Time and a Word, and the disgustingly pop-themed (and hated by many Yes fans) 90125.
