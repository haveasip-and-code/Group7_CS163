gravemind
A huge plant like thing, made of a collection of [Flood]. many think that this actually controls the flood, but it isn't a fact. Graveminds form when the flood has been released on a planet (in this case [Delta Halo])for long enough, and is probably the collective minds of everything that is taken by the flood. the '[keyes blob]' from the original [halo] was probably an early gravemind. He tricked [John] ([Master Chief] for n00bs) and the [Arbitor], and took a ship to [High Charity]. In the end, he asks the rampant [Cortana]some questions. Cortana is such a whore.
