H.O.T
a korean boy group that debuted in 1996 with the popular record label SM Entertainment that have backed the artists: BoA, shinhwa, SES, Dong bang shin gi, and other successful artists. It was made up of 5 young korean boys. ; -Leader: Moon Heejun ; -Lead Singer: Kangta (Ahn Chilhyun) ; -Rap/Vocals: Tony Ahn ; -Rap/bg vocals: Jang Woohyuk (best dancer in the world ever!) ; -Rap/Vocals: Lee Jaewon ; They broke up in 2001 but everyone continues in the music business in korea today. Heejun and Kangta are both solo artists still with SM. Woohyuk, Jaewon, and Tony left SM, went to Yejeon Media, and started the group JTL together. All are also working currently on seperate projects, including Tony who just released his debut solo album. They had a really great unique sound. It was a mix of dance, rock, hiphop and classical music. It was beautiful in my opinion. On behalf of all of the H.O.T fans i can say that they are missed by us and one day we hope to see them reunited again one day.
