monkeybitten
Dark circles under a girls eyes. The term is derived from the girls looking sickly, therefore possibly bitten by a virus ridden monkey. There are a certain subset of guys who have a fetish for this look. Some may say they are 'smitten for the bitten'. This look can be achieved via makeup, lack of sleep, and heroin use. Also called MonkeyBites
