Molly McBender
A slang term given to an [MDMA] ([ecstasy]) binge. [Molly] is a slang term for pure [MDMA] powder, but it has sometimes been adapted to include pills, especially in the plural form (example: We just scored a bunch of [mollies]). The term 'Molly McBender' was derived as a play on 'Molly McButter,' the name of a butter substitute. These [bender]s can last anywhere from half of a day to a week or more.
