atari
Originally maker of coin-op video arcades followed by home arcade games and finally 8-bit computers such as the 400 and 800. After the advent of the IBM PC clones it came out with the ST series but they failed to catch on with businesses. Kept on going strong for years in Europe (Germany in particular) but finally went out of business.
