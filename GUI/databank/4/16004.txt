Gentleman of the road
A 'man of leasure' who spends his days rambling from one place to another,with a cheerful smile and a knapsack and stick over his shoulder,greeting people warmly and brightining up their lives. ; In the real world a lice ridden tramp with a can of [wife beater] in one hand and a HIV filled syringe in the other,pissing against your front door and shouting incoherrently at passers by .
