tank girl
A really amazing comic/graphic novel series about a hot punk girl with a bihawk who is in love with her tank also accompanied by a nerdy plane obsessed god named jet. Tank Girl goes on killing rampages and makes sweet love to a kangaroo-human. ; Also a movie .that i own. from 1995 where tank girl is played by lori petty. Although the tank girl is not portrayed quite the same in the movie as the comics. nevertheless an awesome movie with great flashes of comic based animation.
