oklahoma
A place fille with rednecks. It's pretty much Texas only smaller and with far less people. Iv'e been to most of the 50 states and Oklahoma isn't much different from any other central southern state, its got it's good and bad points, the bad being the rednecks, the good being you can get the best barbeque in the country there and in texas. People there need to recognize that they are country boys. I'm a New Yorker and even with NY's problems, I recognize that I am one, not deny it. same way that Californians are lazy liberals and need to recognize it. Oklahomans, if you want to be sophisticated city slickers, then move to Boston or NY or something!
