the Kids in the Hall
Awesome comedy sketch show from the early 90s. Best show out there for random and funny characters and scenes. Some popular characters from the Kids in the Hall include the Chicken Lady and the head-crushing guy. ; One very very excellent sketch from the show is the 'Daves I Know' song. ; If you haven't already, watch it. Right now. Go.
