Traveller's smile
The sign of someone who's fought a [traveller]. A scar caused by a pair of razorblades or Stanley knife blades concealed within a piece of cardboard. Since the skin tightens when cut, the two blades cause a nasty scar which sometimes never heals. It is often done down both sides of the face, so it forms a 'smile' shape, hence the name.
