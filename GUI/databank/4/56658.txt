Nhuber
A small curious creature that can consume 10 times its own weight in food. Has been known to release odd and ominous odors from its miniature carrying pouch; which is replaced with smaller and less useful carrying pouches throughout the lifetime of the creature (see also marsupial; marsupium). Can typically be found in temperature controlled, moderate to high foot traffic regions across Texas (ie- Houston Galleria).
