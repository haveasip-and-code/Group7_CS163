Ford Mustang
Facts: ; - Very powerful car and gas guzzler. ; - Severely overrated car that people give too much credit for. ; - A Mustang would smoke any economy car. But an economy car is designed and built for convenience. A Mustang is built for performance. ; - Usually being compared to completely different car classes. Such as economy cars like the Civic. The reason why people compared them to Civics is because Civics don't put up a challenge. People are usually afraid to compare the Mustang to the Camaro. ; - Drag and straight away racing car (No skill is really needed just pressing the gas, unlike drifting and cornering racing, skill of steering and shifting is required). ; - A car that has not so good handling and can easily be out maneuvered by cars such as the MR2, Impreza, Evo, Trueno, RX-7. Yeah that's right, you Mustang fanboys may have more power but any tuner import would out maneuver your over powered asses, you wouldn't stand a chance in a course with lots of turns.
