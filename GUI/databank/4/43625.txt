route 9
Similar to the bostonian application. A road that connects the rich, stuck up, Loudoun County, Virginia to the sad, poor, Jefferson County, West Virginia. The Wst Virginians believe that this road belongs to them and want Virginia to expand it to Four lanes all the way to Washington D.C. The situation will neverr be fixed untill Jefferson county adopts some zoning laws, thus pushing the speeding, drunk driving, pedestrian slaughtering hicks deeper into coal territory. Or until Loudoun county requires teachers to teach in the state they live in.
