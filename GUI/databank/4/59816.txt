Hood Rich
1. Hood Rich is sacrifing things you NEED in order to afford/or at least look like you can afford things you WANT. Typical of lower-income society. ; 2. Projecting an image of success or power that you really have not attained by showing off material goods such as cars or houses in an effort to impress those around you. In the end...in the 'real world' you're still a joke.
