David Gilmour
The extremely talented guitarist from Pink Floyd, who is often overlooked despite his awesome playing. Some of his best works can be heard in the songs 'Comfortably Numb', 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond', 'Dogs', and 'Echoes'. His style of playing isn't as fast as some of the other guitar greats but he is one of the most passionate players, as can be seen at live concerts.
