Ropey
To be a little bit toey, a little on edge perhaps even horny - generally brought on by fluourescent corporate chicken shed work cubicle lifestyle - doing that 9 to 5 thing with a rod up your back and just wanting to break free or sedate with drugs - the state of frustration!!! Often associated with upcoming corporate outfits with poor work culture and no feng shui.
