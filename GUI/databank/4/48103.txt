Fuzzy Bunnies
The Fuzzy Bunnies are the most hardcore motha fuckin gang out on the streets nigga! The members include Skeetacus, Lycrus, Kuntacus, Bitchicus, and Mexicanicus. There was formerly a member by the name of Bukakus, but he is no longer a Fuzzy Bunny. They have the best and most original hand shake in the world. ; The Bunnies were first made by three guys named Stevo, Adam, and Joe. After the ate at Onami's, they went into the Escondido mall and was afraid of being jumped by other gangs. Then there was a big discussion of wheather they should make a gang of their own. When they agreed on the gang they had to agree on a gang name. Adam came up with Fuzzy Bunnies. He came up with this name because if some gangs were to try and fight the, they would be flashing our gang signs and yelling 'Fuzzy Bunnies fo life nigga!' ; people would underestimate the extreme powerful force of the Bunnies. And once they ass get whooped, they would have to explain who they got their asses whooped by. Joe and Steve thought it was an excelent idea. Once they returned to Murrieta, recruited Fuzzy Bunnies into the gang. Recently connected to the FBs is a gang called the Fuzzy Mammas or the 'Fallopians.' They are the girlfriends of Lycrus, Kunticus and Mexicanicus. They have already got hand gestures to 'represent' who they run with. Fuzzy Bunnies fo life nigga! 'Prrrrrrrrrrr...'
