Teen Titans
A horrible show that has gained popularity thanks to the fact that Robin is part of the cast. This show has a horrible script for it contains a large amount of cheese, stupid dialoge, flawed plots and horrible character development. It also has awful characters that the audience can't connect with. Finally, the theme song of this show is the worst J-Pop I have ever heard. It should not be watched by anyone who has good taste in animation.
