wilt chamberlain
He was a great basketball player. Probally the greatest center of all time. He scored and rebounded with such ease. If he went up against Shaq some say he'd kill him some say Shaq would kill him. I think it'd be a good matchup but shaq might over power him. ANYWAYS he was a great basetball player but can never be compared to [Michael Jordan] for ; 1. they play completly differnt positions and had a completly differnt skill ; 2. jordans better :)
