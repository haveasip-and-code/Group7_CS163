Plaid Day
Plaid Day, May 18th, is the day where the sheer magnificence and general wonderfulness of plaid is celebrated around the world. Plaid Day is celebrated by wearing plaid on your person. Those who refuse to adorn themselves in the Sacred Flannel are duly sacrificed. Serious Plaidies indulge in tribal plaid face paint and the ceremonial burning of a kilt. Common phrases used on Plaid Day include, 'I'm plaid with that,' 'You're TOTALLY plaiding today,' and 'That's SO plaid.'
