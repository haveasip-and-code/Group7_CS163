Dighton
Pronounced: (/Die-ton/) ; A small town in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. With a population of 5,500+ Dighton is quickly growing. Students, and those of younger generations, are quick to denounce the town, as nothing but 'cows and woods/farmland'. Bordered by the towns of Berkley, Somerset, Swansea, Rehoboth, and Taunton, Dighton is only a short distance from 'the action'. Dighton is also situated near (Providence)Rhode Island.... :)
