The Tyger
The Tyger is a very sad individual. He surfs the internet looking for forums, typically of the bowling variety. He tries to use witty remarks to insult others for no apparent reason but has one fatal flaw: He's a freakin idiot. Others laugh when they see his 'insults', and feel pity that someone like this actually is out there. Numerous times has he been 'served', but either he is too incompetent to realize he had just been verbally bitch-slapped, or he realized that he's an idiot and decides to attempt a pathetic insult. The Tyger's hobbies include: picking on other's grammar then fucking up himself and saying 'Ah glad to see you caught my test' or some bullshit like that, criticizing any and all posts made in a forum for no reason at all, and trying to be e-cool, but ultimately failing and likely one day committing suicide. THe life of The Tyger is a sad one, but one can not help but snicker at such a stupid motherfucker.
