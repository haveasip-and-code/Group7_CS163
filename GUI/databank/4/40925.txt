habaschlaber
A degrating term used for people of a caucasion descent, with the offensive equivelent to white people as nigger is to African-Americans. The word originated when African slave holder would beat their white slaves in Africa. Habaschlaba and habaschlabro are slang terms for habaschlaber. It is alright for other white people to call each other habaschlabers, but it is absolutely not acceptable if people of African-American descent to say the word, because it is not acceptable for white people to say nigger.
