Originally developed as a temporary replacement, in the Anime-Heaven script of the Naruto 95-96 Special, for a line that no translation had been made of yet. ; YBAST was then made into the name of the editing group who worked for Anime Heaven at the time and later composed the majority of the [Dattebayo] Fan subbing group staff. YBAST is a 5 member (each assigned a letter) fan sub editing team.
