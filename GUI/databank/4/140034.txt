fair
According to most South-West Asians: Having a good, clear complexion. ; A fair-skinned person is considered attractive regardless of whether that person has a symmetrical face or a healthy figure. I've noticed that certain people who would not be considered attractive in the United States are considered beautiful here because of their light skin. The flipside is that some who are considered unattractive because of darker skin would be considered attractive in countries outside of India. The equation is simple: in India, light skin equals beauty. ; A single doctor who advertises himself as 'tall, dark and ; handsome' would get far more attention from women than ; a single writer who's 'tall, fair and unemployed.'
