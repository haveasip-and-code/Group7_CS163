Asian Studies
A course lecturing in the virtues of yellow supremacy, and the delusional outlook on how life would be if orientals had ruled the world. 'Asian Studies' majors are typically very whiny about the lack of opportunities of the socially inept Asian male, and the objectification and 'theft' of 'their women'. ; Exceptions from the stereotyped zipperhead students, are creepy white guys who have malnourished preteens chained at his kitchen to cook his meals, and 'culturally enlightened' folk who congregate together at StarBucks in order to agree on opening new coffee shop chains to preach their 'postmodernist' virtues.
