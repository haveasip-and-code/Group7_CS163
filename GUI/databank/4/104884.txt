Cows
1: A black and white mammal. The most popular source of milk. Some people eat cows, but there is a movement of people who go against this. These people are [vegetarians], and they don't eat ANY type of meat. There is also a movement of people who don't eat meat or anything produced from an animal (including cow milk), due to the amount of abuse the animals or the animals' children go through. For example, to get a cow to milk it must have babys, but the farmers want extra money and need more milk, so they kill the baby cows and sell their meat. ; 2: A [Sony] [fanboy]. These people like the {PS2] and [PSP] more then other systems. They tend to say negitive things about other consoles.
