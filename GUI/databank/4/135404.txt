Mozillatude
An attitude one might receive after questioning why an expected feature or function of a product or thing is either missing, broken, or implemented in a non user-friendly manner. ; Mozillatude often comes in the form of a question, thrown back in one's face: 'Why would you want to do that?' or 'If it bugs you, why don't you stop complaining and fix it yourself?' ; Term comes from the seemingly overly-prevalent attitude among those responsible for the development of [Mozilla]-family Internet products ([Firefox], [Thunderbird], Mozilla Suite), especially after an issue or complaint has been brought up.
