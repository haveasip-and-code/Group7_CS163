super chav
A super chav is a posh version of a normal chav but instead of fake designer labels, especially Burberry, they where the real version. This sub culture of the upper classes is often described as new money because their parents being hard working entrepreneurs have worked hard to build businesses/ drug empires so they could give their children every thing they couldn't have as a child, e.g. shoes. ; These young people believe that the impression that people have of you is all-important and the only way people can rate you is by what you wear, because of course in their world personality counts for nothing because none of then have one. ; The female version of this sub culture, more common than the male, will commonly be seen wearing Ugg boots, a tiny pink flannel Pineapple skirt/ track suit bottoms, and matching zip up top, with big bling belt, designer truckers cap, most likely pink, enormous hooped earrings and lashings of gold necklaces and rings all real of course, and obviously to top it all off a Burberry handbag and tinted sunglasses, worn at all times. ; The super chav herself will have straw like blond hair a very orangey fake tan fake nails and enough make up to sink a ship. She will persistently be talking loudly on a mobile, weather or not a person is on the other line is questionable. ; These people should be avoided as social contacts because they are unlikely to prove any use in the future as any kind of social contact, having wasted daddy's fortune on bling by the age of 25 and disappear to some council estate in Essex. ; Famous examples include Paris Hilton, their queen.
