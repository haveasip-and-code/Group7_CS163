the honda-tech
when a college stupid uses all his or her college loans to buy parts for their car. ; they often visit honda-tech.com and realize their car is not JDM standard. they then spend every single penny they have on $700 intake's that are no better then $20 filters and claim their car is 'hot' or 'sick' or even 'mad tight jdm yo'. ; when in reality they just wasted tons of fucking money.
