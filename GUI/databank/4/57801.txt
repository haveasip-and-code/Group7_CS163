Black Pride
A CULTURAL (not racial) celebration, which is the equivalent to Irish pride or German pride. This is because blacks in the United States are a Monolithic group with the same heritage, as none identify with any nation in Africa. Contrary to the belief of conservative and/or just idiotic whites, this is not racism since it refers to an ethnic group as opposed to a skin color.
