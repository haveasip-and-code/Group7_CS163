skipping the monkeys
'Skipping the monkeys' is a metaphor for skipping past the boring stuff to get to the good stuff. 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film begins with an instrumental overture that lasts about 5 minutes and then there's 15 minutes of, for lack of a better word, monkeys. I love 2001: A Space Odyssey and would never approve of fast forwarding through any part of the movie unless you've seen the movie many times and don't necessarily want to sit through a slow part to get to the good stuff. -Scott Moschella
