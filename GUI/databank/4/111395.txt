Abbie Hoffman
A revolutionary and member of the Yippie movement during the 60s and 70s. Wrote many controversial books (Steal This Book, Revolution For the Hell of It, among others) and was involved in many protests sometimes described as 'guerilla theater'. He was known for bringing the protests to the common man and making them interesting by using symbols and images instead of dull speaches and wordy pamphlets. Was iconified in Steal This Movie. May possibly be the greatest American in history, and the American equivalent to Che Guevarra. Everyone should learn about this guy and the movie is a great place to start. He's a hero.
