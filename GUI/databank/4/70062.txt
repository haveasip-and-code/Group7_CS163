Girls Aloud
An oxymoron if ever there was one - a Popstars/Pop Idol band that people gave a flying fuck about come their second album. Especially Louis Walsh, as he could (and should, lets be honest) retire on the money they roll in for him. ; Also seem to have been chosen for FHM centrefolds more than anything else: Cheryl has large breats (and a mean right hook, just ask that toilet attendant), Nicola has nice legs, Nicola is the obligitory ugly one...and I forgot which of the other two is which, but one has a nice ass, and the other is a good all rounder.
