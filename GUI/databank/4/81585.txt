third wheel
When in a group of three there is always the one that doesnt fit in. We consitter him/her as the '3rd wheel' because they just dont fit. If there is a couple together and then one of there cousins, it just doesnt make since for the cousin to be there. If there are two caucasian people standing with a black man, the black man is obvously the '3rd wheel'. Two Catholics and a Jew, Two Canadians and a Mexican, and so on
