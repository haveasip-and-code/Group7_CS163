Sprockets growl
An expression of annoyance, anger, or disgust (often used when making light of the situation) in the form of a guttural 'aaaaaaaargh,' derived from an episode of the Saturday Night Live sketch 'Sprockets' (starring Mike Myers as Dieter, the eccentric German talk-show host) that contained the feature 'Germany's Most Disturbing Home Videos.' The introduction of this sub-sketch featured an old man saying its title and then doing the guttural vocalization while moving his false teeth. ; Abbreviated as '{sg}' in electronic communication.
