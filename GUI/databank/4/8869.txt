blackbox
Originally a X11 Window Manager. ; Extremely powerful for it had a slit. Now it's dead. ; Linux users have now tooken it's soucecode and created [fluxbox], which is extremely good and much better than BB4Win. Fluxbox DEVELOPMENT VERSION offers Taskbar, and Icon Bar, not needed. As well as a more customizable taskbar and fbdesk for icons. Plus the remarkable tabbing engine, allowing you to group your windows automatically and manually. ; Window users can now sort of enjoy Blackbox on Windows as a shell replacement called BB4Win. You can still enjoy your [internet explorer] by using it instead of explorer for a filemanager. BB4Win isn't as good for sloppy focusing and it doesn't allow you to have tabs, or to shrink the taskbar to as tiny as you want it to, but it's still a good blackbox shell for windows and a good replace of Explorer.
