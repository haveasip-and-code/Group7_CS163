sanguivore
To put it is layman's terms, a vampire. These guys are the real kind, are mortal, have a reflextion, and are only SENSITIVE to light. They can go out in the sun and eat garlic and touch roses so get that fairytale crap out of your head. They need blood, though. They don't neccesarily LOOK like a vamp, thats a vampyre that looks like one, but need blood. A vampyre doesn't need blood and might not even be into that area, they just have a 'vampire fetish.' A sanguivore can also be called a sang vampire or sang vamp. There are also psy vamps, or energy vampires, who feed of of prana, or living energy of sorts.
