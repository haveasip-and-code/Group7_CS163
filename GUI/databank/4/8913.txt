townies
All other entries I have seen for the definition of 'townies' seem to be describing chavs. Townies do not wear tracksuits or burberry, they wear what is in fashion yes, but in a less noticeable and in a more decent way then chavs. They do not mind people who are not townies and will be mates with goths, grunges, skaters etc.
