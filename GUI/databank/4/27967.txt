mancut
Hairstyle worn by [ugly] women in an attempt to identify to all, that they are either a [dyke] or a [shemale] and that all should stay away unless they are game enough to dare trying laying a hand on them. ; Usually sought after by men of low standards or someone who feels that looks are 'on the inside'.
