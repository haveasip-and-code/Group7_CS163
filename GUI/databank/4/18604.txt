Basking Ridge
A rich misunderstood town. People who live there know that most of the kids are dumbasses and there are a lot of kids that have cut at one time or another. Half the town is rich and the other half either lives in the condos of Society Hill or somewhere else. A lot of the kids are preppy and even more of them live in the hills and wear A&F but think they are ghetto and try to act black. You know you're really in Basking Ridge when you see kids with popped collars and kids trying to be cool and 'ghetto'. There are also a ton of bands and Basking Ridge does have a ton of nice people, they're just a bit insane and misunderstood, yes misunderstood. Live there for your whole life and you'll know what I mean.
