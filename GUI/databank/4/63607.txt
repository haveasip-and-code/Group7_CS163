indie goth
a kid stuck between the world of [INDIE] and [GOTH] , not a poser child like you all will assume, but someone who loves the deepest darkest most 'hardcore' music of both worlds. ; for those who can't grasp the point: you dress like you're indie, but you dress it all up with a hella lotta black. (And don't forget the music....)
