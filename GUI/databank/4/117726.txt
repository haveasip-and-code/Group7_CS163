Witch King
The Witch King of Angmar. An extremely badass villain from The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. He is the Lord of the Nazgul, greatest of the Nine, in Gandalf's words. Flies around on a creature that kills Gondorian soldiers like they're ants. When on the ground, holds a huge-ass mace in one hand and a sword in the other. Leads the armies of Sauron to war. Has a badass image which is damaged when a woman (Eowyn from Rohan) kills him after giving a one-liner.
