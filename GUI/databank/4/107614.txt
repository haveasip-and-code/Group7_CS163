Netherweed
Weed from the Netherlands. It is the best. Period. There is nothing like it. Because it's legal to grow in the Netherlands, there are loads of extremely powerful species available such as White Widow, Northern Lights, Santa Maria, AK47, Bubblegum... and many of others. ; These kinds contain 15-40% more THC (the stuff that gets you high) than any weed grown outside the netherlands. Jamaican weed is acually crappy compared to it.
