Degrassi, a Canadian-based television show produced by CTV, follows the dramatic and always familiar lives of the Degrassi High teens. Basically my friends, it's the freakin best show ever. In fact, go watch it. 'Cause ya know what? You go through your daily lives thinking that everything makes sense. But it's in the world of Degrassi where you can learn the truth and how to save yourself. Because in Degrassi...it goes there.
