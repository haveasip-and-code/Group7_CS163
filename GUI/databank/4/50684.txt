exorcism
Exorcism is the act of casting out demons... not only by Catholics but born-again Christians as well. ; I can see how people would doubt it and call it a myth or what not, because it's just one of those things you have to see for yourself... ; I was the same way until I saw it happen in real life, mind you I am not religious at all. Infact I'm sure if I wouldn't have seen it happen I wouldn't believe it either.
