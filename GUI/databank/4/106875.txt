Wangan
The art of getting onto highways in heavily modified vehicles and racing either endurance or certain length's. Extremly popular in Japan with one highway in a circle formation, where 500+ HP vehicles go out and tear up the highway all the time. Harder to do in America due to the police actualy caring about Street Racing.
