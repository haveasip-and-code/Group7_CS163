ASB
ASB (an acronym for 'Associated Student Bodies') is an adult [furry] comic book about a lion who gets involved into an unrealistic gay relationship. ASB is very popular among furs, since it's about love and, more important, life. It features adult content, but certainly isn't adult-centristic. Highly recommended for anyone, no matter what gender and orientation you are. It's just cool.
