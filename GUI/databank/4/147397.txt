Corrupt Crew
1. A unique, revolutionary clique founded by Tom Bomb that enjoys life, lives for today, and realizes that money is the least practical tool in life because you can find the pursuit of happiness without being a workaholic and career motivated. ; 2. A concept where you oppose materialism, live for today, and your favorite hobby is fuckin' around and doing whatever you feel like for the hell of it. ; 3. Shits and Giggles is the Corrupt Crew's maxim
