Work-Charge
Sometimes you may get into a 'work-overcharge' ; This is a condition of the mind after you've done lots of non-stop work. ; Mostly shows up when multiple people ask you something to do and you try to finish the work as fast as possible but with great accuracy. ; The brain gets fully charged with that status and you experience some kind of '[drug]' effect. ; You feel like you can take on the whole world and you are in the mood to do lots and lots more. ; Some Symptones are: ; - Forgeting you are tired ; - Heavier Sweating ; - No idea anymore of the time or don't care anymore ; - Tired feeling when 'cooled down' ; When you take a rest or you are incapable of doing a requested action the charge will be most likely to cool down and finally go away.
