The Greatest show in the two universes!! ; It is about a Security Guard named Stanley Tweedle who accidentally got the key to the most powerful (and most phallic) ship in the two universes. Hence he becomes the Capitan. A love slave named Zev, who used to be ugly but became pretty when she fell in a machine with a cluster lizard joins him as she is running away from the competent security guards. On the ship they meet Kai a dead warrior from an ancient race who was reanimated by the very person he meant to kill to become an assassin. They also meet a robot head named 790 who can control all machines but for some reason falls in love with the crew originally with Zev then with Kai he now hates Zev because he thinks she is trying to take Kai away from him. Zev was changed into and even hotter Xev in the 2nd season when she died and was reborn from a man eating plant/girl named lyka. The go on many adventures starting in their own backwards yet advanced and organized universe, then comming to our universe first in heaven and hell, then it got really good on earth when they got political.
