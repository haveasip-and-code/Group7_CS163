Monobrow
A continuous strip of hair often found below the forehead. Often makes the individual sporting the aformentioned monobrow look particularly sinister or like a poor mans Michael Hestletine. The possession of a monobrow can almost certainly lead to the conclusion that the individual is also in possession of a particularly thatched chuffwig or in male terms a love nest that can only be likened to taking a jolly through the sparce but beautiful and necessary wilderness of Bush Gardens, Tampa Bay, Florida.
