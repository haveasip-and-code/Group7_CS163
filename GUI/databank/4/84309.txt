Marc Jacobs
A NY born and based designer who has inspired a cult following with his expert helming of an ever expanding roster of clothing lines ([Louis Vuitton], Marc Jacobs and Marc by Marc Jacobs being the major ones). His designs incorporate elements which may intially seem disseparate--80s club cool, retro charm, grunge, 21st century sophistication--but which he blends expertly into garments and acessories so intuitively right they whip the fashion world into a frenzy season after season. Friend of [Sophia Coppola], Wearer of v-neck sweaters, Genius walking.
