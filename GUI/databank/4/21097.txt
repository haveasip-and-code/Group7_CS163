lamina
Def: Animal backwards ; Its from a old Muppet Babies cartoon where Animal the muppet is called The Great Lamina. It tends to transaltes to people usually a specific person who is an unorthadox maniac especially in sports. Like really short people in basket ball who ram the tall people in the balls with their heads on a lay-up to prevent getting rejected.
