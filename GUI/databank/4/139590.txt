Ninjew
A disciple of Abraham himself, the Ninjew is ever aware of his surroundings. Skilled in the ways of Jew-Jitsu and Jew Fu, he can conquer any opponent before they can run. Silent, Deadly, and Jewish is some of their best traits, as well as stealth, percision, and mimicry. Thye can blend into the crowd without even trying to. Their skin scalds when in contact of ham products and non-Kosher foods. Their natural enemies are pirates, zombies, zombie pirates, communists, and of course, members of the Roman Catholic chruch.
