bro
The Miami version of a 'chunt'. A way to call every LATINO a straight up Paisa.. meaning straight tacky from their country!!! These people always begin every sentence with the word bro. For those who live in Miami, bro's are usually girls, and they reside in Kendall, mostly in West Kendall. They have nothin interesting to talk about and if they're not talkin shit about some other bro, then they're out gettin f*cked by every guy in Kendall. They are usually Colombian, Peruvian, or Cuban.
