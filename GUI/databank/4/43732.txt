Howard Stern
One of the biggest icons of the entertainment industry and someone who really revolutionized comedy. ; People with no brain will call him 'a loser who is ugly and says stupid things...' etc. but they miss the point that: ; a)it is hard to call a man who is a radio legend and multi multi millionaire a 'loser' ; b)the man knows he is ugly and says stupid things, that is what his comedy is based on: stupid and controversial topics. ; He is an unlikely celebrity and represents the underdog rather than being a complete fraud like many celebrities. so if you don't like him then go fucking pop in a Julia Roberts movie while listening to a Madonna or Cher album becuase obviously you don't like honesty ; DOUCHEBAGS
