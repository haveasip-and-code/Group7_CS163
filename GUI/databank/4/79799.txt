tu shay
An alternative to the word 'touche', which is defined as 'Used to acknowledge a hit in fencing or a successful criticism or an effective point in argument.' This alternative in particular pertains to the latter half of that definition only. Jon The Korean coined this infinitely useful, and infinitely hilarious, alternative spelling.
