Xbox 1.5
A console manufactured by [Microsoft] in order to be sold as a '[Next generation] Xbox' and squeeze their few faithful client's pockets for a scam, because it doesn't include next-generation media like [Blu-ray] or [HD-DVD], it's not enabled to be wirelessly connected (to the internet) right out of the box, it doesn't include a mandatory [Hard Drive] like the actual generation's, it doesn't support all three [Hi-Definition] modes ([720p], [1080p], [1080i]; just the first two) when it brags about Hi-Definition, it makes the smallest graphic's leap in console gaming history, it doesn't support it's predecessor's games natively (they are emulated, and not all of the games will be playable), it supports less controllers than the competition (only four), and it mostly includes sequels. All this when the competition includes what this silly object does not. ; Also known as Xbox 360, an Xbox 360 1.5 (Or Xbox 1.5 1.5, whichever you choose to call it) is well under way too, because Microsoft has considered adding an almost next-generation (because its counterpart is in fact the next-generation for sporting higher capacity and more layer potential) disc, the soon to be obsolete [HD-DVD] player (but not for games, just for movies in an [obsolete] format by then), and maybe a [TiVo] two or three years after the Xbox 1.5 launch, alienating its earliest consumers while at the same time making it able to struggle with the competition, that will be already sporting these features and more the day it launches, or more accurately, two years before xbox 1.5 1.5 is launched.
