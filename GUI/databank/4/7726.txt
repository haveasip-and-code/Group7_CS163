maroon 5
A great band in a music industry today where you can get by with talentless guitarists and overwrought whiny emo lyrics (see Taking Back Sunday, Hawthorne Heights, etc.) The band is a blend of rock,pop, and funk. The musicians are all very talented especially lead guitarist Adam Levine. The band has gotten a bad rep because emo kids don't like the happy, upbeat lyrics. Theres no depression or cutting of wrists in Maroon 5's music so why should emo kids care?
