midwest
a place were basically the average middle class Americans live, who work hard for their money. Not rich snobs in New England or the West Coast and not lazy welfare bums from the South. I'm from Western Pennsylvania which I consider to be part of the Midwest (only thing missing is plains). Not eastern Pennsylvania with all the snobs in Philadelphia.
