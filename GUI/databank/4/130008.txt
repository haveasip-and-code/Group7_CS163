western cheeseburger
A western cheeseburger is an extremely delicious, albeit unhealthy fast food. A western cheeseburger is like a regular cheeseburger, having 1-3 hamburger patties, each with cheese, but in addition has some sort of tangy barbeque sauce on the top and most of the time, 2 or so onion rings below the patties. This creates a delightful mixture of tangy sauce and the light crunch of the onion ring.
