Bassist
Actual meaning: Someone who plays bass. ; My opinion on some bassists: ; Some bassists try to take control of everything and whine if they dont get their own way. The reason is that because they learn lots of different scales, modes, arpegios etc.. and they think they are musical geniouses because they no all these and try to use them in each note, when really its so easy to play scales on the bass. They dont realise that on guitar scales are far more complex and envolve more technique as well as linking them to even more complex chords etc.. ; Whiney Bassists need to learn that they are not master musicians just because they no some very simple scales.
