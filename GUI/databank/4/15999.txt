Player 1
The name given to the player who's controller is plugged into the first slot on a video game system. This title is usually only given out during a multiplayer game. Such a title is almost always argued/fought over, as it holds an unspoken degree of authority with it. Player 1 is usually chosen by allowing the best player or owner of the system to take this position.
