TARDIS
[Doctor Who] travels in a time machine called the TARDIS--- Time And Relative Dimension (Dimensions) In Space. ; With the TARDIS The Doctor can travel to any point in time and space. ; The inside of the TARDIS is larger then the outside. ; The TARDIS used to have the ability to disguise itself according to its environment around it, but in 1963 when it landed in London it became 'stuck' in the form of a [police box]. The Doctor has given up trying to fix it, because he has grown fond of the [police box] shape. ; Also the vessel's navigation system is old and unreliable, which is why The Doctor explores the universe at random.
