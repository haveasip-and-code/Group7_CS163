Pepperdine
A school in Southern California where the sun is always shining and gorgeous men and women are abundant on campus. Just outside of [Malibu], the beach is a stones throw away and you are a minority if you don't surf. In the largely democratic state of California, Pepperdine remains a pocket of conservative students who hate the liberals, but love the Lord. Possibly the most amazing campus setting.
