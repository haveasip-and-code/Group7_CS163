Indiana Pacers
The Indiana Pacers are one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference of the NBA, and a championship title isn't too far off. The Pacers also have the most loyal fans in the league... not to mention probably the most polite fans (Indiana fans know better than to throw beer on players or call arenas making bomb threats...)
