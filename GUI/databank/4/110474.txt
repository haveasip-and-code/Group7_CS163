Post-Adolescent Idealistic Phase
A person who just graduated high school/college student who tries to act like an adult, but still behaves like a high-schooler. They usually tend to use large words, pretending to have a large vocabulary because they think that it makes them look smart and impressive. Tend to think they know everything. (hint-the whole cast of 'Real World')
