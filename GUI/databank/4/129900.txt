dundaruns
From the latin root words 'dundus' 'rundus' - most accurately, the act of stealing another's basketball and booting it as far as possible therein bringing the game, or 'run' to an unwelcomed end. This act of booting is usually accompanied by a spirited chant of the words 'DUNDARUNS!' Dundarunning usually is done to communicate a message of superiority or general dominance over an inferior or 'foul pitany'. The term has evolved in colloquial use to a more general application outside the realm of 'ball-booting' to signify the conclusion or finality of an event - e.g. 'the movie is dundaruns'.
