end of the world
at the end of the world ; the human race will look back and see ; that their misdead have been the cause ; the cause of their end ; the cause of their misery ; the last thing they will see is the begin and the and the end of what they have come to love ; and what they have mistreated ; the first person who see the end will say ; 'the only thing that I regret, if the lord, the eternal, can see what has become of his dearest planet he would weep at his most marveld creation of senciant was the only casue of the death of the planet they lived on'
