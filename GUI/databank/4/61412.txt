Google Widow
A woman who hears a man that she's romantically interested in use a phrase she doesn't know the meaning of, and instead of accepting the man's guidance on the subject by asking him, she looks it up on Google or another search engine for the meaning. She thus maintains her independence and self esteem and continues her unconscious pursuit of a lonely life.
