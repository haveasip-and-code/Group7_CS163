e-cepticon
A play on the term [decepticon]. In the prostitution industry, 'transformer' means transvestite/transsexual, and 'decepticon' means any very convincing transvestite/transsexual. ; An 'e-cepticon' is an online version, especially a female buddy or penpal whom you have known for many years, and who turns out (despite all evidence to tbe contrary) to actually be male.
