Unicorn Syndrome
A term loosely applied to preteen and young teenage girls who seem to be living half-inside a fantasy world. Symptoms include overuse of makeup (specifically glitter and eyeshadow), taking horse-riding lessons, wearing multiple bracelets and other tacky jewelery, reading medieval romance novels, et cetera. NOT to be confused with goths.
