Lotus Land
1. A nickname for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. ; Term comes from the land of the lotus eaters in The Odyssey, where people ate lotus flowers and 'A single taste of this native fruit made my soldiers forget everything they had ever know; where they were from, where they were going, everything.' ; It is in reference to Vancouver's laid back attitude and prominent drug culture (especially the large scale use and acceptance of marijuana).
