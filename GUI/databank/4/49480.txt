Boonetang
Noun. ; A variation of 'poontang.' ; Sex with someone you are not morally supposed to have sex with. This includes minors, married persons, members of the clergy, incest, and sex between stepsiblings. ; The term is derived from the ABC television show LOST in which stepsiblings Boone (Ian Somerhalder) and Shannon (Maggie Grace) have sex. ; Irony: The term 'Boone' is actually French for 'good,' making 'Boonetang' actually mean 'good poon.' In usage, however, it is 'naughty poon.'
