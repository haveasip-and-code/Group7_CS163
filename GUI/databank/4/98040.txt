Oldsmobile
Retired brand of cars overseen by GM. Also one of the oldest car companies in history. Pioneered front wheel drive in a world of rear wheel drive. The company collapsed due to sales which did not satisfy GM even after Oldsmobile completely remodeled itself with a fleet of more attractive cars from 1997 to 2004. To many, the closure was a shame because Oldsmobile created some of the most attractive badge cars in GM's line up. Examples include the Oldsmobile Intrigue and Alero which are considered in most cases to be more appealing than Pontiacs Grand Prix and Grand Am. The companies reputation and marketing did not hold up in the 21st Century and despite their quality vehicles, the GM divison, Oldsmobile, was discontinued.
