The Speaker
A male who claims to be strait while consistantly finding himself in the 'gay friend' position. He always listens to his female friends problems, and tells them they are very beautiful. He is a shoulder to cry on. Other responsibilities of a speaker include watching Disney movies and learning your female friend's favorite song on the guitar in order to serenade her. If you know someone who is a Speaker, you will find out that they insist that they hook up with more girls than a gigolo.
