Mid-America
'Jesus Land'... the vast desolate wasteland comprised of Wal-Marts, Republicans, RedNecks, and (I can't believe it either...) PRO-BUSH human beings. How can someone who follows such a great religion as christianity can possibly have any form of respect for a man who exploits that same religion to gain votes and popularity in polls? I don't know, how about we ask middle America. Wait a tick, we can't because they would start calling us 'terrorists' or 'un-patriotic', because we have the brains to question what our monkeys of 'leaders' have to say.
