my sassy girl
An original Korean movie about a bold and sassy girl who got no name, or at least not mentioned in the movie. The girl was played by Jun Ji-Hyun and the guy, Cha Tae-Hyun. ; Because of its success in Korean and in the other parts of Asian countries, damn Hollywood is going to make a remake of it.
