Brommage
'Brommage' is a term used to describe an action taken to 'diffuse' and argument in a message board thread, this is most commonly done by going off on a wild tangent which bares no relevance to the thread in question, it can also be put into action by suggesting 'everyone get along' or 'just be friends' and in some cases 'no more arguments' This method was used almost daily by the late great Pete Brommage. 'You Brommaged this thread, motherfucker'
