foosed
An offensive move in [foosball]. When a defender is trying to clear the ball, your offensive 3-man rod deflects the ball back into the victim's own net. A.K.A. 'Jedi-ed' because of the psychic skill it takes. ; Foosing your opponent earns you the right to call your opponent a girl's name (e.g. buttercup, doris, pocahontas)
