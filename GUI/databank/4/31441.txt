Vit
Vit is simply if you don't have an answer to anything, sometimes can replace any emotion or feeling. Pronounced simply and exactly how it looks, vit. But its not something you say in a normal tone of voice, its more of a soft deep slightly slowed down vit, almost as if you were making your voice raspy while saying it combined with all the previous mentioned. Practice it!
