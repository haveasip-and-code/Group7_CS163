guy next door
Basically the same sort of thing as a girl next door. He's sweet, charming, and quite cute, although he doesn't seem to know it. ; Guys next door don't really dig the whole taking advantage of a girl thing, and although able to be one of the lads, they can be great mates with girls as well. ; They dress casually, and although they don't try to stand out in the crowd or be the centre of attention, they still shine. ; Guy's next door usually have one of those laughs or smiles that is able to make you feel instantly happier. ; As part of a relationship, guys next door are typically the kind who seem quite casual about dating- they don't try it on fast. But, as with a girl next door, the guy isn't seen as being that involved in a relationship... but anyone who's been in one with a guy next door will know that they're dark horses, and alot more fun and pasionate than you first thought. ; So if you find a guy next door (and you happen to be a girl next door)... this one's a keeper. ; Bring him home to the parents no problem!
