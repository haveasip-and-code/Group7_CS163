plain white t's
A Chicago born band, led by lead vocalist Tom Higgenson. They have two cds, Stop and All That We Needed. If youre a real hardcore fan, you will also have their first, not well known cd (making three all together) titled Come On Over. Its hard to find, but the freaks should have it. Higgenson is backed up by Dave Tirio - Guitar, Mike Retondo - Bass & Vocals, De'Mar Hamilton - Drums, Tim Lopez - Guitar and Vocals. The boys are finally making their way through the scene getting some air time on Fuse, and before you know it these boys next door will be your new favorite band. The T's are also the best alternative/indie/whatever you wish to call it band.. ever.
