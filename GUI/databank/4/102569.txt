Abercrombie and fitch
Started back in 1892, originally called Abercrombie & Co., Sold hunting gear, mainly african themed. Some years later, a lawer named Ezra Fitch, a lawyer and frequent customer to Abercrombie, joined partnership. Thus starting Abercrombie and Fitch. ; Abercrombie and Fitch was THE store to buy anything- Be it a toothbrush or a foot stool. However, overtime, the sales slowly dropped and Abercrombie and Fitch went into a Regression. Around 1996 [I believe] Abercrombie & Fitch was bought out by a Bigger clothing manufacturer, and started producing clothes. Their sales sky rocketed, and have been up ever since. ; In current times, Abercrombie and Fitch is the drinking pool for Popular, rich american youth. From items priced at $9.90 to $198.00, you can pretty much find anything; Flip flops, jeans, shirts, colonge, hell- even backpacks and postcards. ; Subjected to Ridicule, most people fail to see the point of Abercrombie and Fitch. Yes, it sells pre-ripped jeans and faded shirts, because that is the current style. ; No, they have not always sold ripped jeans, but they have people working around the clock to follow trends. People who whine and complain about Abercrombie usually cannot afford or access the store, so they poke fun at it. ; However, they are completely ignorant and oblivious to such Brands as D&G, and A X, which ACTUALLY sell T-shirts for $100. ; So, let people who love Abercrombie simply love Abercrombie. Speaking from personal opinion, i made the switch from Surf clothes and such to Abercrombie because of the comfort and durability. ; So, I leave you with this ancient proverb. ; 'Buy cheap, get cheap.' ; p.s. for those who banter 'stop shopping at Abercrombie and go to laCoste' needs to drown. LaCoste, like Abercrombie, is made in Sweat shops, but sells for about $40 more per polo shirt then Abercrombie. But then again, maybe you've never been into Saks Fifth before.
