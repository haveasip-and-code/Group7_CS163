kashmir
1. A territory between India and Pakistan, the subject of international dispute between the two countries. ; 2. One of [Led Zeppelin]'s better songs. In fact, Robert Plant was nowhere near Kashmir when he wrote the lyrics to this. He was actually a continent away in Africa - driving through the desert in Morocco!
