paolinize
The teenage Christopher Paolini published the book Eragon in 2003. Despite the fact that his book gained a huge following, a small minority of amateur critics reacted angrily to his misuse of vocabulary and suggested that he had merely rifled through his thesaurus. They accused him of being a [pseudointellectual] and from that accusation comes the word paolinize. To paolinize it to effect a personna of superior intelligence through use of advanced vocabulary, an effort that is foiled by one's use of words out of connotation.
