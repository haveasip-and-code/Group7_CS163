NOS
A brand name, and probably the most popular of them, for nitrous oxide. The name stands for Nitrous Oxide Systems, and well, it is just that. Referred to as 'spraying', or 'bottle', or 'Cheating', it is a very simple way to enhance power of the internal combustion engine. The nitrous oxide (N20) is kept in a bottle and is directed to the intake through your fuel injection or carbueration(more time consuming to install). Thoug it is called nitrous, that is not what enhances performance. When nitrous oxide is heated to about 570 degrees F. (the combustion chamber temperature.), it splits into 2 parts nitrogen and a part oxygen. Everyone knows that an engine likes to breathe, and by the N20 splitting, the added oxygen allows it to do just that. By allowing more oxygen, you also allow more fuel, all this explains the horsepower boost of maybe 10-30% depending on the amount used. As for the nitrogen, well, it makes the exhaust look cool, especially on straight pipes!
