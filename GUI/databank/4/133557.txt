Syntax error
The most fucking irritating thing that can happen on a calculator. You press all these numbers and you THINK it's the right button to press but really the calculator's been LYING to you and you've really fucked up big time, but it waits until you've pressed the = button and then it flashes with 'Syntax error' which is basically calculator talk for 'FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKED IT! NOW THE REST OF THE CLASS CAN ADVANCE TO QUESTION TWENTY-THREE WHILST YOU ARE STILL TRAPPED AT TWENTY-TWO, YOU INADEQUATE CALCUATOR-USER! I HATE ALL YOU STAND FOR AND YOUR WAY OF LIFE!' etc etc.
