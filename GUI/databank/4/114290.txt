Chesley
A rare species of monkey-suit wearing WASP with a quickly retreating hairline. Currently displaced from his native habitat of Washington, D.C.for the mating season in Burlington, VT. Thursday? he's a bum. Walks everywhere but on occassion can be found on 2 wheels trying to rid himself of a budding 'Buddah'. Has bad luck with favorite baseball teams. Also goes by the name poodles.
