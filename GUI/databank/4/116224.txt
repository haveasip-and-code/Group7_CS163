fatty arbuckle
popular vaudville comedian, famous for his trial in which he was accused of raping an actress with a beer bottle and crushing her to death with his weight. during the trial it became apparent he didnt do anything like that, and today it is almost universally agreed that it was just hearsay and untrue. while popular for his silent films earlier, he was hated due to the rumor after the trial, and fell into drinking. he had a few roles and movies after the trial and tumble, but was found dead soon after. it is a sad, sad story, and Fatty's legacy is often overshadowed by his name, trial, and other comedians of the day, such as Groucho Marx.
