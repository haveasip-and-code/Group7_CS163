Retro Revival
A new movement of bands from 2001 on up playing rock music that has the feel of music from the 60s and 70s. Older bands that have had influences on Retro Rock musicians include but are not limited to: ; The Who (usually a major influence) ; The Beatles ; Jimi Hendrix ; The Ramones ; Led Zeppelin ; Retro Rockers usually act and dress like the 1960 mods. The composition of retro style music isn't just roots 5th chords and senseless uneducated nonsense (which are primary features of the retro subgenre 'garage rock') they usually try to show off some musical maturity by letting the lead guitar show of his/her chops.
