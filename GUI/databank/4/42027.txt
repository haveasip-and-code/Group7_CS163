Hugh Dancy
A very very good looking British actor. He not just your average hot British guy: he studied English Lit at Oxford (an amazing school), where his dad is a professor of philosophy. Hugh is also fluent in French and a fantastic actor. Another plus, if you've been seeing those new '[Burberry] Brit for Men' cologne ads, you've been looking right at Hugh! And, to be even more convinced of his hotness, go rent 'Ella Enchanted' in which Hugh plays (you guessed it) Prince Charming! It's an amazing movie, and Hugh is an amazing person with an amazing personality, and he is extremely hot!
