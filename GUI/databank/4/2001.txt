da hui
Da Hui started in 1976 when Eddie Rothman and Squiddy along with Perry Dane and other 'Braddahs' were tired of the Haoles from the mainland and Australia coming to the Islands taking all the ways and Disrespecting the locals. The first time people ever saw Da Hui or back then they were called 'Da Black Shorts' in full enforcement was during a surf contest which was held by Fred hemmings in 1976. Eddie Rothman and his Crew paddled out during the second heat ( a contest of which they were not in)They caught waves and and were surfing as if there was no contest. Fred Hemmings was so angry that he told some local guys to paddle out to stop them. The local boys replyed 'Fuck you Haole you know who they are?' Fred had no idea who these guys were and he because of his ingnorance said 'no who are they?' the local boys replyed again and said 'Brah, that's Da Hui and nobody messes with them' Now there is a reason why Eddie Rothman and his Crew paddled out that day, and it was not an act of being a badass or getting in the mags, No.The reason was they were tired of all the political bullshit surfing contests had. Alot of mainland and some australian sponsers would hold surf contest and not even once have one Hawaiian in the contest. It was a powerful point they made that day. Thus from then on Da Hui has been respected all over the islands and is in charge of all water safty for surf contest on the North Shore of Oahu and they help and sponser alot of beach and ocean clean ups all over the world... So here's some words of wisdom from a Memeber of Da Hui. ' Treat Da Hui them with Respect and let them have there share of waves IN OUR OWN LAND, Either be nice or Get Bus Up' (beat up)...Aloha
