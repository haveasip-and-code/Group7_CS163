Namey McNamerstein
The act of being the umteenth person to use this sequence of first/last naming for someone who is doing something. It can be used as a way to take something positive and make it seem like the butt of a joke (ex. #1)Often this is a vain and low intellect attempt at taking back some pride after being made jealous or being shown up(ex. #2). A guaranteed laugh for all with IQ's sub 100. Definition barely adequate explanation, see example.
