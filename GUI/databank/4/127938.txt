frates
n. One who, in an attempt to look cool amongst his or her peers, will claim to consume massive quantities of beer at a party, all the while leaving a majority of the cans half-full and strewn about haphazardly, so as to 'hide the evidence' of doing so. Often, when caught, the offender will offer the excuse of not enjoying the 'warm swill', or [porf], at the bottom of the can. The assumption is that a frates will seem cooler by having 'had' a whole case of beer, and will score later that on that night with multiple pigs, or babes with questionable morals. ; v. The act of casually, violently, or discreetly tossing , hurling, or dropping a half-full can of beer into the bushes, high-grass, sand, or parking lot, announcing too loudly, 'Guy, gimme another bee-ah! I'm so wasted, guy!' ; The act of fratesing is an attempt to hide the fact that the whole beer is not empty (a party foul), and the loud proclamation is camoflage for the loud 'doink' of the half-full aluminum can of (usually) cheap beer.
