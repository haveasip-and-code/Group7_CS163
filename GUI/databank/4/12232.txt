mediality
A reality created by the media. In this subuniverse, everything is perfect. All the women are beautiful and all the men are muscular an manly. Unfortunately, this unreal mediality causes people in real life to attempt to attain these extremely unreachable standards, usually with unwelcomed and ugly habits.
