Voluntourism
Heaven help me, yet another nasty new noun, the unholy marriage of 'volunteer' and 'tourism'. ; Voluntourism, an act carried out by 'voluntourists', is when hoardes of - generally - the great unwashed backpacker brigade descend on a place to do have a jolly nice holiday - usually at precious little cost to themselves - and do the occasional bit of good work. ; Looks good on one's CV as a gap year activity.
