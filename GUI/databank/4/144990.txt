Death Combat
A game of wits, where 2 or more people face off in karate stance. They then gently press onto each others crotches and or penis massaging with brute strength. Like a game of chess, each player must use strategy to win. Whoever taps out loses, and must leave the field of combat. You may also rub the ass, and put each other in gridlock holds so that the other opponent cannot leave your grip.
