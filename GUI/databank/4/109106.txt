Sloucher
A sloucher is a person who sucks the insides of live or uncooked crustation out into their mouth (chewing it) and spits it back into the crustation. A sloucher repeats this motion until the insides of the crustation are somewhat liquified. Finally the person ingests the Slouche ; there for deeming them a Sloucher.
