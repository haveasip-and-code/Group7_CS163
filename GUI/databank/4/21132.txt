ratfink
a cross between a rat, a fink, and a mouse. This is an odd animal only found in seclusive arounds in western egypt. It evolved quite a bit ago when a natural formation of toxic chemicals spilled on to a fink colony in the ground. The smell atracked rats all over the world to partake in the delicious meal. The finks, only half dead at this time, were consumed by the rats and were absorbed into the rats' DNA due to the nuclear contents of the fink. This disaster was the end to Finks, but the birth of ratfinks. However, this disaster made the rats shun the ratfinks because they were different.
