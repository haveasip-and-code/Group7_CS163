mingler
A member of a social atmosphere without a particular group. A mingler simply wanders from group to group. He or she may be friends with [jocks] as well as [nerds], [goths] as well as [preps]. The enmity between the groups which he or she befriends themselves do not concern a mingler. They are society's neutrals, and generally very outgoing with an individual sense of style.
