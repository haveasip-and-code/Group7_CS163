triclavianist
Led by their young warchief, Thrall, the orcs suffered a series of setbackson their journy across Kalimdor's Barrens. On their trek across the desert they found an antique object known as a triclavianist. When one would touch it, they would disintegrate. So the christian guild stepped forward and tamed it's evil anti-christ powers. Now, anyone who is called a triclavianist is known as a hot piece of Troll ass.
