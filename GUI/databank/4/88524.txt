Mid-Life Crisis Mobile
(mid lIf 'krI-s&s 'mo-'bEl) ; abbr. MLCM ; A Mid-Life Crisis Mobile is traditionally a small, sporty automobile, and most often convertible. Common examples of such an automobile are the Mazda Miata, the Lexus SC430, the Chevrolet SSR, and any of a large number of Italian cars that cost as much as a house. The archetypical owner of a Mid-Life Crisis Mobile is male, 37-50 years old, has hair that is thinning or graying (or both). If there is a passenger, there are two possibilities; a female approximately the same age as the driver (the driver's original wife), or a female in her early to mid 20s with bleached hair and enhanced cleavage (either the driver's mistress or new trophy wife). ; Compare to [Daddy Bought It Mobile]
