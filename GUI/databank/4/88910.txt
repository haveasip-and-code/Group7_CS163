scene bands
Basically the bands that really piss me off.. ; THERE APPEARANCE:they look like complete idiots they all wear tight clothes and look like little clones i dont know whats with the scarfs either.its all highly feminine and makes them look really really homsexual. ; THEY THINK:there ultra cool and evreyone fancys them and there the next best thing.ie ARROGANT ; THE GIRLS:are up there arse i must be the only one i know who isnt. ; EVOLVED:they evolved from emo the cool rend before emo sucked but scene kids are the worst. ; HOBBIES:pretending to love art,reading books,pretending there hard done to,and if there no good at music they will do art as a subject. ; STYLE OF MUSIC: usually envolves screeching(run over cat type liek a girl) not roaring system of a down,slipknot type.not that im a fan. ; sorry about the bad spelling.
