Sucking on a rocket
2) The act of ceasing ones life, either voluntarily or in-voluntarily, by having a rocket launched at either them and/or their vehicle. Holds greater meaning when the target was moving at the speed of, or greater than, a sprint, and/or if the rocket launcher must be reloaded after a single round has been fired.
