G Wood
A man who has now achieved a near mythical status; some find his accomplishments so incredible that they doubt he even exists. Christened David Wood, he broke every single sports record in every sport he played, but then had his name removed from the record books out of fairness. Changed his name to G Wood so that people wouldn't know his true identity. Has had numerous fierce battles with one Big Bubba Bruiser.
