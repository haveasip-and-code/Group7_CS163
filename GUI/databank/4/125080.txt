Spoilsbury Toast Boy
The Spoilsbury Toast Boy was a small child haunted by beetles. He lived with his grandmother until one fateful evening when she was murdered by an evil beetle. The beetles whispered in Toast Boy's ears and suggested he kill her and burn her nipples. When he went out to fetch her some Speckled Huckleberry Leaves, he returned to find her dead, her head burnt, slain by a monstrous beetle. The beetle continued to haunt the troubled child and add to his insanity, until 'good beetles' suggested they come to their apartment where they would 'fix' him with their Brain-Fixing Machine. The Toast Boy accepted, but on arriving, was brutally murdered by the beetles' machine. There could me a moral or hidden meaning to this story, but it is too deep for anyone to work out.
