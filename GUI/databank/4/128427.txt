berticus
Berticus is the bear who appears in the PBF cartoon, 'Sgt. Grumbles'. While he should be launching the counter-offensive, he is hiding in the bushes eating honey. This cartoon takes after the user 'Berticus' from the GeneralMayhem forums. He is often referred to as a bear because he weighs like, 340 lbs. in real life, no shens. ; The Berticus regime consists of a mob of unemployed alcoholics who post 'BERTICUS BERTICUS BERTICUS' everywhere the username is seen. From Myspace to YTMND, WWU to UO, there is no question that this bear is the cutest and cuddliest of all internet celebrities.
