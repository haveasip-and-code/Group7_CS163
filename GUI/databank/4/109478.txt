1. When you do not feel like elaborating on anything. Especially when the aforementioned phrases do not link in any way whatsoever. You would end the thought with 'etc.' because well, you just realized...you're an [idiot]. ; 2. When you do not wish to elaborate further on a topic where it is understood what happened next.
