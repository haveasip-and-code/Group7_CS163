DaMulder
DaMulder, the original one at least (there are 2 or 3 copycats on the net), has been roaming the depths of the Internet for over 10 years now. He can be found on Gamesites occasionally posting skins and artwork. Also publishes Articles occasionally. He will soon be publishing a book under the Pseudonym (or real name) 'Phil Windgassen'
