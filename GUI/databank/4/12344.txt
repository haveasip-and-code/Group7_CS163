GCB
Goodbye Cruel Board (noun): ; A thread posted in which the thread starter announces they are leaving and never coming back so that everyone will feel obligated to beg them to stay and give their self esteem a boost. The person has no intention of leaving and really just desires a thread or two of pampering.
