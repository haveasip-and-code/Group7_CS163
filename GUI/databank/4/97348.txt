keith moon
2 words, 'A legend!', no, really, once drummer for the who, but died in new york 3 1/2 months after a reenactment gig they did for 'the kids are alright' in 1979. this man was also crazy, I mean crazy, this is the sort of guy who threw cherry bombs down upon police officers from his hotel room window, and once, in Saskatoon, Canada, got so bored he resorted to chopping ALL his hotel furniture into kindling.
