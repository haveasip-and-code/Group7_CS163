Melvins
One of the best bands ever. They've been around for twenty years, and they're going stronger than many of the young upstarts fresh out of the gate. They're currently on Patton's Ipecac Records, the place for music. Quite plainly, they just rip shit. ; Buzz 'King Buzzo' Osbourne--Guitars/vocals ; Dale Crover--Drums ; Kevin Rutmanis--bassist
