Marmite
A black, gooey spread, almost a form of yeast extract, allthough far superior, produced by the allmighty Bestfoods corporation(, the only true Marmite being made in England; you really can't eat that shit from sanitarium, I mean the name alone can make you hurl. UUugh). and made, as many will tell you, from second hand brewers yeast. (yum-yum.) THAT is the true reason beer was invented, it was a part of the divine plan to bring the pleasure of Marmite, or [Ambrosia], to the world of men. ; The term is interchangable with [Ambrosia], for it is indeed the food of the gods, though this is little known. ; This delectable spread is eaten by some with honey or peanut butter, but the classic recipe is fresh white toast, spread with butter, which must melt swiftly so the Marmite can immediately be administered and then quickly devoured, in time to prepare the other slices of toast before they go cold. ; of course, some mortals cannot stand the euphoria that comes with eating this food and say that it is the most revolting thing imaginable, to cover their inability to comprehend such divine fare, and so the human race will forever be divided between the 'lovers' and the 'haters'. ; I have travelled this world in my search. There is no substitute.
