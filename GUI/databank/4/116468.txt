South of the Border
A hotel chain, one of which is in South Carolina. It is rather tacky and is like a mini-Las Vegas, except Mexican themed. It's mascott, Pedro, is featured everywhere, including the many reminder signs you see before you reach the hotel. Some of the local teenagers enjoy driving out to these signs and using them for target practice. If you pass by any of these signs on the road, be sure to look for bullett holes in Pedro and/or the revolving sheep!
