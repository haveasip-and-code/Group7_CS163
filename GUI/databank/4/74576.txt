American football
American football is the most mentally involved game in the history of the world.for those who think it just about a bunch of big fatties runnig into each other, try reading a zone defense. players have to remember hundreds off different plays, formations,and what to do on a certain play, depending on what the defense does.in fact, the biggest men on the field,offensive linemen, have to be the smartest players and have the best techniqe.it is a game of leverage and angles.it is the greatest teamsport in the world. in order to have a good team, every body on the team has to be eaqualy important. not only is it mentaly demanding, it is one of the most physically demanding ones too. it is because not only do you need endurance and running ability like soccer, you need strength and agility. if american football players did not wear pads, not only would many people die,but more than the early 1900s when they wore no pads. players are bigger stronger and faster.and even though you wear pads, it is still more painfull than every sport , except rugby,wrestling(not wwf, real stuff)and ufc, or cage fighting,boxing.if you dont agree with me on the physicallity, watch any high schools 2 a a day summer practice.or even better try it.you guys are just mad because it has not only become americas pastime, but americas obsession.and pads make it harder to run too. there is only 25-35 seconds between plays, timeouts are 1-2 minutes long,2 min between quarters, and 10 min half. not 5 mins. between plays like you little bitches said, and im talking to all who undermined football, dont judge it unless you've played the real thing, and you have played it and you still dont like it, you a least respect it.simply said, it is the best sport in the universe!!!!!!!!!
