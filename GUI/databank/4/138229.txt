Chevi
Of Dominican origin, from the combination of 'CHEVERE' (kind of old spanish word which means 'cool' used throughout Latin America) and 'JEVI' (mainly Dominican word which also means 'cool', but in a more youthful way), resulting in a new word which means 'cool' aswell, but in a trippier, more-than-jevi sense. ; The 'E' es usualy elongated, to emphasize just how 'CHEVI' something is [Cheeevi] ; *(Note: In no way related to Chevrolet cars, but pronounced just like 'Chevy')
