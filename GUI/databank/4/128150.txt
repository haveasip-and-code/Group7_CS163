Fulton
1. A county in Georgia, adjacent to Gwinnett. The north of Fulton includes Duluth and Alpharetta, a very racist and spoiled area. The south of Fulton is a less upscale, ghetto area. There is little understanding on why north Fulton is so KKK-influenced. Gwinnett, which is also predominantly caucasian, is much less prejudice to non-pale people. Popular opinion is that the parents strongly influence and enforce racism on their children. A popular site in Fulton is the Regal Cinema. There, [punkass bitches] smoke [weed], dip, get in sissy fights, snort the lemon stuff you get when you buy a ticket, and hook up with underdeveloped 13 year old [pussy] (see, that little blond girl was a freshman, how could you not tell). ; 2. Also, [Mike Jones] is fucking huge in Fulton.
