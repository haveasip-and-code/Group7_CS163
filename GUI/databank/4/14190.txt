trance music
Electronically originated music with a tempo of at least 130 and at max 150 BPM that uses the same melodies used in classical music rather then normal electronic music melodies ; it is not essensial for trance to have a beat under it there are trance songs which do not but it is very common to have a beat. ; what most people know as trance music e.g: productions by 'Special D' , 'Lasgo' , 'Jan Wayne' etc... is not trance this is called eurodance or pollitacally incorrect: cheese it has some trance influences but it doesn't use the typical trance melodies but instead happy melodies and is nowhere near the complexity of trance with as purpose to reach high places in pop charts.
