Millzie
Canadian in origin;often used to describe a very confused and immature boy whose guy friends tend to get a little too close to each other, all the while maintaining claim to their heterosexuality. Cute, yet deceiving, he will invite you up and in, and he will get it up, but just don't hope you'll get it in. Also used to describe the one that totally dissed you, yet you can't be angry at.
