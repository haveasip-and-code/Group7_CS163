Judah Christian school
A lameass school in Champaign, Illinois under the admninistration of Dan Cole, who doesnt have a clue what in God's name he is doing...... Example of a lameass policy..... (excerpt from handbook) any student who misses 15 or more class days ,without special permission from the administration, will have to attend summer classes, in order to advance to the next grade, because that student has not 'mastered' that subject......... so sure even if youre gettin a C or above in all of youre classes, you still get flunked! basically they are incouraging you to bring sick kids to school so they can get other kids sick....stupid evangelists
