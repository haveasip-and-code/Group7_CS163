blow out
The most ridiculous looking haircut to ever be sported by white people. It's an extra long tape up that is gelled into spikes, making the hair look like an extra greasy afro. A required hairstyle to grind with the true sluts in ANY Long Island club. The most famous, and arguably the original, blow outs are worn by Carmine and John Gotti Agnello, stars of A&E's 'Growing Up Gotti.' For accessories to complete the look, see [tape up].
