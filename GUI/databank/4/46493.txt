Pleasex
A word that is both a command and noun. It is a combination of '[please]' and '[sex]' that originated from a history teacher's Freudian slip. It has two meanings. One, a command, means 'sex please,' as in, 'I want sex and I want it now.' The other, a noun, means sex that is relatively pleasant, although not necessarily outstanding.
