Paramus
Paramus, an upper-middle class boro located in the heart of Bergen County, also known as the land of 10,000 malls... well actually just three: Garden State Plaza, Paramus Park, Bergen Mall and a ton of other retail centers that line the choked-up arteries of Routes 17 & 4. A place where gridlock is a way of life and the Holiday shopping rush takes on a whole new meaning. Paramus is also home to the most neurotic cops in all of Bergen County... where else can you get a ticket for making a left turn at 7PM at a no left turn street (from 5PM -7PM), or talking on your cellphone in the middle of Rt.17 when clearly a million other people are doing the same exact thing around you. It is obvious that this is a place where people are on the move...to the malls that is, with their platinum credit cards in hand. Where else in Jersey do New Yorkers come to shop but here? But eager shoppers beware, if you plan to max out your credit cards on a Sunday, the only sign you will see at a store entrance is 'Sorry, we're closed.'
