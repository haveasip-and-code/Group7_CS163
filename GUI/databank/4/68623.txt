tasmania
A beautiful island off the south-east coast of the mainland of Australia. Some of these poofy mainland people need to grow up. EVERY Tasmanian you will find has just one head. The Tasmanians I have met besides being helpful and friendly have no need to shag sheep either dickheads. While I'm on the subject does anyone here mention the fact that some mainlanders shag dingoes? Let's leave that one, shall we, for fuck's sakes give it a bone. You people who carry on with this shit, are just a bunch of reetarts. the point is Tasmania is in a state of economic and cultural revival and any of you people who carry on with this two-heads, sheep-shagging and shit, need to get a fucking life!
