Bryan Adams High School
Crappiest school in Dallas. Emphasis on crappy. I mean it's the worst school in town. Only good thing is the girls, well the ones who are not slutty. Now in sports. BA SUCKS!!! And even when we win we still suck. ; Bryan Adams beat W.T White in wrestling and yet even the B.A. coaches say B.A Wrestling team sucks. ; ALL OUR COACHES SAY WE ARE THE WORST AT EVERYTHING!!! ; FYI: BA SUCKS!!! ONLY GOOD THING...SOME OF THE GIRLS!!!!
