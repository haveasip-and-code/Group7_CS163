Akira
An anime and manga created by Otomo Katsuhiro. The manga ran from 1982 to around 1993, and the movie was released in 1988. Often considered to be the definitive anime film, Akira is a science fiction/cyberpunk that features excellent animation and a unique musical score. The movie isn't as complex as the manga, but it still features many important philosophical lessons (especially concerning the abuse of power). The movie is also very violent and action packed, but it is also extremely entertaining. Akira is a cult film as well, and it has been popular with many underground anime fans since 1990 when it was dubbed in English. ; Overall, Akira was an important movie that redefined anime and introduced a new approach to Japanese animation. It opened the door for anime to the West as well as inspiring movies such as the Matrix.
