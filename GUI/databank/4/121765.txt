beijing
The most kick ass capital in the world!!! where corrupt politicians, rich company owners, really poor ghetto merchants selling shit off the street like together in harmony and peace, despite the fact the the politics are messed up as long as you stay where you are and live your life as it is, noone'll do anything to you. ; Also a place where people driving in ferraris, lambroghinis, hummers, rolls royces and bentleys will drive past people with cars with only one piston, 3 wheels and a crap load of shit in the back trunk. ; A place where people are controled wonderfully because of the communist party, if it was some democratic party who ruled china, the poor people would rebel their asses off. ; A place where you can find new york like areas and farmlands smelling like shit. ; A place where you can get both real and fake rolexs, louis vitons and all the luxury stuff
