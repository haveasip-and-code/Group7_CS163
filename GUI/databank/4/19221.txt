arty1manparty
An honorable title which can only be acquired when one reaches the state of self-enjoyment to the extent where that person can carry out a party on his own, enjoying himself and not knowing everyone else left. The parties continue even after the keg runs out and marijuana always enhances the experience... Hey! Play some modest mouse. If you give this person any shit, be ready to get your ass kicked.
