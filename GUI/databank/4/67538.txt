fiona apple
Singer-songwriter-pianist noted for her poetic lyrics, uncommon wordings, very long album names, and low alto voice. Born Fiona Apple Maggart to Diane McAfee and Brian Maggart of New York in 1977, she is vegetarian, and her albums include 1996's Tidal (featuring Shadowboxer, Sleep to Dream and Criminal), 1999's When the Pawn[...] (full title When the pawn hits the conflict he thinks like a king/What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight/And he'll win the whole thing fore he enters the ring/There's no body to batter when your mind is your might/So when you go solo, you hold your own hand/And remember that depth is the greatest of heights/And if you know where you stand then you know where to land/And if you fall it won't matter, cuz you'll know that you're right. Featuring Paper Bag, Fast As You Can, and Limp) and Extraordinary Machine, which is at this time unreleased because the Epic cheeses 'can't find a marketable single.' Despite this a DJ in seattle has gotten hold of a copy of the album and intends to play it in its entirety over a period of weeks, thereby also leaking it onto the internet. Suspiciously, no charges have been pressed.
