asiaphile
A white man who'se only contact with Asian women has been as waitresses and images in the media of prostitutes, madams, more waitresses and princesses of exotic, far-off lands, and thus his image of Asian women is tainted, he sees them as sex objects or exotic novelties. ; I don't think this word, with it's proper definition fits every single white high school kid who has a crush on his Asian American classmate, or every white dude that thinks Lucy Liu is a fox.
