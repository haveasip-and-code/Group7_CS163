utada hikaru
A generally overrated J-pop (R&B) singer, who recently failed to break into United States mainstream pop music. Her lyrics are garbage, her voice is nothing remarkably original, she switches on and off from English and Japanese. She has some catchy songs, but it ends there. She unfortunately has the biggest-selling album in Japan's history. She is known here for singing the 'Kingdom Hearts' song.
