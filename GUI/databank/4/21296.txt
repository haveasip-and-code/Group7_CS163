dunne disease
Dunne disease can be found in almost any type of person, young or old, excluding crack heads. It is characterized by overwhelming lethargy, or, more specifically, the inability to do anything productive, especially if it involves moving. Often the devastating slothfulness is also accompanied by an even more grating constant complaining. When it is present it almost always has to do with the affected persons needs, such as food or water, which that person simply cannot meet themselves. ; Dunne disease is normally fatal only because those affected with it will starve to death, or be killed by the people around them who've grown tired of their fucking bullshit attitude and constant whining.
