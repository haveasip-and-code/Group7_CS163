Kaiser Chiefs
A 'wacky' indie pop group from Leeds with about as much depth as the shallow end of a paddling pool. Were previously a garage rock group called Parva but became Kaiser Chiefs when they realised copying American rock wasn't earning them any fans or credibility. Hence, they decided to copy 90s Brit rock instead. Against all odds have become hugely popular, probably due to the fact the [NME] spent every other issue hyping them up. Consistently use amazing and often poignant lyrics to comment on everyday British life, such that would rival the wit of Morrissey eg 'Cause we are birds of a feather and you can be the fat one' Despite their lack of song writing skills everyone seems to love them. Fans defend them because they are apparently just cheeky lads making good indie pop music, however, The Futureheads manage to do this far more brilliantly. Some may question the integrity of the band, especially when one reads that Ricky Wilson claims he would 'wank of a tramp for success'
