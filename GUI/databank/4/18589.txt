Little Miss Mason
A person who tends to hum and dance in front of the telly to annoy her friends. Has an affinity for kittens, melons and rugby neanderthals. Generally a girly-girl at heart despite having a mean streak and an underlying dark, twisted sense of humour. ; Sweet and playful at times though frighteningly violent when intoxicated. When provoked, items hurled at friends include: rotten apple cores, old newspapers and home made fish-finger sandwiches (don't forget the tartar sauce!).
