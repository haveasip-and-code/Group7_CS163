blizzowned
When the company [Blizzard] [owns] your stupid ass for pretty much anything in [World of Warcraft]. ; You know you've been blizzowned when: ; 1) Your character gets [nerf]ed. ; 2) You try to exploit the game and Blizzard already thought that you'd do it and premptivly blocked it. ; 3) Your account gets banned. ; 4) When you glitch the game somehow and your character has been rendered useless in one way or another. ; 5) When you say that Blizzard won't fix something via patch, but in the very next patch, that particular thing is fixed.
