Dir En Grey
A good japanese band. When they first started they had a more visual, feminine style that reflected in the music and clothes. Over the years they have dropped the visual effects for a more masculine approach. As can be seen in the album 'Vulgar'. In 2004 they have totally dropped the visual kei gig. The music became heavier and more american influenced. They still sound good.
