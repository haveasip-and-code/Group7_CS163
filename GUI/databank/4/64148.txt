Sterrance
In [Strong Bad] E-mail numba 119, (in which he gets the [Lappy]), Spud Jr. asks Strong Bad what he would be if he were an animal, what would he be. In reply, Strong Bad creates Sterrance, a blue creature that is much cuter than that stupid washed-up old [The Cheat] she used to have. He looks very good and impressive for the Lappy.
