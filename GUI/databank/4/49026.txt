Java Guest
The name for the creatures who use irc java chat. They come and start randomily ranting or cussing about 'sex0rzsff' 'pokemoins' or even 'havck0ringz'. Javas tend to create words in the english language on the fly, and never make sense. The concept of font size, spelling, and basic self-control are lost to Java Guests. It is important to remember to never say hi to one for then they start focusing on you, after their real goal: cyber sex. If you did make a mistake and contect one, you can not ignore them, this will cause them to start flooding for no reason. Your only choice is to /ignore.
