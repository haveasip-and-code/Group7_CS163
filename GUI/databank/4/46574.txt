Airwolf
An early 80's TV show about a combat helicopter that was mysteriously in private hands. It looked suspiciously like a standard commercial helicopter painted black. ; Despite Airwolf being a superweapon with super-missiles coming from a little launcher in the bottom, it was maintained solely by some guy who looked like Earnest Borgnine and piloted by a man with the questionably masculine name of Stringfellow Hawk. ; There was also another dude who blacked out half of his eyeglasses called Archangel. He was cool, because he didn't need depth perception to kick ass.
