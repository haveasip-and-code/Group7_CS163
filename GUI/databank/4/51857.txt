Homeland Security Advisory System
a system of fear tactics to keep the uninformed, ignorant, and resistant masses under the government's control. The System is divided into 5 risk levels; Severe, High, elevated, guarded, and low. its rarely Low because there is WMDs and 'insurgents' in Iraq. It is really convenient to raise the alert before a political event where there may be protestors-I mean terrorists.
