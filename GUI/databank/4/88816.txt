e-bitch slap
Much like its real world counterpart ([bitch slap]) an e-bitch slap is a verbal slap with forewarning in response to something stated over the [internet] - usually something dumb. Its goal is to leave the stupid person/[troll] speechless and hopefully deter them from further [shenanigans].
