burnley
a shite hole 7miles off blackburn, there nearest rivals. Burnley always try and compete with blackburn, especially in football, but never seem to succeed. Above it says that rovers cant maintain a decent position in the leagus even though our subs are the price of burnleys whole team: ; 1) burnleys team must obviously be shit ; 2) blackburn are still in the premiership so they cant be that bad ; Burnley haven't caught up with the rest of the world yet, surviving on their local produce of cabbage. ; And yes it is true, the league of gentlemen has been based on burnley (the inbred scum)
