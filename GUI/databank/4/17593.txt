Yorks Corners
A place where the meek resides. Often found counting his pennies and wondering how to find more. Dreams of Golf but unable to decide when to use the 9 iron or was that the 5? Jelous of everyone who gets laid! Cheaper than Scrooge. Has an IQ of .02 and often daydreams. Stops in the middle of a sentence and waits until his brain cell grows back before continuing.
