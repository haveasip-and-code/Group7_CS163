CutMan
One of the first original 6 [Robot Master]s that appeared in the very first [MegaMan] game. CutMan is numbered Dr. Light #003, and was built to be a logging robot. He posesses a pair of scissor-blades atop his head which he can hurl at the opponent to slice them. The blades act as a boomerang and return to the user shortly after. Though an expert with sharp objects, CutMan posesses a relatively flimsy framework, meaning that heavy, crushing objects will hurt him... A LOT.
