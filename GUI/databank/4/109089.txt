LS6
Later versions were variants of the LS1. The LS6 featured redisigned cylinderheads, a new plastic intake manifold, and a camshaft with increased lift and duration. Some also featured titanium valves. The factory horsepower rating was 385HP on some ZO6 Corvettes, and later models were rated at 405HP. However, testing has shown that the real output of the engines are higher than their factory ratings.
