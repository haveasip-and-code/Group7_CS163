Newt 'Rebecca' Jorden
The name of a character in the movie 'Aliens', produced by 20th Century Fox. Portayed by Carrie Henn. Is an occupant of the 'Hadley's Hope' mining colony on the planet LV-426. Has a brother named Timmy and is daughter of Ann and Russ Jorden. Was sent, along with her family to find an alien ship that contained alien parasites that killed their hosts and spawned new aliens. Was the only survivor of the alien attack that clamied the lives of the people in the colony. Newt can also fit into small spaces and crevices where the aliens can't reach her. Was rescued by a team of military personnel who came to the planet to investigate the status of the colony. Formed an emotional bond with Ellen Ripley, the fellow survivor of an alien attack. Was kidnapped by the aliens while escaping from Hadley's Hope and was almost impregnated with an alien embryo, but was saved by Ripley. Newt died when, coming back to Earth, her cryotube was flooded with water after the ship they had been travelling on was attacked by an alien and they were forced into escape pods that jettisoned to an isolated planet. However, she still survives in (the clone version of) Ellen Ripley's memories.
