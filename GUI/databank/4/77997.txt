Pillar of Autumn
An aging UNSC vessel, and one of the smallest in the UNSC fleet. This ship, along with crew, Captain Keyes, and the Master Chief, crash landed on Halo. At the end of Halo, the starships fusion reactors go supernove, sterilizing the land, and creating a HUGE crater in Halo. Un able to with stand the forces exerted on the new weakpoint, halo breaks apart.
