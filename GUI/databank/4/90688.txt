Sorrow
Sorrow. Sorrow would be the feeling I feel seethe its way within my soul every moment, every day, ever year. The feeling I get when I think that I may have actually found the love of my life, the one person to cast my doubts and fears aside. 'Tis also the feeling that has remained pent-up within me for so long, other words used to describe it. Loneliness, forlorn, solitude, it all means one thing... empty on the inside, void of all feeling and deprived of compassion and love. A feeling that I fear will soon consume me entirely, and I know not how it will end... but I do know one thing, I know that it WILL end. I shall see to it... personally.
