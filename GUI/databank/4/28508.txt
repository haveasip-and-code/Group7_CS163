Russian Switch
The Russian Switch is a common trick used in Russian Literature and by Scott Baumgartner. While the etymology of this term is somewhat ambiguous and often misunderstood, it has most commonly been associated with the act of performing a meta-switch involving the major forces of nature acting upon the conquered world. The Russian Switch cannot be realized theoretically - it must be fully actualized in an active, not passive, manner.
