Sonic X
A new, anime revamp of the popular Sonic The Hedgehog video game character, and is another in the long list of BAD Sonic cartoons (seriously, SATAM is the only good one), both the original and dubbed versions suck as. ; The addition of human chracters and a two year relocation to Earth completly tarnished the unique aspects of Sonics' world, Robotnik reverts to the name 'Eggman', his original name in Japan, for this new version as well, this show seems to have a divided fanbase, the fans of the show being total four year old or retarded dumbasses, and the other being fans of the much missed SATAM cartoon that actually had a script and a direction.
