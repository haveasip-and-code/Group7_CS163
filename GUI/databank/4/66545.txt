pop the collar
Something that metro's do. This act of popping ones collar is a sign that someone is openly metrosexual and will often sport a gelled mohawk, ben sherman polo top, deisel shorts and designer flip flops and listen to dance/trance music. Although they may appear gay, you can find most metro's hanging out at pubs or the beach scamming on young chicks or hairdressers (female). These types of 'preppy' metrosexuals are found in Australia and are usually of Aussie or British descent. They also tend to drink alcoholic beverages such as Corona or Carlsberg whilst watching the Rugby or AFl, but tend not to yell or shout like normal aussie blokes. Metro's can also be found hanging out at their local university.
