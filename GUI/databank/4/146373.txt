Cirque Du Soleil
An extremely creative, and talented, French-Canadian modern day circus. Created by Guy Laliberte and Daniel Gauthier in 1984. Many of the shows tour all over the world. The headquarters of Cirque can be located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. ; What sets this circus apart from all others is that it consists of elaborate costumes, music, settings, mesmerizing acts, and extremely skilled performers. There are also no animals used in any of the shows, and most shows seem to tell a story, similar to that of a play or ballet.
