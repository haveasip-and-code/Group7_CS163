contract movie
A contract movie is a movie so emasculating, that if a guy is talked into seeing it with a female (since let's face it, that's the only way), it says in writing that the guy is getting action. That way, she can either make good on the contract or said guy can sue for breach of contract. Either way, he's getting reimbursed for seeing that piece of crap.
