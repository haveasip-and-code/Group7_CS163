joe strummer
Born John Graham Mellor on August 21, 1952 in Turkey. ; He gave himself the name Joe Strummer because although he was left handed, he learned to play guitar on a right handed guitar, therefor he could only do the strumming chords. ; Pre-1977, Joe was in bands such as The Vultures and The 101ers. ; However, he is best known for his work in the punk rock band, The Clash. He wrote most of the lyrics, and shared vocal duties with co-band member [Mick Jones]. The Clash lasted from 1977 to 1985. They released several great records, most notably 'London Calling'. ; In 1995, Joe signed onto Hellcat records with his group, Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. ; Joe died on December 22, 2002 of heart complications. ; In my opinion Joe is one of the greatest musicians of all-time, and was a really great guy. RIP Joe
