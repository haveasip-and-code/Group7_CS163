staffordshire bull terrier
mastaman obviously aint got a clue what he's on about yeah staffies may be owened by the majority of chavy scum but their not soft and can just as easily be trained and used to aradicate chavs from the earth forever. staffies are the origanal pit bulls. when english and irish settlers moved to america they took thier staffies with them and bred the bigger dogs with the bigger dogs resulting in a bigger dog. but in esense its the same breed that has just chaged slightly over time and when veiwed side by side it's easy to see. some blood lines of pitbulls still produce dogs of staffie height(around 16 to 17 inches)
