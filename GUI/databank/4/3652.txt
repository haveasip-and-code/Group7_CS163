goth
A darker culture that can be anything you make it. Some impose guidelines, and other sad, decrepit, pathetic creatures try to follow those guidelines, but in essence, most 'goths' revolve around the basics of wearing dark clothing and being non-Christian. [Marilyn Manson] is not NECESSARILY goth, and neither is [black metal]. They could be considered goth, they could be considered not. It is entirely up to the beholder.
