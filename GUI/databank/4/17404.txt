ski santa fe
a great snowboarding area, a 20 minutes drive from santa fe new mexico. This is the greatest place to snowboard in the rocky mountains it is much better than taos or vail. it is a snowboarding paradise because it isnt full of snotty asshole rich people who crowd the way and hog the mountain
