south farmingdale
South Farmingdale is an awesome town on Long Island, New York. It seamlessly sits on the border between Nassau and Suffolk. Exit 32N off the Southern State Parkway provides easy access East or West. Republic Airport is also another mode of transportation bringing in visitors from nearby municipal airports. A big attraction is Adventureland, located just north on Rt. 110, with cool rides for the little ones and a great way to spend a family day. South Farmingdale also marks the Southern part of the Rt. 110 Business Corridor with SUNY Farmingdale at the base.
