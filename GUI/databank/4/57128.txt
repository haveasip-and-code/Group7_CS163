Your Mum
'Your Mum' is the original english version of the insult. The American readers among us will be more accustomed to 'Your Momma.' The insuslt can be added as a come back (though not a very good one) to any insult. The comeback does not have to be related in any way to the insult and can be completely incoherent.
