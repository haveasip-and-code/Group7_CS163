ugly american
The tendency of American tourists visiting foreign countries to completely insult the culture of those countries, almost always accidentally. Many behaviors practiced by 'ugly americans' are simply innocent mistakes involving actions that are perfectly acceptable in America, but are shunned in foreign countries. Some universal symptoms of an ugly american is excessive amounts of luggage, overly casual clothes, etc. However, others vary from country to country. For example, in France, you will get your ass kicked if you refer to fries as 'freedom fries'. They're french fries over there, and they're eaten with a fork. To them, this signifies an overly patriotic American with no respect for other cultures. A far easier mistake to make is, in Australia, the peace/victory sign made by sticking out two middle fingers is the equivalent to saying 'up yours' if the palm is facing the person it's directed at.
