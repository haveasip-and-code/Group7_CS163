Ed  Edd  'n' Eddy
A really shitty show on Cartoon Network. This show is poorly animated, and just sux. It's not funny, just retarded. ; This show is a perfect example on why kid cartoons suck. ; [adult swim] is the only thing CN has going for it. As a matter of fact, [as] is fucking awesome! I would rather have a child watch ATHF and South Park rather than the shit on CN. At least South Park has good moral lessons to it(don't believe me, watch the end of just about every episode). ; ATHF keeps it real!
