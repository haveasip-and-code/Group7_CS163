sting
Lead singer for one of the greatest bands ever (who seem to go unappreciated) THE POLICE! ; I believe The Police are one of the most underrated bands of all time. Lead by Sting, who wrote most of their songs lyrics, The Police were a force to be reckoned with. They fused rock, reggae, new wave, and punk together to create such classics as 'Walking on the Moon' and 'Roxanne'.
