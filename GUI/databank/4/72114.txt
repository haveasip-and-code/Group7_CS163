kate winslet
Hugely over-rated and over-paid Brit actress. Lacks any ability whatever and is so wooden that she probably practises by chopping tree bark in a wood shop with Woody Guthrie. Her very best performance (in her first film - a sort of childhood fantasy set in New Zealand) was just average, and she has gone downhill ever since. Chiefly memorable for having earned US$60 million from Titanic. She had a cool contract because everybody thought the movie would be a flop. Since then she has pretended that she is just an ordinary english rose and an ordinary mother, as she bosses around various servants and buys rolls royces bulk.
