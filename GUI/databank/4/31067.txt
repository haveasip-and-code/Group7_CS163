rockland
Rockland county is a suburb of NYC. It is neither upstate, nor is it a barren wasteland. Upstate is anything north of the NY/PA line. A lot of Rocklanders live less than 2 min. from NJ, which definitely does not imply 'up'state. 15 miles NW of the city? Yup, that's Orangetown. Closer to the city than a lot of places in Westchester.
