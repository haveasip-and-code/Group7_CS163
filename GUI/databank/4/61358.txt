Lolita
A Japanese fashion consisting of poofy knee-length skirts, lacy tops (normally blouses or [cutsew]s), pretty knee-highs or tights, and lots and lots of lace. Has absolutely nothing to do with Gwen Stefani. ; Has several subgenres, the most popular of which are: ; Gothic Lolita: Basically the darker side of loli. Best example is Mana's clothing line Moi Meme Moitie ; Sweet Loli: The more sweet side of loli, most common colors are pink and blue. Best examples are Baby the Stars Shine Bright and Angelic Pretty. ; Kurorori: Basically a lolita who wears nothing but black. Even if it's a Gothic Lolita dress, if it's all black, it's a Kurorori dress. ; Shirorori: A lolita who wears nothing but white. Even if it's a Gothic Lolita or a Sweet Lolita dress, if it's all white, it's Shirorori. ; Related Fashions: [kodona], [EGA] ; Note: If the skirt becomes too short, or there is not enough lace or poof, it is no longer loli.
