Playstation2
The greatest system of all time, hands down. Even coming a year before XBox it is still superior because it has good games with actual gameplay instead of graphics. And if you want a game with good graphics check out Gran Turismo 4 so you can stop complaining like a little bitch. Those who have XBox try to recruit stupid morons into getting such a waist of money so they don't feel bad. For every good game XBox has Playstion has about 200 good ones. Those who are true gamers own a Playstation or a Nintendo. Those who own an XBox are wannabe gamers and will never be a real one.
