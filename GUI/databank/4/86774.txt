Hoff
noun, pertaining to David Hasselhoff ; Common usage 'The Hoff', implying that he is the original Hoff to which all other usages are derived. ; Not contrained by his hit TV shows 'Nightrider' and 'Baywatch' or an obvious lack of acting, singing and modelling talent, The Hoff has become a post 80's email hit. ; Clearly the act of 'Hoffing' (see further definitions of [hoff]) has escalated in recent times. The quick and efficient medium of email has made this crime against humanity too easy and the Victims of Hoff & Hoff Related Emails Crime Unit (VOHHRECU) has seen a dramatic rise in Hoff related violence, psychosis, and even suicide. ; Hoff related emails have also been on the increase. The Hoff's arch nemesis [McGyver] has started an emailing war, apparently enraged at The Hoff's born-again stardom. Other 80's B-grade celebrities also involved in the 'coalition of The Hoff' in this war include Magnum P.I., [Mr T], William [Shatner] and even the enigmatic Ingelbert Humperdink. ; The whole concept of The Hoff is currently subject to parlimentary review and legislation is being considered to curb the disturbing trend of Hoffing.
