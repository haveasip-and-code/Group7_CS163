tron
The deck no one ever plays anymore. ; 'Blue [Urza]tron' is/was an infamous deck used in the popular [TCG] [Magic: the Gathering], in the old Type 2 format. (All sets from the Eighth Edition and up. The current Type 2 as of this writing is Champions of Kamigawa through Ravnica:City of Guilds sets of cards.) ; It is typhically based around the 'Urza' land cards, basically lands with the word '[Urza]' in their name, combined with a lot of overpowered expensive cards in an obnoxious way. It was also probably used in every single major tournament, and hated by people who can't afford/don't know how to use it. ; Anyone who runs Blue Urzatron in the current format at the time of this writing probably has no idea what they are doing.
