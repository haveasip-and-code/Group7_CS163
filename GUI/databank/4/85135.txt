All Your Base
At first, it was stated with in a game for the Sega Genesis known as 'Zero Wing'. In which the enemy states 'All Your Base Are Belong to Us.' The game otherwise was fine it seems, I never played it truely, but looked up on it. ; Later a flash movie was made, in which the intro was the scene the phrase was stated then lead to a catchy song. THe words are only versions of 'All your base' 'all your base are belong to us' and a catchy tune. All the while a flashing of screenshots with the words 'All Your Base' are put in to match quite nicely. ; To see this and many other renderings, I suggest Newgrounds.
