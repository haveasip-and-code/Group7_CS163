An expensive champagne from the true [Champagne] region of France. Several varieties, but you will have to pull out your [paper] if you want this one, no [frontin] with fakes because it is the bottle that tells your ladies what you are drinkin'. Good for rich [peeps] or [gangstas] in the club or more specifically, back at the [crib]...[Fiddy] drinks this, along with probably Bill Gates and all the people with [bling].
