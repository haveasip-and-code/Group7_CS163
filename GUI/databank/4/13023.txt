Toastie
[this is NOT meant to be racist] - A black person that is really white on the inside. ; Sitting in the car with my friends thinking about a kid in one of my classes. I said to myself, this kid is more white than black. So I thought of a toasted marshmellow. Black on the outside, white on the inside.
