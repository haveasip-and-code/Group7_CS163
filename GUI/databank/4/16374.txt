Texas
The best state in the USA! ; We are NOT cowboys who ride around on horses with our cowboy hats and boots. ; if you wear a cowboy hat and boots anywhere but west texas or a ranch, you are basically asking for a beating. ; there are cities ; there are not ranches everywhere ; If you have a southern drawl, it is noticed because it is not that common. ; not everyone loves bush. just like not everyone where you live loves bush. some people like him. others dont. its actually pretty balanced. ; i love texas ; you should too.
