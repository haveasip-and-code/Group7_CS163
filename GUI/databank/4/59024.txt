monkeybutter
An inside joke among Bellsouth Dial-Up tech support agents (actually [Calltech], who outsource for Bellsouth). Comes from a phony customer listing named 'Monkey Butter' which was used much like a message board between the agents. It had a lot of funny posts and lots of HTML. It was eventually deleted when one of the supervisors caught wind of it. ; On a related note, another agent created a listing called 'Son of Monkey Butter' and was fired in short order for it.
