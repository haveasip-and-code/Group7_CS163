quofing
The present participle of [quofe]. ; Emitting penile flatulence, i.e., emitting air or gas from the penis through the urethra. ; ETYMOLOGY: 'Quofe' is the male form of [queef]. ; NOTE: Quofes are a rare phenomenon compared to queefs because it is much harder for air to become stuck in a man's urethra than in a woman's comparatively larger vagina. Quofes occur most frequently after a [catheter] has been inserted into the penis and removed, leaving air trapped in the bladder or urethra.
