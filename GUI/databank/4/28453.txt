liberalism
by far the best form of government that any country could have. ; liberalism is about the individual and his or her rights and freedoms, not about multi-national, multi-billion dollar corporations bent on destroying life as we know it, and the useless brain-dead [neo-con]s who mindlessly follow them like the lemmings that hey are.
