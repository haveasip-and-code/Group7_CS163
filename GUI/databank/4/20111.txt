fruit cup
A CONDOM. This word is created with the Chinese word for penis which is 'papaya', and the American meaning of the word which is a kind of fruit. Since you put papayas in fruit cups, it would be like putting your penis or 'papaya' in somthing. The penis is the fruit and the condom is the cup. And that's how 'fruit cup' was born.
