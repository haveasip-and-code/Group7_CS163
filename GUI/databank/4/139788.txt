Death and Rebirth
Death and Rebirth is an [Evangelion] movie. After the 25th and 26th episodes of the Japanese Television [anime] [Neon Genesis Evangelion] were released the fans revolted. Studio Gainix had run out of money and the final two episodes of the series were released with poor animation, contained a false 'happy go lucky' ending and were overall very confusing. The fans through a shit fit and sent death threats. When Studio Gainix pulled some money together, and got a bit of a hand out from every animation studio in Japan, they produced two [Evangelion] movies. The first of which was Death and Rebirth. The first half: Death, was a broad recap of the first 24 episodes. Rebirth however was no more than the first 15 minutes of the next movie. The fans once again threw a shit fit and sent death threats. Finally [The End of Eva] was released, 'and all's right with the world.'
