fraternity
A sorry excuse for on-campus participation in clubs and a form of 'purchasing' friends or as they are known amonst themselves...'brothers', for life; in which their frats always has to be named around 2 to 3 greek letters, revolve around a 5 party school weekday with different types such as a 'kickback' or a 'hoe-down'...with non-stop spirits all night
