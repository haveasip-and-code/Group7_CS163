sarcasm
Noun. A very British form of humour which derives laughs from saying something while really meaning something else. Often (though not always, contrary to popular belief) used in scathing remarks. ; The word 'Sarcasm' is derived from a Greek word meaning 'tearing flesh', which is why sarcastic vegetarians are so ironic. ; See also [irony].
