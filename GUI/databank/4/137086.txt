Australian Expeditionary Forces. An extremely large gaming clan originally founded for the game Battlefield1942 by Enfield Gatling. Based in Australia and now crossing several game platforms the clan continues to go strong with several teams entered in the Battlefield 2 competitions. ; Currently lead by Malthius (Previous leader of 1st and prominent in several other clans historicaly) they are still going strong. Members can be found on the GameArena servers, on their website or on their IRC channel found irc.aus3d.net originally constructd for them by Justaguy (Who turned down a chance to instruct to move on to the successful Armchair Commandoes [ac] clan.) Renowned for a general sense of fair play but not without their share of bitter ex-members, wannabees and just play a-holes.
