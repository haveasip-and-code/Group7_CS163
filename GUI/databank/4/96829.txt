a mad one
A period of time spent doing nothing that isnt completely silly, hopefully bizarre & enormously fun! Usually undertaken when under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both. ; Best enjoyed after (in fact it only really qualifies as 'a mad one' after) at least one night's sleep deprivation. ; (It is also worth noting that 'a mad one' is normally accompanied by almost continuous, totally sincere but basically pointless, apologies to anyone nearby who is halfway normal)
