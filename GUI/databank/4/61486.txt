gumblybub
A toy to entertain children, often located in places of business, car showrooms or airports. It consists of a dedicated table with numerous individual wire shapes attached to the surface. These wire shapes include rainbow, loop-the-loop and corkscrew. Beads with holes through the middle are attached to the wires, and the child pushes the beads back and forth through them.
