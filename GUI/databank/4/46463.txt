Peckerhead
n: A person that tries to create a long, romantic kiss by utilizing the multi-peck mechanism, without use of tongue. This leaves the kissee, although drunk, in a state of confusion and despair. This is usually followed by a lack of communication between the kisser and the kissee, signaling the death of the 'relationship'.
