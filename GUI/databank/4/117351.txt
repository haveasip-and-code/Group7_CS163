paper launch
A release of a product, especially a computer component, in extremely limited quantities, making it very difficult for consumers to get their hands on. The purpose of this is generally for a company to be able to say 'we have the fastest chip', before they can actually produce large numbers of them. ; Thus, the product isn't really 'launched' to the market, it's only launched in press releases, hence 'paper' launches.
