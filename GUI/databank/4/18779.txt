kundalini
The word Kundalini is derived from a Sanskrit word `Kundal' meaning coiled up. It is the primordial dormant energy present in three-and-a-half, coils at the base of the spine in a triangular bone called the Sacrum. The Latin name `Os Sacrum' suggests that it is a holy or sacred part of the body. The ancient Greeks were aware of this and therefore they called it the `Hieron Osteon', noting that it was the last bone to be destroyed when the body is burnt, and also attributed supernatural powers to it. Egyptians also held this bone to be very ; valuable and considered it the seat of special power. ; In the West, Sacrum is symbolised by the sign of Aquarius and by the Holy Grail, container of the water of life.
