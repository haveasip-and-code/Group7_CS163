pushrod
A shit piece of mechanical engineering. It causes in engine to drop torque at high rev ranges, and is bad for fuel economy. ; It also causes plenty of friction in the engine making it inefficient. ; Anyone saying that its good becoz it still beats ricers is dumb.... becoz these people have 8.0 litre cars that guzzling the living crap outta petrol ; see [v8] and look for post by SIKUNT.
