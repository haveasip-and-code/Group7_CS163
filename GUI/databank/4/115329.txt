ALABAMA
Well, it is a shame that people judge this beautiful state due to their lack of knowledge. Alabama's education is improving every year. Bessemer high school in Birmingham, AL, was ranked the number one high school in the country thanks to the outstanding performance of students and their (national) test scores. The University of Alabama, Auburn University, and many more colleges and universities are ranked among the best in the nation(These facts can be viewed on the internet). Not only the education, but the cities are among the best. Huntsville, AL is one of the main reasons NASA is where it is today. Technological advances are conceived everyday to help improve the space program and potientially the benefit for mankind. God has blessed this state with wonderful and faithful people. He has also created beautiful moutains, valleys, and beaches, and yet the history of this great state adds to the immaculate beauty. It is very unfortunate that people have to be so critical and narrow-minded about Alabama and the South itself. The South is where its at, and you will never know untill you experience it! Oh by the way, racism exisist everywhere and not just in Alabama. The few racist people and 'rednecks' that reside in Alabama are not recognized by the predominant society of noramal people. This includes the entire Southeast.
