Vienna  Virginia
Names the 4th best place to live in the country, also in the richest county (fairfax county) in the country, you can imagine how rich people are. The cops fucking suck and spend their time pulling over madison kids because they have nothing else to do. Madison is the town's school, vienna inn the the best restaurant ever (especially for a hangover), wendys is the spot to be if nothing is going on, dont drive on 123 past 11:30, town curfew for minors is 12 its fucking gay, 5 minutes from the new and improved tysons corner (what a bitch) biggest mall on the east coast, all i can say is more fucking traffic, SUPERNOVA biatches
