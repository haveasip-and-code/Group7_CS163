Suicide
Dispite our efforts, it is considered a final option that is available to many. Attempted by some (for an unfathomable number of reasons), and commited by many to cease a relentless pain. However, it is more painful to merely exist and endure your present situation then commit this act that is deemed 'insideous' by the masses. In short, one commits this action once 'coping' and sustaining forces are dwarfed by an incomprehensible amount of pain.
