of the gay
basically gay; a way of saying that something is gay without directly calling it gay ('of the' is used to signify that the thing being referred to is of gay origin, and it's left to the listener to deduce that the thing, therefore, must be gay--but note, that the listener has a choice here, and is free to be ignorant, or perhaps unrealistic, in order to think that, maybe, just maybe, this thing is of gay origin, but miraculously it's not gay)
