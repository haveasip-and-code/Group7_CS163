Nep
A wily, sometimes believed to be a ficticious character said to be born in the late 20th century. While farily reserved and secretive early on, the 21st century has proved to be an exploding point for this tyranic specimen. Like the biblical character Samson, all of his power is yielded in what some call his hair, which is often blinding and needs to be contained by an advanced form of a headband. Uncannily, he also possesses the ability to hold a handstand for several seconds. Additional super powers include the ability to drive the average person to insanity with the constant screaming of several different phrases. When in trouble, radioactive socks are used to paralyze and drive away any foes who seem to be a threat. While nothing has been confirmed, this diabolical genious has once finished a slider in one half of one hour.
