Daddy Bought It Mobile
A small, affordable, sporty automobile. Common examples include the Mazda Miata, Chrysler PT Cruiser and Ford Mustang; in especially affluent neighborhoods, the Audi TT roadster and BMW Z3 Coupe are popular selections. The typical driver of a Daddy Bought It Mobile will be under 20 years old, female, with bleached blonde hair. As one can expect from the phrase, the driver of the car is rarely, if ever, the buyer. The buyer is the driver's father, an aging [yuppie] who only wants the best for his daughter (and has spoiled her completely rotten in the process). The Daddy Bought It Mobile is easily confused with the [Mid-Life Crisis Mobile]; the easiest way to tell the two cars apart is that the Daddy Bought It Mobile will likely have something shiny dangling from the rear-view mirror ([Mardi Gras] beads are the prevalent choice).
