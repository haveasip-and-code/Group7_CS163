bronwen
meaning 'white breast' in welsh it is thus obviously a woman or man with large white breasts.the name is humorous as when shouting after a friend called bronwen in wales you will be standing in the street shouting 'white breast!' or could just be kept as a private joke between parents with a young child who doesnt understand welsh. ; sorry Bronwen it had to be said. love you still my darling sister. hahahahahahaha!!!
