Ketamine
A, frankly, boring drug that you have to snort in enormous amounts to get into a [k hole], but more often than not you'll sneeze after a couple of nostrils full and revert back to normal, feeling ripped off. ; Besides, who the hell first thought that it would be a good idea to snort animal tranquilisers in the first place?!? There's a place for [special k], and it's Battersea Dogs' Home.
