but i'm a cheerleader
1. a great movie with some chick and Clea DeVull, about going to a gay-brainwashing camp to turn you straight and how these two say fuck it and get it on with each other. ; 2. a cheerleader/sorority sister who'll refuse to be labelled as bisexual or a lesbian but still insists on fucking a girl every nite.
