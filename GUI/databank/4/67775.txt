A group of elite girls that no longer exists due to a petty drama that could have and should have been dealt with in a better manner. If the situation was dealt rationally, the possibility that this group still existed would have been greater but instead, they acted like middle-schoolers. The result? The group no longer exists, and some friendships among the girls no longer exist. How pitiful.
