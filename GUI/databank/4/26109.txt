waffler
N: One who waffles, from the verb [waffle], meaning to never settle on a stance on one (or more) issue(s); A waffler usually goes from one side to the other and back again, usually multiple times, depending on who (s)he is talking to at the time. See also [panderer]. ; There is a subtle difference between a waffler and a [fence-sitter], most notably in that the [fence-sitter] never actually decides their stance on an issue/issues. ; This term is derived from the food of the same name ([waffle]), probably because the grid-like patterns on the food resembles how a waffler is on again and off again on their views. ; The word has recently made a return to the forefront of common communication with the arrival of John Kerry's (United States) Presidential campaign.
