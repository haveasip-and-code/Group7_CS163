ETS
1. Stand for Evil Testing Satan! (or, if you want to be correct, Educational Testing Service. They make such crap as the [SAT] and others like it. Although a universal and standardized test is needed, surely there can be something better than the SAT. (The [ACT] is made by another company so it is much better but it could use some work too, although not nearly the same amount)
