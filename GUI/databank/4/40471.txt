rage
to destroy or cause irreperable damage to another's property or person, usually without malicious intent and easily forgiven later. Involves alcohol consumption, nudity, and shaving cream. Participants may only use the word 'RAGE' in preparation for and during this event, and it is always screamed as forcefully as possible.
