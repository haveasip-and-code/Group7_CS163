Ri-COCK-ulous
A funny word that you can use in normal conversation to throw people off... it has the same meaning as Ridiculous (IE: proposterous, crazy, ludicrous) But replaces the DICK part with COCK, making it funnier... And if you feel so inclined you may put the word 'Fargen' in front of it (which has the same meaning as 'fucking') to make it sound even better...
