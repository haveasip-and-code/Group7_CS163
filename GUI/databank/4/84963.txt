Automatic Updates
An annoying feature of [Microsoft] [Windows XP] [Service Pack 2]. It automatically downloads 'critical updates' to fix [security hole]s found almost daily in [Internet Explorer] and in other parts of the [operating system], then it harasses you to restart your computer. If you click 'Restart Later' the box will pop back up in about five minutes.
