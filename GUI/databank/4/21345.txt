Ball
A game played by using the ball that we got at Niagara Falls for vacation. This game is very similar to catch except i always throw it hard at my brother and make him call me big poppa.. o yeah thats right.... i went there! Quote Stewie from family guy, 'Nevermore.' Anyway, we outta go play ball now and get in the other room so that we can watch American Idol in approximately 7 miutes from when you a=look at this. Ha I'm right!
