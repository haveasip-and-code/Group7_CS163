anti-semitic
is also not a word. since when is someone anti-arab?, Arabs are also semitic. If your anti-jew, then that should be the word. Not anti-semitic. Anti-Semtic means you are against Arabs, Hebrews etc. ; he's anti-semitic, he hates arabs. ; the word 'Anti-Semitism' should be liberated for all Semitic people. And Jews are not Semitic, They are Khazarian (Ashkenazic, European) The Only Semitic Jews are Sephards
