mugfugly
A word created to insult someone so bad because their uglyness is so unholy that you had to combine the words mugly and fugly to create mugfugly. this word overides even Hippa-Crocca-Dogga-pig in terms of uglyness. Beware after saying this to someone it has the power to remove the soul and forsake the person to an oblivion eterity in the underworld.
