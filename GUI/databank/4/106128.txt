a great place in LANCASHIRE not manchester, sadly has been invaded by paki's but still full of good people. a great place to go out and get hammered. gets bad publicity as being a shit hole, which in many parts it is, but not all. home to the only team called 'latics' in england albeit they are shit, 5,500 people love them!
