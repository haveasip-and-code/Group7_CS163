ocran
verb: 'to capture the flag in the game Halo without use of a vehicle; to run the enemy's flag to your base.' ; This method of scoring in Halo is named after its creator, Ocran (whose name means 'the disturber' in Hebrew). Ocran would often run the flag to the base rather than driving it, which resulted in players around the globe referring to this technique as 'ocraning' the flag. It is often considered the hardest way to score in Capture the Flag.
