ESRB
Group that was VOLUNTARILY founded by game publishers to reduce the political heat generated by violent games. Does NOT mandate the sales of M rated games to minors, retailers do. The ESRB's flaw is that the panel's of reviewers who watch footage of games are almost entirely non-gamers. Also, the rating levels are a bit hipocritical if you know how to walk the line. ; (Lots of violence can be had in a T rated game, but blood almost certainately guarantees a M rating. Much like the MPAA's hipocracy of rating a film R after the second 'fuck' or when used to mean sex.)
