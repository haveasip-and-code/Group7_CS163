Netdecking
The process of a card for card copying of a winning decklist from a collectible card game that was posted on the internet. If it wasn't posted online, it's not netdecking. ; Clans who do this are usually very intelligent -- they know it's the best way to win. Those who play games for a profit live and die by this.
