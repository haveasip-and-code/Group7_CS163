public restroom
Restroom avaliable for public use. Found in stores, schools, government buildings, etc. Some are OK, but many smell to high heaven, never have enough toliet paper or soap (heh, so much for sanitation), and (especially in the case of high school bathrooms) have tons of graffiti scrawled everywhere. Also are a good place to find people getting high, throwing up, or just hiding from life.
