protest warrior
A group of both liberals and conservatives who fight against slanderous protests, such as the claim that this war in Iraq is illegal and unjust. Often seen armed with permits, video cameras, and sarcastic signs to protest the real lies being fed to otherwise uninformed people. Peace groups being infiltrated are often harrasing the members of the Protest Warriors, seeing them as a threat to debunking their lies.
