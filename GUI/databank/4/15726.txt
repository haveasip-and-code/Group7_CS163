cunt-act
An act that is not only cunt-like, but somehow, ineffably goes against all the principles of mateship that we currently abide by. It implies a selfish inconsideration of others, and perhaps.... yes, an active ill-will in some cases. When uttered, 'cunt-act' (or 'cunts-act') is often accompanied by a mournful shake of the head.
