the smoking kills
What? You haven't heard of them? The Smoking Kills is the sweetest band ever to come outta Toronto, yep. With Double-Ben action on gee-tars, and Can on drums, they will most certainly blow your ears off with musical sweetness. Hold your breath for the album, but if it doesn't come within an hour, you can forget that.
