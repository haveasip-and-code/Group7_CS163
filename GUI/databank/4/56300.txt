Term relating to an individual, though mostly woman, who carelessly end relationships and marriages, takes as much loot as they (she) can get, moves out, returning to live in her parent's home. Term can only be applied to individuals who have demonstrated such behaviour at least twice. (2 divorces,etc.) Terms also lends the air of the individual appearing to be saveable, when in fact, they are childish, materalistic victim and now 'damaged goods'.
