Terri Schiavo
A poor woman who has unfortunately been brain-damaged and subsequently ended up in the bed-ridden situation that she is currently in and has been in for over a decade and a half. However, this does NOT mean that she is useless! This is apparently what [Michael Schiavo] and the many [liberals] who choose to back him up see though. In addition, they also believe him when he says that Terri told him that she wanted to die. ; What millions of people, especially they who follow Michael Schiavo, fail to realize is that there is no written will or recorded message confirming that this is what she ordered to have done. Think about this: if Terri Schiavo REALLY wanted to die, why would she still be alive and holding on to life like she is right now for 10 FULL DAYS? This woman is obviously fighting for her life; her Right To Live! This is all happening while Michael is fighting for her so-called 'Right to Die'. The proper term would actually be more like 'Free me from my Disabled Wife', or even 'Give me a Claim to Fame'. I hope that all Christians and ANYONE who cares about this woman's right to live to pray and protest with all your heart, and never quit until she is gone, IF she goes that is. That is because we hope for a successful resolution for life in our favor, and if so, the right decision was made.
