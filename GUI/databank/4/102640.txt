Fussyhole
A typical insult, generally used in disbelief at someones actions, behaviour or overall personality - think Paul Danan from Celebrity Love whatever! ; No real origin other than that person is (or is being) a 'fussy hole'. ; Can be used generically to insult people like words such as [muppet], [twat] or [dickhead], with the bonus that its not a bona-fide swearword so can be used almost anywhere at anytime.
