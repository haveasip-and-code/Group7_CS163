1.Overplayed. starts as a good song, then gets played so mercilessly by sad dj's (think westwood) trying to be cool that u become so sick of the song u never want to hear it again. ; 1b. Song featured on every r'n'b compilation for the next 5 years. take a look in your local record store and you'll see what i'm on about
