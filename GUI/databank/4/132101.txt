Chi-zzit
A word implied by ignorant idiots who think that they can make up for their lack-of-life by using extremely moronic slang to replace famous swearwords. People who say this are generally using the word as a cry for help. 'Help me! I'm a buffoon who doesn't know proper grammar! Somebody shoot me now!'
