new deal
A scheme in which they decide to throw jobseekers on promising them the land of hope and glory only to realise that the entire thing is an utter waste of time. ; The most mind numbing, soul destroying part of new deal is 'Gateway To Work' which should really be named 'Gateway To Hell' in which they force you to endure two weeks of learning to write a CV and learn interview techniques which can be easily done over a few days. Even worse is the silly team building games and the reasons why people are out of work including that the are drug users. Even before the end of the course you have a great urge to either slit your wrists due to boredom or jump out of a building window hence the reason the windows are painted shut.
