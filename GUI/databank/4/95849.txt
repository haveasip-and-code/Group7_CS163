Shotty
Derived from the word 'shotgun' where the person who calls it gets the front seat in the car. Instead of using this only on driving in a car the word may be used to call 'dibs' on something or doing something first. Also can be used as 'shotty not' where it gives rights to a person not doing a specific task.
