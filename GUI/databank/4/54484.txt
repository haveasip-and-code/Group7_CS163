thurr
This word was derived from both middle english and contemporary jive talk. The -thu comes from the old 'thou' which is, of course, 'you'. The -rr is added in modern english to complete the word. Altogether the word 'thurr' means 'I like your place right there', referring to a specific body part, usually the abdominal area of a female.
