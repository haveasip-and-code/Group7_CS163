Megadeth
the best metal band... correction, best band in the universe. lead by Dave Mustaine, megadeth kicks more arse then anyone or anything. Dave was kicked out of metallica, but look at him now, Metallica fucked up bad with St.Anger and Megadeth released probably the best heavy metal/metal album of all time; the system has failed. too bad mustaine got rid of Ellefson and Friedman and Menza, those guys kicked soo much arse, but James Glenn and Shaun still kick arse
