loop
An [audio] or [video] [digital] [sample] cut so that it plays continuously without jarring. (Nobody uses [analogue tape] or [film] anymore, unless they're into [masochism]) ; Often: 'drum loop' ~ a pattern of [drum hits] which, when combined with a [bassline], make a [groove]. These can be stored as an [audio file] or [MIDI] information.
