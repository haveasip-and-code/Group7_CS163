Coke and Toothpaste
A game played by two people (generally both male) involving a tube of any brand mint tooth paste and several cans of coke (at least 12). The game is played by first holding a medium amount of toothpaste in your mouth at full strength for as long as you can stand the minty burn. After 20 seconds, you spit it into a cup and take a big swig of Coke. This produces a horrible taste in one's mouth and is the object of the game: Who can last longer with that horrible combination. The winner if the one who does NOT give up.
