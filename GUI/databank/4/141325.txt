Black Album
The name that many artists and bands have decided to name their album. Some of the artists to have given one of their albums this title are: ; Jay-Z ; Prince ; The Damned ; Boyd Rice ; Metallica fans also refer to their self entitled album as the Black Album due to its nameless cover and to symbolise the beginning of the end. ; Ira Peel hasn't looked at the [Music Fan Reaction List]. A Metallica fan wouldn't cry because someone insulted their favourite album with such a poor insult. ; BTW The Metallica album wasn't called 'The Black Album' so Jay-Z didn't steal it. You're thinking of his beats. ; I am using this definition to hurl abuse at everyone else that has posted whether than describe the term. I am just like everyone else on this site. I'm cool for once unlike school!
