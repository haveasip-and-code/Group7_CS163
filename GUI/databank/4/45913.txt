spotting
A unique way of smoking marijuana. Put two kitchen knives on a stove/oven/something really hot. You warm the knives up until they're very very hot, then you get both the knives (Make sure to wrap the part of the knife where you'll be grabbing it. Then, Get a little glob of weed, preferably about 1/2 of a bud then make sure it sits/sticks to one knife then crunch the weed with the flat part of both the knives, this should produce a large amount of smoke. Make sure theres a cut bottle for the smoke to raise into, then when its full, suck all the smoke out.. Its probably one of the strongest ways of getting high. ; There maybe other definitions to this way of smoking it, but this is the name used in New Zealand.
