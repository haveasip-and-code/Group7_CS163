Snake
Slang tearm used by skaterboarders at skate parks or skate spots. Normaly skaters have an unofficial 'line' that you are waighting in to skate a certian spot, The skaters may not be in an actual line but take notice of who they go after and who has already gone, etc. ; A snake is someone who continously skates with out giving others a chance, or skates an obsticle, pool, ramp, or rail while another skater is already skating it. ; Often times snaking is done by experianced and impatient skaters using it as an attempt to clear the area so they have it to them selvs. Other times a 'crew' will come in and snake everyone to try and clear the pool / park / ramp so that the members of the 'crew' can skate it. ; Snaking can also be done by accident as it is easy for 2 skaters to accidently drop in at the same time.
