emulator
A program that causes your computer to act like a video game system or different computer. As said before, the emulator itself is perfectly legal, but the ROMs are not, UNLESS you own the physical incarnation of said program, which is not a problem with some of my Atari games, but these laws are illogical anyway. Seriously, I could hook the system up and play the game any time I want.
