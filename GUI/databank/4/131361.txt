im just tired
This is THE answer if someone accuses you of being high or drunk. generally used when one's eye's are a bit of a give-away, or when one is on the [nods]. I believe the unspoken strategy of people using this excuse is that if enough addicts us it while showing symptoms similar to drowsiness, they'll fool everyone. ; Wether or not this excuse works, depends on the experience of the accuser with addicts, drunks, etc. This probably won't work with a cop. It may work with a shelter worker, depending on how naive they are. It probably will work on your parents, providing it's late, and they're chumps.
