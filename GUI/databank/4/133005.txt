project 86
An awesome Christian hardcore rock group. It has four members who have stuck by it from the beginning, even though their names have changed now and then. ; They have four albums (in chronological order): ; Project 86 ; Drawing Black Lines ; Truthless Heroes ; Songs to Burn Your Bridges By ; The best album is Truthless Heroes, which has an almost cult like following in the undergroud that completely transcends the bands popularity. ; And whoever said that the latest album was the hardest needs to check what's in their crack pipe, because as with almost every hardcore band, the first album was the hardest. Drawing Black lines probably ties with Songs for the tamest album, but neither are by any stretch mellow.
