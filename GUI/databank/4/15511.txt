fair-mace
Adjective and intransitive verb: A regular mace is an incident in which 2 people are involved in a theft, and one person steals an item belonging to the second person. However, if the person responsible then proclaims loudly and confidently: 'Fair mace!!', then the theft is allowed under a verbal contract and renders dispute, or argument, irrelevant and impossible.
