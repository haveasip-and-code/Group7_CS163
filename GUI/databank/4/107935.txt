nicemodernism
Nicemodernism is, at its core, a rejection of the post-modern refusal to take a positive stand. Rather than blithely accept the hipster paradigm that 'cool' may be measured only by semantically null snobbery and arcane knowledge, the nicemodernists strive for a self-actualized understanding of what makes them happy. Nicemodernists reject the negativity and self-denying deconstructivism spawned by the pervasive fear of the Cold War era in favor of a delightfully clever Weltanschauung of self-love. Thus, there is no set style of dress or list of bands by which nicemodernists may be identified, but only an attitude of personal responsibility for one's own happiness. In a sense, it may be considered a modern outgrowth of Epicureanism tempered by the pressures of modern urban life.
