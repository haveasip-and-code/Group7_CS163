Nuriel
no matter how bad things may be in your life, every time you see him a smile always finds a way to spread across your face. he is the type of guy who always makes you laugh but never makes you cry. every second you are with him you are either smiling or laughing because he just has that affect on people. he is the most amazing guy i have or will ever meet. not only is he amazing, but he is a genius--he is the smartest guy i know. he may be dorky (which apparently is a complement), but thats one of the many things that i love about him. he isnt just any dork--he is MY dork. the second you are forced to leave his side you miss him, for when you are around him you feel complete. when you are apart, you feel like part of you is missing. if you ever find any guy as amazing as nuriel, you should make sure u get him before anyone else does because you dont find guys like this every day.
