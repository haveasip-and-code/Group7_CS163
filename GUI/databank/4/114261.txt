small blind
The first forced bet in Texas Hold 'Em poker and other similar poker games. The small blind is generally equal to one-half the minimum bet rounded up to the nearest chippable value (e.g. with 100/500 chips, and [big blind] equal to 500, the small blind would have to be 300 instead of 250).
