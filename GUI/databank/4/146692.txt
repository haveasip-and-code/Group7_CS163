Young Earth creationism - the belief that the word of the Bible, or any similar holy book, is literal and that the world was created in about six thousand years. This belief basically says that any testable data showing that the world is older than six thousand years is wrong. Frequently deals with faith more than science, and when science is invoked, it is typically misused or misinterpreted. ; 3. [intelligent design]
