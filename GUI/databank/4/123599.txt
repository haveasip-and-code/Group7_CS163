Springtime for Hitler
The most politcally incorrect show tune ever. The whole basis comes from the miscal 'The Producers' by Mel Brooks. the Plot is that two play producers try to make a Broadway flop so they can collect on all the sponsorship money. The produce the play 'Springtime for Hitler' and the play turns out to be a hit.
