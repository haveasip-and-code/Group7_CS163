Kira Yamato
Kira Yamato is the civilian who soon becomes the pilot of the GAT-X105 [Strike Gundam]. He is not afraid to cry, risks things too much, and isn't afraid of screwing up. Later, he becomes the pilot of the legendary [Freedom Gundam], and defies all laws of physics to save the day. He then gets the [crap] beaten out of him by [Shinn Asuka]. He later pilots an awesome Gundam which doesn't add up to laws of gravity, physics, or plain common sense: the [Strike-Freedom].
