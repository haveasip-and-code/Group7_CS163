schaum
The haircut now chiefly known as a 'mullet', although the term 'schaum' predated it by several years. Can be used with various prefixes: feather-schaum, mexi-schaum, etc. Origin of the word: it's a shortening of 'a Schaumberg', which is a direct reference to the city of Schaumberg Illinois, where such a haircut was predominant in the early 90's.
