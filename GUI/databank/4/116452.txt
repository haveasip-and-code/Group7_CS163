faux punk
Bands that MTV pushes on teenagers in the hopes that they can gain some credability. Usually catergorized by wearing too much eye make-up, having funky hair colors, and overall trying to basically look [punk]. They are pure image and nothing else, and using them to make yourself sound punk really is quite stupid.
