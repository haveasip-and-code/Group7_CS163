highland park
highland park is a city just outside the boundaries of Dallas. Most nice houses are in Highland Park, Some nice are in University Park. These places are both considered 'the bubble' but we only get the rep from our parents. The kids aren't rich.... Just their parents. The moms are plastic dolls that gossip about eachother any chance they get. The fathers are the main money makers, unless the parents are divoreced (very common). But Kids in Highland Park and University Park aren't rich... just their families. Don't hate game.... hate the player
