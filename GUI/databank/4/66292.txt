dumb nice
1. A phrase often used by the late Big L of D.I.T.C. to describe a verbal rhyme style so good, it is without question and you'd be an idiot to doubt it is true, so remain as someone who doesn't speak in opposition to such a fact. ; 2. A person of tact and wit who always has something fresh and appealing to say, but is otherwise quiet and on the humble.
