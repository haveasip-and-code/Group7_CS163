pimp-my-ride-uk
An absolutely disturbing programme found on MTV late at night so as not to scare little children! As an Englishman, I feel a great burden has been placed on my shoulders, having to live with this disgusting display of English folk (again) trying to copy Americans! Don't get me wrong, I do actually like Pimp My Ride(USA). But Westwood? Please MTV, get rid of this cack!
