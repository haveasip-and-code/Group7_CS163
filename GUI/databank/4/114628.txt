Cheese Whack
Cheese whacking is something that only can be by men who are well endowed. It entails removing one's penis and smacking it on a solid surface - normally a table. A really good cheese whack will not only make a half decent noise it will also leave a [knobcheese] stain on the surface in question. ; Cheese whacking can have several meanings. Normally it means 'look at my cock, isn't it big'. However, it can also take the form of abusing an inanimate object, such as a computer.
