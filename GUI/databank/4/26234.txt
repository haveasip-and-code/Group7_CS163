pop music
Pop music- n. Music that is, as the name suggests, popular among music listeners. Pop(ular) music can be anything really, dance, hip hop, rock, etc. Pop music also varies from country to country, and can be considered to vary even in different areas (what's popular in Midland, Texas may not be as popular in London, for instance...heck, they may even be the same sometimes, who knows). Popular music is not really a genre, but rather any kind of music that is spinning round and round the minds of consumers.
