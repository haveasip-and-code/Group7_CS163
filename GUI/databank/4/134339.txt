ice rap
A derogatory term for mainstream rap and 'hip-hop'. Songs in this genre define themselves as truly hip-hop when they are far from it. Rhymes consist mostly of talking about money, hoes and rims - boasting tracks basically, but they fail to pull it off quite as well as the likes of Run DMC due to ALL of their songs being FULL of the same subject. The complete opposite of [backpack] rap.
