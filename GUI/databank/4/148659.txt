wongmo
1. v. This word was birthed when an amazingly sextraordinarily saucy female stated that she would rape anyone who could speak in a voice resembling that of a Bill Clinton, and the male with whom she was conversing proceeded to respond, well, I can speak in voice just like Clinton's. So, 'Oh my God, NOW'. ; The astute and analytical female proceeded to mention how OMG NOW backwords says 'wongmo'; raping a personally solely because they have a voice much like that of the late President Clinton is a backward concept; thus, it follows, that the anacronym is pronounced 'wongmo'. ; To wongmo, essentially, means to rape someone who would be unwilling to be raped were it not for the massive sexual appeal of the raper. And yes, one can be willingly raped, it's a bit like.. hm, well it's like when a person is 'forced' to engage in sexual acts; however, they enjoy the acts, it just allows them to disavow personal responsability if they say that they were forced. Also, it is rape if the '[wongmoer]', if you will, would have engaged in sexual acts with the wongmo-ee regardless of whether consent was issued. ; *Note: wongmoers must have a mad-sexual appeal, that is irrefutable to both genders ; 2. adj. anything that is amazingly or [orgasmically] rad
