Chavroglyphic [Chav] [Scum]
It is literally crappy writing on the streets or on walls in towns which serves little purpose apart from making the street or wall look awfull. Unlike graffiti. ; As in 'chav'. ; An ever-rapidly growing national underclass/sub species of human. Donning nothing else than designer sport wear. ; Caring for nothing more (usually) than cars, brethren chavs and foul attitudes (and the odd pram, which will likely contain a chavling of which the jury is still out as to who is the father). ; A 'chavroglyphic' is similar to graffiti except it is not artistic & impressive. ; It will probably look totally unintelligable to the regualar citizen. ; A 'Chavroglyic' will contain 'glyphs' and other such chav associated slang. Only interpretted by their own crew, rivalling possies or freshly bred chavlings (young'uns). ; Think egyptian 'hieroglyphics', then you got it, hence 'chavroglyphic(s)'.
