Croatia
A country in Eastern Europe. Croatia is fully recovered from the war and ready to come into the European Union. Croatia is a wonderful country, and you can see that by the amount of people coming to Croatia, and moving back to Croatia from the foreing world. My family left Croatia in the war and we came back this summmer. I wouldn't call working and making money here EASY, but life here is better and more enjoyable for me then when I lived in the United States. Plus here, I have much more friends and concerts and places to go out. I LOVE CROATIA!!!
