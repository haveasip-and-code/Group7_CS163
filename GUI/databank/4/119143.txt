girl skateboarder
a true girl skateboarder is one who doesnt skate just to pull boys or too look cool.. or to be like Avril.. a true one is who does it for fun and enjoys what she does.. and doesnt just up when they break a nail or get a grazed elbow... a true one atleast hows how to ollie (or even knows how to ride a board) and knows 10 other skaters rather then [Bam margera] and [Tony Hawk].
