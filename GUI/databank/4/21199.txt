yo-dog
(noun) More politically correct term that red-necks use for the punk-ass thugs who are known to hang out at movie theaters and malls in large quantities and also known to greet each other with 'Yo dawg!'. Males can be identified by the pants they wear around their knees and females of this variety tend to not wear pants (for very long).
