cumberland
A small town in Rhode Island in the north eastern part of the state. Filled with poser white ghetto people who get tatoos such as:the struggle, keep on keeping on, or thug life, even though they live in a white suburbia. However, well known for its outrageous parties and keggers. A great deal of the population is stupid and will never step foot on a college campus unless it is to party or to report to there boss's office. ; One of those towns where if you have half a brain you realize you need to get out of there ASAP.
