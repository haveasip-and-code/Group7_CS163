CRO
An attempt to make Croydon sound vaguely cool by using a bastardisation of the postcode for central Croydon (CR0), which just sounds exceptionally contrived and, frankly, stupid. Especially as the pub with the same name has been closed since mid 2003, having run out of potential new owners. ; It does confuse people making online bookings, though, since they hab itually use an 'O' rather than a '0' when filling out the form, and it won't go through. ; Usually put about by the writers for local fanzine Wired, which is as depressinmg and unjournalistic as you can imagine.
