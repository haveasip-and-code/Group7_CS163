In soviet russia...
Silly internet joke alluding to an episode of Family Guy. The quote from the show was,'In Soviet Russia, car drives you!' The variations of the joke is created by inverting the subject and direct object of a sentence. Often used by postwhores trying to join a conversation with no meaningful input.
