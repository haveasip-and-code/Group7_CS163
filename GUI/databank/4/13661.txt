Risperdal Tits
n. large, vestigial breasts that develop after taking moderate to large doses of Risperdal or any other atypical antipsychotic (Zyprexa, Seroquel, Clozaril...) These breasts are formed by an increase in prolactin production by the mammaries and thus result in the breast enlargement regardless of diet, original bust size, and gender.
