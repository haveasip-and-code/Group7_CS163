Good band consisting of guys and girls! My Japanese isn't too good so I'm not sure about their Jrock songs but their English songs are really good. It's strange that they say they hate hip hop because some of their songs sound like punk rock and hip hop combined but that's just my opinion. The guy and girl vocal combo they have sounds really cool and I've never heard that before. ; Anyone know where to get their other songs???
