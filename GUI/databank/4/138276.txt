choofer
A [pothead], [stoner]; someone who smokes [marijuana] socially. ; These people can often be characterised by attempts to look like cool regular users while wearing their suits with the top button undone and tie loosened, thus dispelling that image and making others think that they should either stick to light beers or just go straight for the [cocaine]. ; Thanks to former Australian Labor Party leader Mark Latham and his ranting and raving against politics and politicians, where he claimed that [marijuana] is the drug of choice in parliament.
