tottenham hotspur
The 'other' team in North London, if you consider Barnet to be a North London team. ; Have a great history and a long list of great players, but are habitually undermined by bad managers, bad luck, bad chairmen, bad referees or a combination of any number of the above. Oh, alright, bad players as well. ; The sort of team that has the players and infastructure to step up into the Top Six of the Premiership, but have suffered several false dawns in the past 25 years to be wary of expecting achievments of note, at least until they win two games in a row, at which point we're edging towards the UEFA Cup with no problem whatsoever, despite the fact we are one of the most inconsistent teams in the country, even when we aren't being screwed out of goals, clear-cut penalties and countless other refereeing decisions each and every seasons, which racks up to the traditional 8-12 placing. Oh alright, and managing to fit in at least three liabilities into the squad, two of which usually in defence. And having Alan Sugar not funding us for the best part of a decade, allowing both Arsenal and Chelsea to overtake us and brag about their five minutes in the sun. ; Easy target for superior Arsenal and Chelsea fans and other glory seekers, and genuine bile from West Ham and Leeds (local rivals 300 miles up the M1, obviously). Still, at least Charlton like us, which is nice.
