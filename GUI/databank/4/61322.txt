bangers and anthems
Interestingly, these two words appear together more often than apart. They refer to the 'feel' of a song of almost any youth genre. 'Banger' refers to a 'club banger' and 'anthems' refer to the songs known to almost everyone from the assiative sub-culture. These terms are both more common in the UK.
