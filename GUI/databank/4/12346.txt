orange county
Orange County is a county in Southern California. It is the suburban sprawl capital of the world, none of the land is left natural, you could sit in traffic for five hours trying to get to big bear....The worst traffic jams on earth, everywhere you drive in orange county, there's no open land, no natural beauty.....
