Preppy Sally
Preppy Sally is based off the phrase [prep-rally]. It was determined that there are two reasons for prep-rallies. A) to watch the 'hot cheerleaders' and the 'jocks' and B) to waste our lives away watching popular people show off. The phrase Preppy Sally was coined as a formal way of saying who the cheerleaders really are that we would watch at the prep-rally. ; Formal way of saying [bitch].
