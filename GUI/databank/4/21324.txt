volunteering
1)The act of giving of yourself to help others. Often followed by a rush of happiness at knowing you've made a difference, but sometimes frustration occurs at going unappreciated or unacknowledged. ; However, many people volunteer tirelessly anyway, not wanting or needing any validation or applause for what they do. ; 2)What many high school students are forced into doing in order to graduate. (In many schools you must log a certain number of volunteer hours to recieve your diploma.)
