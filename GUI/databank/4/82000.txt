RSX
The replacement for the Acura/Honda Integra. This car comes in a slow base model not living up to its 160 hp i-vtec motor, but the type S comes with an i-vtec 200hp motor, one of the fastest non turbo stock 4 cylinder cars. The i vtec makes a distinctive sound change when hitting vtec. Vtec is the shit, and always will be, i drive an old integra and dream of owning this car as do many.
