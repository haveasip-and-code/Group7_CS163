Definitely a cool kid. Although all the girls love him, he doesn't love all the girls. He will play varsity soccer and score tons of goals and be an amazing soccer player so get his autograph now before he is too amazing and forgets all the little people. Goes to Mexico all the time and gets hot girls to like him (one of the Three Eagles that is). Listens to all the cool bands, such as REM, Boston, Fleetwood Mac, and many others. Also he owns all his buddies at Counterstrike Source and Unreal Tournament, and will become a pro CS player and earn tons of money
