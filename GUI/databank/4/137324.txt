NEW ZEALAND: A rather detached maori concept of balancing your life, it's all about the physical, social, mental + emotional, and spiritual balance. In reality, it's just taught at schools in New Zealand to white girls who are forced to take it by the Government. It's a bum subject at school, that is, no one gives a shit if you fail or pass with excellence. It's meant to make you a better person. We have to take it at NZ high school until fourth form, when we can drop it's sorry little ass and go back to our unbalanced but nevertheless much better lifestyles.
