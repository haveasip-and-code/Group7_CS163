Quasadisla
Quasadisla (kwas - uh - diz - luh): ; A new sexual position in which the woman is compacted as much as possible into a spherical state then wrapped around by the guy as much as possible in the attempt to completely eliminate the light of day from reaching the woman, kind of like the pita of a quesadilla prevents the spicy innards from seeing the light of day. Any open orifice is fair game for insertion. The maneuver works best with small, petite women, especially midgets.
