hap
'hap' is a relatively new word, with limited explanation, as i believe to be true: ; 'hap' can be used to decribe something to be like hap, or as hap. ; hap is the right way to do something (like ettiquette), the fast, simple, new, technologically developed way to do something. You could say 'nah, dont send mail by post, use E-mail, its hap' ; hap is a very positive word wit ha lot of uses! ; You could can describe an idea or an object or place as hap too, examples being, (loosely) freedom, a night club or beach, (highly energetic happy environment and atmosphere). ; Hap is also used as a goodbye or pickup expression, to mean well (akin to 'may the force be with you' as may only good things happen for you etc. ; hap = good karma? :)
