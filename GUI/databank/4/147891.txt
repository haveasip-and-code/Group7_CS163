decorpitate
(v.) ; 1. To remove the body from the head. ; (This is more appropriate than [decapitate] because we think of a person as his head. You can cut off my legs, hands, etc. and I will still be me as long as I have my head.) ; 2. To remove the body from any of its parts. ; 3. To remove a head of state from power.
