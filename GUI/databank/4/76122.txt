Screech
1 n. Homemade alcoholic recipe native to Newfoundland Canada, similar to moonshine. Is famous for being extremely strong hooch, mixed often with dark rum and colas. So named for American serviceman who gulped the once nameless bootleg drink in one shot and the resulting throat burn caused him to howl.(from a screech recipe web site)
