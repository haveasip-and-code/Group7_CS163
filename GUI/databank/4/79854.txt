post-rock
In some cases referred to as space rock, a genre of music combining styles of prog, ambient rock, indie, experimental, jazz, psychadelia, and some classical. Often utilizing large bands with diverse instruments including brass, chimes, strings, synthesizers, assorted percussion, and winds, many post-rock bands create a very mellow, atmospheric style of music, often climaxing and making use of tonic/dominant/subdominant patterns in classical music and heavily textured sonic layers. Elements of poetry and science fiction are also often incorperated.
