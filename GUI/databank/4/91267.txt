fanfiction.net
A formerly great site, which hosted a wide amount of stories over a broad choice of categories. As of popular opinion, it is currently a shit pile. It has lazy administration, random deletion of awesome stories and leaves the shit ones behind. Does not fulfil it's motto; 'Unleash your imagination and free your soul'.
