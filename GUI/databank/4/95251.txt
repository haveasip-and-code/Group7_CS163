Horton's Theory of Who
A groundbreaking theory in biology developed by an elephant who saved a bunch of tiny people called 'who'. It states that all psychobiological life systems are diminutive in comparison to a greater, larger life system (life systems become infinitely big). In 'Dexter's Laboratory', Dexter worked with this theory in order to analyze a civilization much smaller than ours.
