chick-fil-a
Restaurant fare comparable to that of McDonalds, and almost equally as scary on a corporate level. Feeding chicken and Born-Again Christianity to the masses, whereas McDonalds spreads 'American' culture worldwide. Chick-fil-a is run by a radical religious zealot responsible for whipping consumers into submission by giving them the fattening foods they've grown so dependent on. And since when is capitalizing on gluttony considered Christian? The whole concept behind the image of the 'protesting cow' was ripped from Peta campaigns -- what a perfect mindfuck. ; Don't give these assholes your hard-earned cash.
