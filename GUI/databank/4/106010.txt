darkman
The act of leaving a social gathering of three or more friends without notice and in a wily, concealed manner. Also, one who practices this art can be referred to as a darkman. The reason for the roughish exit may differ according to the situation: eluding an ex-partner, escaping before being enveloped in a full-blown blackout, evading a cumbersome event, dashing away because the walls are melting and the ceiling is changing colors, etc. The darkman often attempts this foolish exit with a head full of alcohol and/or chemicals, although there are many exceptions to this rule. Any drunken buffoon can attempt a darkman, very few have mastered the true art of the darkman.
