Christian Death Metal
A genre of music that combines the [Death Metal] sound and theme with [Christian] beliefs and morals. Their aim is to praise [Jesus Christ] and the Lord. However, the mixture of these two themes often get mixed up and as a result end up offending the very people they are trying to renew the faith of. ; One of the leading bands from this genre, [Mutilating God's Angels], often offend the priests they want to entertain. An example of this is 'Fatal Whipping of that Jesus Cunt' and 'Watch that Fucker on the Cross die sloowwwllyy'. ; All in all, the only flaw on this genre is that are at least trying to praise god (They say this in all their interviews) and any music that mentions god or Jesus in any way that isn't meant to be incredibly blasphemous should not be heard by impressionable minds in case they become Christian and burn down our science labs. Real music isn't about musical ability or expressing feeling or a message. Music is what you listen to while you're smashing someone's face with a coke bottle. Death to God!
