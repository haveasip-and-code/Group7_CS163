SC8
1. Short for, South Crescent 8, a townhouse at [ St Marys]. ; 2. The coolest place on campus ever to hang out. Home to the supercool sexy-ass ladies Melissa, Amy, Erica, and Angela but always open to their good friends who stop by and visit on a regular basis (e.g. EJ, Kai, Lydia, Matt, Brandon, Becca, Ned, Dusty, Ify, Jordan, Rusty, Christina, Steve, LT, and all the other SC8 regulars). ; 3. Last semester, this place was the Tues. night hotspot for watching 'Laguna Beach.' ; 4. While Laguna Beach is on hiatus, Thursday nights are dedicated to the O.C.
