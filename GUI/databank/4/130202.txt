Arielholic
Fanatics who are hopelessly and sadly addicted to Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid, though they will vehemently deny ever being one. Symptoms of arielholism may include: buying ariel merchandise from eBay, like pillowcases and sheets, knowing all lyrics to all songs from the movie, fetish for seashell bras, etc.
