green eyes
A georgeous and underappreciated eye color. Many blue eyes are beautiful, but many are also very bland and not at all attractive. Brown eyes are beautiful when they are dark, yet so common it takes away the appeal of them, though they are georgeous as well. Green eyes have their own beauty to them and can be very sexy, and in their own way the most beautiful of the three, especially when a deep green.
