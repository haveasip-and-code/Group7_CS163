rift opener
A very skilled magician/sorcerer. These people are very rare, but not nearly as rare as those who have become a [conjunctioner]. Rift openers are powerful enough to be able to open a rift in time and freely travel between any galaxy within outer space and any spacial body therein. They are also able to open rifts between worlds so as to allow [Ancient Ones], [Elder Gods], and creatures of hellish strength and proportion to enter our world.
