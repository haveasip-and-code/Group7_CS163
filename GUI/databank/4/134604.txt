ask a stupid question day
a [holiday] which falls on the last [skool] day in September, usually [September 30th] ; self-explanatory; a day that is celebrated by asking a lot of [stupid question]s, mainly to your teachers/professors ; only funny if you get many people to participate, in which case it can be the most fun and looked-forward-to day of the year ; it is perfectly placed, in that it is soon enough after [summer] that everyone is still sad that summer's over and could use some laughs, yet it is late enough that you have already gotten to know your teachers fairly well, and know the limits to how many stupid questions you can ask them and not get into trouble
