Emo Rangers
A team of super-powered emo kids recruited by a being called Captain Emohead who try to stop the Evil Empress (I don't know who that is either) from taking over Earth. The team consists of: Vicken, the 'Weeping Tears' Emo Ranger; John, the 'Chronic Stoner' Emo Ranger; Ross, the 'Introspective' Emo Ranger; Luke, the 'Chaos Mohawk' Emo Ranger; and Stef, the 'Bleeding Heart' Emo Ranger'.
