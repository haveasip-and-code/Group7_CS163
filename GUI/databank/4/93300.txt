piggy-backing
This is a term used for the concept of when a person unenlightened about club drugs wants to buy ecstasy. Usually the dealer will give them something other than ecstasy that takes longer to create an affect. The uneducated person knows enough to know that ecstasy takes about half an hour to start working. So, once the drug doesnt work within half an hour they will go back to dealer to ask for another pill. The dealer will then give the person another pill of the same kind. This will then kill the person because little did they know that the drug they took was something much stronger (PMA or China White). One of these pills can kill you, let alone two. The dealer does not care because they made their money. ; This whole act of taking one pill and then another right after because of not knowing better and a drug dealer not caring is pigg-backing ; PMA - Even more powerful than Ecstasy. Takes a little longer to take effect. A CAT scan of somebody's brain because of use of this drug showed empty gaps in their brain. ; China White - three pills that look the same as ecstasy and sold as ecstasy. Contains DOB, which is a very potent drug and can easily lead to overdose.
