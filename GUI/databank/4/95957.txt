Jedi Wife Trick
One of the side effects of having your wife watch enough Star Wars - it's an offshoot of the Jedi Mind Trick. A wife performs the Jedi wife trick, by simply saying something to her husband that causes her husband to do her will. It's sometimes accompanied with the hand motion that Obi Wan used on the Storm Troopers in Episode IV.
