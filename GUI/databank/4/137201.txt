moorestown
a popped collar town filled with emo and punk rock wannabees. the girls are all stuck up hoes, study all the time. or play lacrosse and have no time for anything that would resemble a life. theres this hot frosh (big phel's sister) and theres this other cute chick in my history class. i dont know her name-possibly a junior. everyones clothes are from the evil a's/hollister or even worse. girls all have designer bags that cost more than my whole closet. you can always overhear someone saying ' im not rich!!' when really their next door neighbor is jevon kirsch. even the lenola kids arent poor compared to the 'ghetto' of other towns. oh and shut up there is no ghetto in moorestown no matter what you say. everyone is drunk starting friday night and going strong all through sunday. potheads galore as well.
