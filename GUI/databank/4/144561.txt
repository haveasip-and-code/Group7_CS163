Petruccism
A religion founded around one, if not the best, guitarist in the world...John Petrucci of Dream Theater, The Liquid Tension Experiment, and solo career. His hands are one of the fastest and most precise the world has ever seen on a guitar, not to mention he has an amazing amount of natural talent, with a good feel for melody and harmony. See [John Petrucci].
