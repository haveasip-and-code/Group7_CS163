Homophobic
Common term for an explicitly anti-homosexual person. Oftentimes, a self-loathing person confused and frustrated with his latent homosexuality who needs constant reassurance that he's straight. Too dumb to realize that being gay doesn't mean having to be a promiscuous clone of Bobby Trendy who makes annual summer pilgrimages to Fire Island. In these cases, said individual will continue to gay-bash until the second before he comes out of the closet. ; Examples: [Alex Watson], [BS], the [UD Terrorist](s), [Bumkicker Slade], Jeff Gannon, Roy Cohn, Arthur Finkelstein, Axl Rose, etc.
