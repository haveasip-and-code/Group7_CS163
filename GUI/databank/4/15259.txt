haifista
A deep user at [LUE2]; not alot of people truly understand him, most like dismissing him as an idiot or a troll. A user named '[The Apocalyzard]' gave away one of his accounts, which haifista got and started speaking his mind through. Most users liked him under the false account but when they found out it was him they even disliked him more.
