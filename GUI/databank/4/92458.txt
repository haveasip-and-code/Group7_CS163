spin the bottle
A game, usually played with a group of men and women, perhaps in addition to or after drinking, that involves spinning a bottle in turn, and the person who the bottle stops spinning on must kiss the person who spun it. NGK (No Guy Kissing) rules should be applied at all times. If the bottle happens to stop on a guy when a guy spun it, the girl nearest to the stopped bottle must kiss the guy who spun it. Rules against girl-on-girl kissing are unheard of and against nature. [Spin the cell phone] is a modern variation on the game.
