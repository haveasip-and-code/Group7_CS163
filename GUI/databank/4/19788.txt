scroob
It is actually spelled scr00b, with zero's not o's, scr00b is a combination ; of scrub and n00b. A super newbie if you will. It is used for basicly eveyrthing, just like the word fuck! ; This word is generally used in gameing and in online use. But some kids near detrioit michigan use it for everything ;-)
