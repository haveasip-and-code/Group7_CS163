Need some wood?
Definition: ; Question usually posed to an [ass clown] at a point in a conversation or relationship where the [ass clown] has grossly exceeded the limits of patience and tolerance in others who were, up until that point, making every effort to engage the [ass clown] in a civil discussion or relationship and indicating that the [ass clown] now runs the risk of unleashing a wrath previously withheld. The target of such a question is being informed that they have descended into such utter stupidity that their only possible hope of salvation is the application of a hard piece of a tree to the side of their head (for starters.) The phrase is stated rather than asked to indicate that the [ass clown] may be in imminent physical peril. Usage of this phrase is similar to [bam stick] although usually in a calmer tone - such as the phrase 'You asked for it.' ; Background: ; Asked, as if joking, by President George W. Bush of Senator John Kerry during the second 2004 presidential debate at a point where Bush knew a recent reference to timber would confuse his adversaries.
