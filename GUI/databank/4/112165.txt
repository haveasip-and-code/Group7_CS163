extreme chess
Commonly played by drunken fraternity boys in the mid eighties, extreme chess has only become mainstream in the last 2-3 years. Every time you take an opponents piece, you are allowed one closed fisted hit anywhere on that opponents face, while remaining seated. Players must always alternate striking hands, and achieving a 'check' allows for two blows. God forbid you shoule be worked into 'check mate', because that attracts the afformentioned double blow, however from a standing position to inflict maximum degradation.
