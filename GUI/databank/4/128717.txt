fagnificent
Magnificent in such an over-the-top, fabulous manner that the style, widget, or event must have been made fashionable by the livelier sort of gay men, most likely while they were dressed in sequined drag and crooning Yma Sumac numbers. In connotation, 'fagnificent' is markedly more fabulous than 'fabulous' and notably more campy than 'splendiferous.'
