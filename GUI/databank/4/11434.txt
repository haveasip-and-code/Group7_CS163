Nabooru
An utterly dangerous, sexy character in the game 'The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time' who serves as the exalt of the Gerudo thieves and later as the Sage of Spirits. ; Link first encounters her in the Spirit Temple as a child and retrieves the Silver Gauntlet for her. When he finally retrieves them, Nabooru has already been taken away by the evil twin witches, Kotake and Koume, and he must travel forth in time. He meets her again in the form of an iron knuckle whom he must defeat to break the curse. ; As with most Gerudo, Nabooru's characteristics consist of bright red hair, tan skin, a long nose, excessive usage of makeup, and skimpy, revealing clothing that will drive any unsuspecting Hylian man to helplessly submit to the Gerudo's control.
