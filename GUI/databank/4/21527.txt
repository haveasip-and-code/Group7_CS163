kerrang
a magazine/radio station/tv channel that is all about rock music. But i only listen to the radio station (kerrang 105.2) so i'll write about that. ; It does play rock (and hip-hop) and nicely insults busted, which is good. If kerrang play busted or mcfly i will scream. However, it does play some bad songs, like that stupid 'you can do it' song, which i hate with a vengeance. it also plays jay-z. pssh...
