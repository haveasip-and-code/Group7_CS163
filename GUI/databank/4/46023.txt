Circuit City 2AM
It is the popular spot to call people out to fight in order to resolve difference. The kicker in the situation is that there is not going to be an actual fight. While the 'called out (callee)' party shows up expecting a fight, the 'call out (caller)' party hops in the car and begins a jousting competition. There is a chase, followed up by some jousting. It's a hoot.
