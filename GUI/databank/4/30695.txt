Charles Manson
okay people, Charlie Manson wasn't satanist....for christ's sake....he was 'acting on the will of god'...hell...some say he WAS GOD/JESUS...he worshipped god...he just had some messed up beliefs. He supposively ordered the death of Voycheck Frykowski, Sharon Tate, Jay Sebreing,Abigail Folger, Leno LaBianca, and Rosemary LaBianca...also Shorty Shea and Gary Hinneman...note my spelling may be a bit messed up.
