nobody's fault but mine
A really good Led Zeppelin song, like many of their others that is overlooked because of their song 'Stairway to Heaven' which is both fun to play and listen to, but it overshadows their other song of equal greatness. This song goes back to their blues type music, but it was made later on. I'm just trying to get people to look past stairway, it's a lot like edgar allen poe and 'The Raven', it overshadows his other poems.
