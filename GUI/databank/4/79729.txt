Stamford  CT
I love how people bash Stamford,CT for being a 'ghetto' and having lots of diversity. I wonder how Stamford compares to Greenwich when it comes down to kids being raised by nannies because their mothers are to busy getting drunk at Greenwich Country Club. I don't think to much of that goes on in Stamford because unfortunately for us, there is no country club, DARNIT! Yea, our public schools are rough, but we make it through, and we're better people for it. Greenwich HIgh is a joke! The same goes for Darien High, New Canaan High, and all those other surrounding towns who love to 'Stamford and Norwalk Bash' because we have some diviersity. Atleast we're not narrow minded rich kids with nothing better to do then sit around, get drunk, and buy some cocaine with our allowance that Dad gave us on Sunday after church.
