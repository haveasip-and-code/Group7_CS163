The College of New Jersey
While Blee (from New Brunswick, NOT Ewing, where the College is located) makes some good points about TCNJ inflating its image, he makes some broad assumptions that are not really true. TCNJ is a great college for prospective teachers, and is well-connected with schools in New Jersey. The amount of hands-on time you get teaching at TCNJ is great, and is something you won't find many other places (like Rutgers). Like it or not, TCNJ is getting national (not just local) attention. It has been put on the Barron's list of the top 75 most competitive colleges. I don't know about the rest of the faculty, but the music faculty is diverse and knowledgable, and all have outstanding merits. ; That being said, TCNJ babies its students more that most colleges, and the housing situation is not very good for upperclassmen. The administration is practically retarded, and the parties are pretty terrible. The people are largely lame and apathetic, but you will find a sizeable amount of motivated, interesting people. If you are a motivated person you will find TCNJ to be very useful if you don't mind wading through some bullshit.
