Oreo-Pop
A genre of popular music noted for its over-use of affected exaggerated quivery-voiced tremolo singing, often placed in the R & B ctegory nowadays in music award shows and record charts even though it has neither R nor B in it, because it has not yet been given it's own genre-name. While derivative of older Black styles such as Gospel and Motown, it is a formula-pop vocal style which is now used by both whites and Blacks, even crossing over into Latino music, both male and female. As diverse as Mariah Carey, Destiny's Child, Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera.
