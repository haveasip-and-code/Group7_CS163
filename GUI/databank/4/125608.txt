Badger
Slang word created by a late night/early morning taxi driver in reference to the female genetalia. Later used as a chant during Leeds Festival 2005 whenever an attractive female were to walk past the obscure campsite. Also used as a method of finding ones way through the sea of tents to locate the campsite at 2 in the morning.
