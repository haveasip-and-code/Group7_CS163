ocg
Old Cool Gangsta. Can be used as a greeting or as a title. Meaning to be a bad dude in a foul mood. Perhaps this ocg is a playa, or is putting a hate on someone. None the less, he is steet salted with experiences under his belt, stays calm and cool in all situations and has the ability to take care of business if needed.
