Freebirds
Well, there _is_ a chain, but the original is unaffiliated with those and is located in the I.V. area of Santa Barbara. Open goddamned late, and it has a subway style point-at-your-topping, so it's perfect for people too drunk to walk anywhere, let alone order properly. Excellent nachos, and the Monster burrito is about as big as my forearm. ; They need better salsas though. And always get extra cheese. They will heap that stuff on with no additional charge.
