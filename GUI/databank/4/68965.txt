Hey, Choatie, it's great to see how well you create your argument. You start by defining Choaties as 'omnipotent on the field' 'quintessentially flawless' and 'matchless in manners'. And you finish with, 'because the linguist's school has class.' ; Thank you for blatantly lying to all UrbanDictionary readers. ; Facts: ; 2004 Deerfield-Choate Football game~ 29-21 Deerfield ; 2004-05 Deerfield-Choate Hockey games~ ; 4-2 Deerfield; 4-1 Deerfield ; 2005 Deerfield-Choate Lacrosse game~ 13-4 Deerfield. ; Choate must have more manners that Deerfield: running around with one's shirt off, banging on trash cans to excite the student body (mainly non-existent during matches- LOTS of spirit of course at Choate) is absolutely 100% classy. Great manners. You Choaties can't even rack your brains to create your own comeback! 'Deerfieldian, shine my shoes.' Wow, that's completely original, and not at all based off a previous entry under [choatie].
