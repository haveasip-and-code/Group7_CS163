Jesus freak
Jesus Freak: not, as many seem to believe, any christian. most christians are okay. but jesus freaks are in a class of their own. every religion has the fanatics, and the reason christianity has one with a name is because the religion is in the government and ruining peoples lives... ahem. anyway, a jesus freak is a christian who a)thinks anyone who isnt christian is a satanist, b)thinks they have to kill these 'Satanists', c)is a homophobe (if theyre a homophobe because that's what the LORD says...x.x), d)goes around pushing christianity on everyone and tries to 'save' everything thats alive and non-christian, e)puts people down because of what they where or say or listen to if they think its going against the lord or something, and/or f) thinks god will sort the dead out and therefore doesnt care if they or someone else dies.
