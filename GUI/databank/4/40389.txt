Ole Miss
Ole Miss is located in the rolling hills of North Mississippi about 80 miles south of Memphis, Tennessee. The typical Ole Miss student is a good looking Southern girl/guy who enjoys tailgating in the Grove during football season, fraternity/sorority life, and all things preppy. Ole Miss students usually have a deep hatred for LSU and sometimes Mississippi State as well.
