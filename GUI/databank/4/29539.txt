Lout
The lout is commonly found in Bishopbriggs, just outside Glasgow, Scotland. However, louts have been found in other areas also. ; They are known to enjoy tanging. Tanging is a popular pastime for the lout. Tanging involves spending vast amounts of time with Duncan Tang. This time will most likely involve eBaying which is another popular pastime for the lout. The lout enjoys music - and if the correct type of music is being played (the band Strung Out is always a favourite), on rare occasions you may witness the Lout dancing. This rare act is unmissable. ; Although the Lout enjoys the warm climate of such places as TENERIFE (the lout usually holidays there for 2-4 weeks a year) it is especially fond of colder climates and one of it's favourite pastimes is building snowmen. ; The Lout will usually be decked out in some variety of beige clothing and possibly a leather jacket when the weather is colder. ; The Lout will usually feast on delights such as Eccles cake, goats cheese cracker selections, toffee yoghurts and every saturday night the lout will consume a Fish Dinner. Donner meat has also become a favourite food for the lout. ; The lout is fairly active and can be found running about streets, going running with close friends or taking part in rugby (rugger). ; The term lout is closely related but somewhat different from the [bat].
