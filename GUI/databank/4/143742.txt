Spackle Ass
Spackle Ass is the result of many hot, wet farts released over a long period of time without wiping. The person with Spackle Ass may feel as if hot spackle (or glue) has been poured in between the ass cheeks, and is usually very uncomfortable. Spackle Ass also happens while running and farting at the same time, or while holding in a shit for a long period of time. The best remedy for Spackle Ass is a hot shower. If not a shower, then a hot, coarse rag usually helps get rid of the Spackle Ass.
