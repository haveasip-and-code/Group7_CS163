posh spice
A former member of the [Spice Girls] who looks like a long-lost relative of Lara Flynn Boyle. Married David Beckham, then turned him into a [metrosexual] god. She used Beckham to revive her sagging career, which really should have been over a long time ago. Why? Because she has even less talent than [Carrot Top].
