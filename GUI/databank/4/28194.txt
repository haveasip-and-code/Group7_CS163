Death Penalty
A penalty that is given to people who deserve it (i.e. murderers). Many have said that the death penalty is wrong. Yeah, well, I rather a bunch of murderers be executed than have to pay taxes that will support the prisons holding them. ; I'm not particularly sure why, but the main thing usually said to me is 'we have no right to condemn someone to death'. This is the usual reason I hear for not supporting the death penalty, but it's ludicrous. The murderer obviously believes they have the right to condemn someone to death. Are others suppose to be 'above' him and not stoop to his level? Yeah, whatever. Maybe I'm just one of those guys who don't like living alongside those kind of people. ; Of course, many have also critized the Republicans for supporting the death penalty while being pro-life. Um, HELLO? You're comparing the murder of a BABY to the murder of a MURDERER! Notice the difference? Man, King Solomon must be rolling in his grave to hear a bunch of self-righteous assholes say shit like this.
