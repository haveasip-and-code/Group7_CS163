utica
A city in Upstate New York. My grandfather lives there. It is a very Italian town, I think that gives it charecter, but you can come up with your own conclusions about that. Utica is an all american town. For such a small city (about 60,000) it has a lot of interesting things about it, utica sausauge, utica pizza. It's a decent place.
