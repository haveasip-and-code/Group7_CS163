Quina Quen
Fat, weird, ugly looking marshmallow-frog thing from Final Fantasy IX. Yet, Quina still amuses me and makes me have a good laugh. ; Quina is a gluttonous he-she-it that carries an oversized fork around as a weapon. When her, I mean, 'its' trance builds up, she uses a special ablility called 'Cook' to eat her enemies fried. =P
