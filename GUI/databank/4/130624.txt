bling roll
A phrase/food derived from the Asian food spring rolls. A deep-fried type of roll containing in the center of it, any type of crappy leftover food in the back of the fridge that you scrape together. The only people that make this are the southern black people who are so [ghetto fabulous] that they can't afford to buy good food so they live off of that shit.
