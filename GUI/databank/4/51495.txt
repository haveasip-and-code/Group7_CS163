monkey steals peach
A ninja technique. Drop to the right knee, swinging the arms like windmills to deflect any defense the opponent may offer. The left arm is used to block any attacks, protecting the face as you slide foward without stepping. The right arm swings up and back, circling from the shoulder. Turn the palm up as it swings between the enemy's feet to stun him. Whip the arms as described and strike the enemy's groin with the open palm with fingers bent at first joint in a Monkey Paw or Tiger Claw fist. The impact will lift the enemy off the ground. Followers of the Iron Hand styles immediatly clench their fists tightly, with a crushing grip, and jerk the hand sharply back to the near hip, effectively ripping away the genitals. Massive blood loss causes death.
