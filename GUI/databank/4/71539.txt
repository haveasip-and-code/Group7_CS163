Chewonki Foundation
An incredible program in Wiscasset Maine which educates students about wildlife and the environment. There is also a program run by Chewonki for high school juniors for a semester. The semester program brings about 35 juniors from around the country to a tight-knit community in which one lives in cabins and learns about everything environmental and anything which will make life better and more fun. A highly recommended program found at www.chewonki.org
