whoo kid
G Unit's official DJ. If it isn't Whoo Kid, it isn't official. He is known for yelling 'Damn!' or 'Can't forget' in songs for no reason. There are also plenty of random gun shots. The most annoying thing is when there is a gun shot, then he yells 'Damn! Bring that back!' and the whole verse repeats. Still, his tapes are hot!
