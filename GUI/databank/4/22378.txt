The OC Fanatics
Someone has the love of the show, The O.C. Yeh they may be a little obsessive but it's just a show and it really doesn't matter if you have a love of it or not. ; I know many older people who watch the show too, so it isn't just for kids, and certainly not just for girls! ; Also it has a lot of important issues brought up too!
