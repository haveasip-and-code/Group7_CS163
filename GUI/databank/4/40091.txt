Darsh
Used primarily as an insult, the term 'darsh' originally derived from an episode of South Park. In the said episode the character Stan Marsh was on a ski-trip and a random guy challenged him to a race. In an attempt to piss Stan off, the random guy said: 'Stan Marsh... more like Stan Darsh!' And since then all the cool kids have been saying it.
