Ico
A terribly underrated masterpiece of a video game released in 2001 by an in-house Sony development team in Japan. Although it receieved great reviews, it sold terrible because it was not A: Halo, B: Grand Theft Auto, C: Final Fantasy, and D: Did not have any firearms in it and did not appeal to the general gaming population.
