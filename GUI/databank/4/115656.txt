lilspeak
A [dialect] of written [slang] used by [littles], mostly on [chat] and [message board]s. Spelling is extremely phonetic, reflects child-like speech impediments, and may be otherwise incorrect. Grammar is extremely child-like. Comments frequently reflect child-like miscomprehension of others' comments. ; Come to think of it, that describes [ebonics], too.
