hamilton  nj
One of the largest and nicest suburbs in Jersey. Commonly said to be part of South Jerey but this isnt true, we are central, yes there is such a thing, and we are not Trenton, so don't confuse it. Home of the guy who sits on the corner of Mercer St. and Nottingham Way and drinks beer all day long.
