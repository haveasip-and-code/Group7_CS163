power rangers
Pretty okay show teaching kids how to fight evil ; Basic formula of the show goes like this: ; 5 people sitting together at the ice cream parlor, then suddenly danger strikes!,go to their head quarters to find out what's wrong, MIGHTY MORPHIN' TIME!!!, Find and fight the bad guys, henchmen are killed 'the Boss' barely survives, the power rangers find 'the boss the second time', they continue where they left off, when 'the boss is barely able to fight anymore' he injects steroids into his system and becomes a giant, forcing our beloved power rangers to hop in thier equally large machine fighters, blah blah blah, bad guy is defeated, bad guy screams in pain, creator dude gets all pissed off, and everyone goes back to the ice cream parlor...
