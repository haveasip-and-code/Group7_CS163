speak of the devil
Someone appears after you mention them. 'Speak of the Devil' is short for 'Speak of the Devil and he shall come'. It was believed that if you spoke about the Devil it would attract his attention. That's why when you're talking about someone and they show up people say 'Speak of the Devil'.
