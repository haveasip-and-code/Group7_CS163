Habbo Credits
Currency used on the famous Habbo Hotel. You can buy them on house phone (for the sneaky kids who put it all on their parents' phonebills) by text message (this is the method the Habbo Hotel staff use to recieve the money, send back a code in which the child can type into a hard-to-find box on the Hotel, press a button, and gain some credits. By this time the child has either forgotton the code and deleted the text, or forgotton what to do altogether) or Splash Plastic (for the peadophiles who remain the only ones who bother using this).
