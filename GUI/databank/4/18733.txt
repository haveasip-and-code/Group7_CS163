RAF
The Royal Air Force, second to none. Generally considered as second to the USAF due to having less planes, but as they say: it's not how big it is, it's how you use it! ; Of course, being able to determine the difference between allies and enemies is always an asset that the RAF have had, whereas certain other Air Forces consider anything on the ground to be fair game.
