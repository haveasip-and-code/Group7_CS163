cannabis
An herb which is usually smoked to get high. Symptoms include: short-term memory loss, hightened senses, creativity, hunger, general well-being, and in some cases, hallucinations. ; Cannabis has basically no negative side-effects except mental addiction in few cases. Unlike what someone else said, YOU CANNOT DIE FROM SMOKING CANNABIS. There have been absolutely no deaths from only cannabis. I know someone who smoked 12 bowls of it in one night and just passed out drooling on the floor. ; Better than alcohol because you don't get a hangover, and plenty of people can drive very well when stoned.
