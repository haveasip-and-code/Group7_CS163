NASCAR chicks
(noun) [NASCAR] chicks are women and girls who often are involved in the sport due to the sexyness of the drivers. They also enjoy the loud noises caused by the engines, and don't mind being proud about they're being a NASCAR fan. However, do not refer to these fragile creatures as rednecks, for they can become angered and violent. Their natural habitats include trailers, ingrounds, grandstands, and, on rare occasions, homes in the city (these species are endangered). They can drink any other girl under the table, and aren't afraid to kick ass!
