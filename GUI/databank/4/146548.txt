fantabuloso
An adjective given to describe something that is both fantastic and fabulous, but with a Spanish twist to it so the speaker sounds smarter than he or she actually is. It is said with a rhythm to it i.e. fantabu-lo-so, or with a posh accent i.e. fantabuloso, dahling. ; Alternatively, it can be used as a pun to describe the taste of a common fizzy drink.
