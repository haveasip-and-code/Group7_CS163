afrikaaner
Ok some people here are getting confused... Im south african so I know what Im talking about, An afrikaaner is an Afrikaans person, an afrikaans person is someone who talks afrikaans. Black south africans and white south africans that dont speak afrikaans are not afrikaaners. Afrikaaners are the ones that came up with the idea of apartheid, not the english south africans or the blacks. So people in south africa who arent afrikaans and you call them that will get really offended so I advise you not to.
