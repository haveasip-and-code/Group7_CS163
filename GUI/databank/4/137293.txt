World War II
The Americans did not single handedly win the war. Maybe the naval war, but how about the Russians at Starlingrad destroying the German Eastern Front? How about Montgomery in Africa? Just a little naieve to think that the whole of World War II was won in 2 battles by the Americans. Also, you ignored the War until it became a threat to you and you thought GB might fall. I assume you just learnt about those 2 battles in history today? Maybe you'll do the other bits later in the semester
