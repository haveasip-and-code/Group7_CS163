the ramones
The Ramones were a hugely influential punk rock band, formed in Forest Hills, Queens, New York in January 1974. They played their first concert at the Performance Studio in New York on March 30, 1974. They led the New York punk movement and are often credited with forming the musical foundation of punk (see protopunk). The original band members all adopted Ramone as a surname although they were not actually brothers: ; Joey Ramone (May 19, 1951 - April 15, 2001) (real name Jeffrey Hyman) (vocals) ; Johnny Ramone (October 8, 1948 - September 15, 2004) (real name John Cummings) (guitar) ; Dee Dee Ramone (September 18, 1952 - June 5, 2002) (real name Douglas Glenn Colvin) (bass guitar) (1974-1989) ; Tommy Ramone (January 29, 1952) (real name Thomas Erdelyi) (drums) (1974-1978) ; Later band members also adopted the name: ; Marky Ramone (July 15, 1956) (real name Marc Bell) (Later replaced Tommy and Elvis on drums) (1978-1983, 1987-1996) ; Richie Ramone (August 11, 1957) (real name Richard Reinhardt) (Later replaced Marky on drums) (1983-1987) ; Elvis Ramone (November 24, 1955) (real name Clem Burke) (Later replaced Richie on drums) (1987) ; C.J. Ramone (October 8, 1965) (real name Christopher John Ward) (Later replaced Dee-Dee on bass) (1989-1996) ; An earlier member, Ritchie, left the band before the first recording (not related to the Richie Ramone, above). 'Here lies Ritchie Ramone' can be seen on a cartoon drawing of a gravestone on the innersleeve of the 'Rocket to Russia' album ; Colvin (Dee Dee Ramone) suggested the name, inspired by the fact that Paul McCartney used to call himself Paul Ramone (although some accounts say Paul Ramon) when he was in the Silver Beatles. ; The Ramones pioneered a straightforward, stripped-down sound that was a far cry from the virtuosic musicianship and complex instrumentation that 1970s rock music had become known for. It heralded a raw, loud, fast and direct sound often reminiscent of 1950s-early 1960s rock and roll or bubblegum pop. Joey Ramone has stated the Ramones were rather taken with the Bay City Rollers' hit song 'Saturday Night,' and set out to imitate its catchy, sing-a-long quality.
