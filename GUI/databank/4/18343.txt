Violent Tom
Probably originated from Haverhill. Refers to an unneccessary violent act and person. We question where Tom's violence was first shown - scientists believe that it was in the English computers when he smacked the Big Gay Bear (also in the dictionary) in the face - subsequently, the bear mauled violent Tom to the ground.
