sticky wicket
A term that aludes to a situation in which a person is in trouble. Comes from cricket where on uncovered wickets after a short rainfall a pitch could dry into a 'sticky' which could make it extremely difficult to play on as the ball would be going anywhere. Not anything to do with sex R.munkey. Where the fuck you from?
