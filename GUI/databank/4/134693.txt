cardiac hill
Cardiac Hill, the end of all good xc runners on long island. if you can run up cardiac, u must be god. it composes of three steep parts, seperated by two parts that arnt as steep. of course, there are sand pits in the non steep parts, including the foot of the hill. in the steeper parts, there are rocks and roots. finally, when you reach the top, you still have one mile of the race left...isn't that great?
