munroe day
'munroe day' is a nonplus made by University of King's College students to the actual 'Munro Day' celebrated by Dalhousie University. Munro Day was originally celebrated by Dalhousie to commemorate George Munro's monetary contributions to the university in its time of near banruptcy in the late 1800s. When the two universities joined, King's was to adopt all of Dalhousie's holidays, but since King's is a bunch of pompus ass's, they decided that they'd make up their own little secret holiday where little King's students run naked in the Quad in tribute to their mad king.
