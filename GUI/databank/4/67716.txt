ass-balunker
taken from the chinese proverb-' if your chicken will not fry its probably because you are a rice, piece of shit, ass-balunker'- its used as a tail end of most insults which have you noticed have all started with 'gay-ass' or '-ass' of some sort? o and by the way it means you either suck at life or toss old-people's salad.
