hummus
A dip/spread (commonly eaten on [pita] bread) made from mushed chickpeas, garlic, and lemon juice. Believed to have originated in the Middle East, it is popular in America with vegetarians and college students (no one else seems to know it exists.) It's quite good, and has a nice zing to it--delicious with lime tortilla chips. ; Also spelled [humus] (one [m]), although this spelling can also refer to decaying plant or animal matter. When writing appetiser menus for formal banquets (especially those banquets including guests familar with horticulture), it is probably best to stick with H-U-M-M-U-S. (Though you must admit, H-U-M-U-S is bound to get a priceless reaction or two.)
