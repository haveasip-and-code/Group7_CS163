queens
One of the 5 boroughs of The City of New York. Virtually impossible to get around without a car. Despite being exceedingly large, is mainly devoid of subway transport and reliable bus transport. An economically diverse area, though the changes are gradual, there is a sharp contrast between sets of not too far away neighborhoods. Shares south boarder with Brooklyn.
