Pheonix Hunter
A strong man that hunts any bird including the legendary Pheonix, he is only able to knock down The Pheonix when the Pheonix is distracted or in other words the 'Pheonix Hunter' casts an illusion that puts visions into the Pheonix's mind about the past. The Pheonix, helplessly cannot forgive the unforgetable, emberassing, and humiliating past. The Pheonix Hunter then whips out his primary weapon, 'The Hybrid Harpoon.' Then he must do a thrust so swift to break The Pheonix's Mighty Barrior Skin.
