Thanks for this. I've done my job really well if you're this pissed off. I posted those definitions back in December because most of the definitions for UCLA consisted of insulting bullshit posted by USC students. A lot of those old definitions have been taken off of the site, but some are still there. It's nothing personal. But if you bash my school, then there's no way that I'm not going to bash yours. ; And what did I post in my definitions? I posted proof that UCLA is better than USC. US News rankings, London Times Rankings, total NCAA championships...none of that is made up. You can look it up for yourself. Maybe the truth is too much for you. ; As for not having a life, I posted those definitions back in December and I hardly use this site. Meanwhile, you're also using the site to post definitions. Pot, kettle, black. ; As for the anti-USC definitions, a lot of them come from South Carolina students. They're not all Bruins. Maybe you just have to come to grips with the fact that a lot of people, even non-UCLA people, hate the University of Southern California.
