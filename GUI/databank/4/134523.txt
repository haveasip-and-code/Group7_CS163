great neck middle
a middle school located in virginia beach. the, so you could say, younger generation of cox high. it is more clique-oriented than any other school i've seen. it's amazing how anyone survives it. if you're not popular, you're nonexistant. there are about ten girls who 'rule' the school.. the boys' purpose is to hook up with the girls and look pretty. great neck is home to the rich kids of virginia beach. every girl owns at least one designer purse and every guy, more than enough surfboards. if you go there, you'll probably hear 'oh, you're rich.' as a past student, i would know.
