waffle goth
You know those weird gothic kids who hang out at places like Waffle House, IHOP, and Denny's in the wee hours of the morning? That's exactly what I'm talking about. See, a friend and I recently discovered exactly WHY goths are so attracted to these places. ; 'WAFFLES. THEY'RE SO FUCKING SPOOKY. Why didn't I see it before?! I mean, have you ever looked at one of those mofos? Pure. Anguish. Their brief lives are pain. They've been simmered in a hot pan or iron quite possibly burnt, only to be consumed by the consumer MACHINE, yo.' ; Waffles are therefore obviously a symbol of gothic culture.
