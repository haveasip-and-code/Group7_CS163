HP/DM
A classic pairing within the [Harry Potter] [fanfiction] world. This is a shortened term for [Harry Potter] [/] Draco Malfoy. This is put in the story's summary to indicate that the characters come into a romantic situation together. This is a very popular pairing in fanfictions because of the angst and hatred that builds up between them. It makes for a very good plot and WAS very original way back when people were only up to the second book.
