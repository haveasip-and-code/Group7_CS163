Eye of Sauron
Basically, it is the moment when you are about to come and should be pulling out while having unprotected sex. Statistically, about 99.8% of males do not know when to pull out and get 'spotted' by the Eye, resulting in unwanted pregnancies and general bad attitude from their ladyfriend.
