mapinguari
A terrifying, red-haired, giant sloth with backwards feet and armadillo-like claws living in the Amazonian rainforest - stands over 6 feet on hind legs. It emits a foul stench and a spine-tingling howl that instills permanent fear and panic to one who hears it. Is said to rip skulls off humans and suck out their delictable brains as well ripping apart palm trees for the insides. Ancestors of the mapinguari roamed the Americas, the Caribbean and Antarctica.
