westport
A very rich town. A place that has huge mansions luxury cars lining the streets and celebrity residents that just seem to blend in. The kids in the town are oblivious to the real world. There are two high schools in the town Greens Farms Academy (for the very rich kids) and the public Staples High School (for the run of the mill rich kids). Staples has a stick so far up its academic ass it can't even bend over. A Westport night for kids consists of getting drunk or stoned going to a house party the cops showing up then everyone goes down to the beach. Basically, the town is uptight and I would advise not moving here if you don't like to compete with everyone else.
