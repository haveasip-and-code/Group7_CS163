F1
The richest and most watched sport in the world. More technologically advanced than any other form of motorsport. ; Some idiots think they use ABS brakes, stability controls, turbo/superchargers, etc. which is not true. People who think this are usually American and are trying to talk up the likes of IRL and Nascar, both inferior to F1 in every area (Nascar drivers can't even do one race without crashing into each other...). ; There's also only two tyre suppliers (not 4 as some idiots have said here), Michelin (who are currently dominating the sport) and Bridgestone. ; Engine companies involved in F1 are Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Toyota, Cosworth, Honda and Renault (Yamaha and Fiat are not involved, although Fiat does own Ferrari). ; The teams spend a combined total of over $3 billion on the development of the cars each year, and still make a profit from the sport.
