all your base
Some stupid internet phenomenon that has geeks across the country drooling with amazement at some bad grammar. The common geek inserts the phrase 'all your base' into any random posting on a website, and therefore thinks he is cool. It originated from some bad Japanese translation in a Videogame called 'Zero Wing'. People thought this was amazing, and started saying all your base all the time. See [pwned] and [numa numa].
