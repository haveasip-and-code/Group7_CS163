Dante Sparda
The wisecracking half-man, half-demon star of the ass-kicking game series [Devil May Cry]. He is the son of Sparda and the brother of Vergil Sparda. He owns a demon hunting agency called Devil May Cry (duh), of which he is sole owner, employee, and agent. he traditionally carries a large broadsword (Examples: Rebellion, Sparda Sword, Force Edge, Alastor) and two .45 caliber pistols, one black and one white, called Ebony and Ivory, which never run out of ammo. However he has been known to carry other weapons, such as an icy three-sided nunchaku/flail, two scimitars, fiery gauntlets, even an electric (literally) guitar, as well as a full compliment of firearms, from lasers to sniper rifles, to rocket launchers. Again, none of these run out of ammo. ; Dante is a bit full of himself, and for good reason. His half demon heritage gives him phenomenal strength, speed, agility, and healing abilities, to the point where he can get impaled multiple times and still lay down a good ass-kicking. While he normally takes on a human form, he has the ability to use a 'Devil Trigger', which makes him stronger, faster, take less damage, and just more badass in general for a short period of time. He is constantly at odds with the legions of Hell which his father locked away and his brother, Vergil, who is thought to have been killed. He has a large red jewel around his neck that is the only thing he has left of his mother, who was killed by demons when was young (thus inspiring him to become a demon hunter).
