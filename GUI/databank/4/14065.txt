noogy
The idea that a noogy is rubbing someone on the head is incorrect that is a dutch rub. Anyone who has ever watched Classic Saturday night live knows that a noogy is given by making a fist and extending the knuckle of the middle finger so it sticks out a bit then rapping someone on top of the head with it. This from the classic bits where Bill Murray and Gilda Radner played nerdy schoolkids.
