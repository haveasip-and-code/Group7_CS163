Frank Lloyd Wright
Architect whose originality and style were overshadowed by his inflated view of self and tendency to create structures that leaked, were difficult to heat, and cracked. Embraced 'hypocritical humility' which is funny because he had nothing really to be arrogant about. The Unity Temple in Oak Park, like many of his works, looks like an upscale military barracks. He wasted alot of time avoiding the arch and pillar. Wright couldn't hold a candle to much better architects like Louis Sullivan or Daniel Burnham.
