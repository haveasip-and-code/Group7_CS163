shut in
A prisoner or recluse confined to a safe and comfortable area such as the home. The shut in lacks the capacity to regulate a stable social life as long as he or she is so confined, and in addition to a lack of healthy, natural sunlight, will usually become pale, depressed, insane, or generally pitiful in contrast to an outgoing individual. Synonymous with [tight ass], [worthless], [stiff], and [EverQuest] player.
