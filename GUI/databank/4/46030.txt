Chopin
Frederic Chopin, composer and performer of Romantic music (though he refused to be affiliated with the Romantic period), born 1810, died 1849. Composed exclusively for the piano, with a few pieces that had other instruments as accompaniment, or songs with piano accompaniment. His works are regarded by many as the epitome of Romantic piano compositions.
