National Skirt Day (NSD)
National Skirt Day, this is a day when all the girls where I live wear a skirt for the entire day. Some have panties under the skirt, some have thongs and g-strings under the skirt, and some girls wear nothing under the skirt. This day is the day in which one girl will not have think in their minds...'Will I be the only girl wearing a skirt today?' ; National Skirt Day is on the date of-- March 10th and it started the year of 1998, so, the very first National Skirt Day was, 3/10/1998. March 10, 1998 was the start of National Skirt Day, so be honored to know that the tenth day in March is a very special day. NATIONAL SKIRT DAY.
