Donnie Darko
A very fun and funny movie to watch. It appears to convey very meaningful themes but is not much deeper than any other movie out there. It's worth watching the first time for the humor and worth repeat viewings for unraveling the story. I personally recommend viewing it with the deleted scenes. ; As far as usage goes, this film is usually used as a stepping stone into other odd or cult films. People will either move on from this film to others or stick with it as the 'pinnacle of cinematic achievement' People that have moved on from this film (myself included ) tend to hate the latter fans partially because of their closed views on cinema but mostly because they hate it when something they love begins to become more mass market.
