medford lakes
A tiny, overdeveloped piece of land which has/had 22 lakes and a [P.J. Whelihan's]. Medford Lakes includes its own k-8 school system and underworked, overpaid police force which has nothing better to do than roam the streets aimlessly.

The high of a typical 'laker' kid is getting out of our school system into [Shawnee High School] or BCIT. While Medford Lakes may not be the best place in the world, at least we don't have rich snobs or rapists and murderers.
