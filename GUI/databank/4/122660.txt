snowbandit
In the case of a blizzard/whiteout, there are those, most often of younger age, that will immediately gear up and set out into the snow-coated streets with one objective in mind; dominate with snow. These are snowbandits, one with the white, clandestine in their operations, and always armed with a variety of different caliber snowballs to suit any given situation. Often moves in groups of two or more, though the occasional lone wolf may be encountered. Be cautious of their cleverness in tactics, the snowbandits are not to be underestimated.
