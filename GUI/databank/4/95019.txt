haxzor
A human being who generally has very inadequate computer gaming skills. This leads the person to use programs so that they can; Get more money, shoot through walls, Talk in an unreadable format. Using such programs only makes one a hacker. These people take it one step further to let everyone know in the game that they are hacking. Therefore letting the whole gaming community know of their extreme 'Haxzorness.' This usually ends in an account ban. During this time the Haxzor usually cries in their room until they can get some money to play another game. This is hard for the haxzor because indeed no other human being loves them not even their parent's therefore making the life span of such a being very short. Eventually, the haxzor becomes homeless or works at your local gaming store.
