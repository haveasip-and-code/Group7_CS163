PsP
A $250 piece of plastic that was never intended to play games. It has a faulty square button that sticks into the system and lots and lots of dead-pixels. You have to have at least 10% dead-pixels in order to return it and get your money back. It has a short battery-life and you have to pay $25 more just to watch a DVD on it that you already own. Adored by Sony Fan-gender-non-specific-people because it has overly bright graphics and can do fifty-million things that don't really matter that your computer already does for you better and without having to be charged regularly. 100 times less fun than a PS1, PS2, or DS.
