My people. Lot of drugs and arms trafficing in the bigger cities like Ciadud del Este and Ascuncion. People are friendly and commonly do as told. We're kinda starting to get our democratic elections going...Though I've gotta say we've been way more productive with dictatorship rule. At least now we can equip our troops much more well. Beautiful land.
