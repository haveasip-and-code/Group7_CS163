Jessy Sykes
American singer (from Seattle I think) and great artist whose lyrics equal her warm Gothic Country melodies. Jesse's voice and style make us want to rest, to close our eyes and to listen peacefuly to this good, still and atypical western sound. Just sit at the back of a bar, where lights are dim, listen to Jesse Sykes' songs and enjoy ! She's released two discs so far, Reckless Burning & Oh My Girl (I personaly prefer the frst record).
