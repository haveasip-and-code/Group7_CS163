Taxi Driver
brilliant film...the portrait of a lonely disenfranchised member of society who has been cast aside because of his failure to conform to the ideals that have swept over his community...Robert Deniro stars as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam Veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, the movie delves into his psyche which becomes more and more fatigued with each passing day, encountering the lowest rung of society. The movie climaxes in a crescendo of blood and violence in which Trais brings about a proverbial 'rain' in which to cleanse the city of the scum who have ruined it. This movie has been blamed for many violent acts that have been committed in America, in the same way that now-a-days people probably would blame Travis for blowing away a bunch of scumbags including a pimp and a john, but infact, just as Travis ultimately earned commendation, so should this film, it can not be believed that this movie was ever the inspiration for any incouragable acts, but rather the warning light that such things will go on if we as a society continue to allow the scum of the earth to reign supreme and shit on all that does not conform to it's slimy ways...
