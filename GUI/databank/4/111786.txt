Johnny Borrell
Lead singer of (brilliant) indie band [Razorlight]. Some would say arrogant, some would say confident. He's hated as much as he is loved. When on stage he turns into a bit of mad man but one with tons of personality, charisma and stage presence..is also liable to rip off his shirt at any given momment. He's a talented song writer too, just give the album a listen. ; Whatever the definition of Mr Borrell is, at the end of the day, he just makes damn good music (which makes me happy :])
