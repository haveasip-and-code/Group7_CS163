cable spaghetti
The series of cords needed to run your life from a desk or armchair, by connecting all your computer equipment, entertainment devices, and lamps. Cable spaghetti can be recognized by its nexus at a surge protector. Most appliances have at least one cord or cable; many have several. Wireless devices are represented in the spaghetti by their various rechargers, none of which are compatible, so you must have a different one for every device.
