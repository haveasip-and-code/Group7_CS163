BTP
Acronym for Boyfriendy Type Person. The BTP is not quite your boyfriend yet, but is more important to you than a casual fling. This term is used during that in between stage before you reach 'official' boyfriend and girlfriend status. The BTP is someone you don't feel right calling your boyfriend yet, but you have been seeing quite a bit of each other, talking on the phone etc. and have strong feelings for each other but have not yet made the final leap into coupledom. You don't neccessarily have to be sleeping together, and you can be seeing other people (and not consider it 'cheating'), though you may be feeling a bit guilty about this / get pissed off if you find out he is doing it, because the relationship is getting more serious. ; This term is used frequently by commitment-phobes. ; GTP is the female equivalent.
