A low security transportation meathod in the United States which neglects serving several states.(Yes they pretend that Alaska, Haiwii, South Dakota and Wyoming do no exist). Amtrak opperated trains ranging in age about fourty years. This system is a bit slow for trains but extremly pleasn't to travel upon.
