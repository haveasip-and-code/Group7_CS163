IN LONDON: ; A person, or gang of persons, who conviently live close to the american school in london and mug anyone they see from there. They are also known for the loud hanging out at starbucks when their school lets out and are know to clutter the Hampstead High Street at aprox. 4:30 - 6:30. ; If you see one of these ppl and are a male - run away - they will chase and mug u, but try to avoid this. if of the female variety and the gang are male be sure u are not wearing a skirt and anything revealing as this will lead to annoying abuse and comments. girls will also tend to annoy.
