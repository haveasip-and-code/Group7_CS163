yearbook
A book given out at the end of each schoolyear. Most guys only look at their picture and then forget about it, while girls go absolutely nuts over the thing and make every single person that they've ever talked to sign it. An example of something a girl would write would go as follows... ; 'OMG! TINA! Where to begin, LOL! We had soooo many fun times together this year! Let's stay [BFF], okay? Call me over the summer! Stay sweet! Love ya! OMG!'
