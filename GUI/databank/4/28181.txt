teams
a common term used in online video games when one team has a numerical advantage of atleast two extra playersover the other ; when 'teams' is called out, players should view the number of players for each team and make them even by switching or spectating ; however, if a team has only a one man advantage [eg, 8v7....it is not appropriate to call out teams]
