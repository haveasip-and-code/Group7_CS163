The original model for what would later become the Homestead and Grid City Acts. A scenic, dyspeptic Connecticut town engineered on the elliptic principle that the distance from any given house A to any store open after 9 B summed with the distance from A to something to do C will always equal D, where D is the distance to New York (of some mathematic curiousity, this will also always be the distance to [Wiggles]).
