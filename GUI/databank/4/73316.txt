the Big O
Montreal slang for the Olympic Stadium, where the Expos baseball team and Allouettes football teams have played at various times. Also home to a large and extremely well done natural history museum. Now vacant, except for large expositions such as the Home Show. Charactorized on the Montreal skyline by the slanted concrete tower with a finicular railway running up to the top. aka: The Big Toilet Built for the 1976 Summer Olympics, but the tower was not finished until some time in the late 80's Meant to be the first stadium with a fully retractable roof, it was not fully functional until the early 90's, but the parachute and cable design proved too unreliable.
