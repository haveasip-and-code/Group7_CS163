who are you
Originating on Cape Cod; a greeting between friends... (or enemies)... based on a line from one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies, taken off an internet soundboard used to prank call people w/the governator's voice. Rapidly gaining popularity wherever its original users are in college... from Florida to New England. On one legendary occasion, yours truly got Ahhnold himself to say 'who ahh you!?' when the terminator was sited at Gold's Gym on the Cape. ; (note: must be said with an Austrian accent)
