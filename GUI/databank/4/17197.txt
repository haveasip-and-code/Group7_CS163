grindcore metal
Death metal with a different name. people do not realize that it's the same thing because the usual audience of gridcore does not think 'Death metal' supports anything they believe in. In fact the only difference i can understand between death metal and grindcore is grindcore is sped up. i.e. speed up a pantera track and you got yourself grindcore.
