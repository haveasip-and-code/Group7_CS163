Constructicon
Member of a [Decepticon] Special Team made up entirely of construction vehicles. All coloured light green and purple, the Constructicons are Scavenger (hoe), Scrapper (digger), Bonecrusher (bulldozer), Mixmaster (cement mixer), Hook (crane) and Long Haul (dump truck). ; They combine into [Devastator]. The Constructicons were the first Special Team with a combined mode, and the only one inherited from the [Diaclone] line. Uniquely among the Generation 1 combiners, the Constructicons were not interchangeable and could only combine in a very specific way.
