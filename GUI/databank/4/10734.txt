Tax
Tax means steal / nick ; it originated from ; 'the tax man' ; after all he is the biggest thief of them all ; The word came about because the goverment make most of the population live in poverty and take all there money leaving most people barely enough to survive on, ; some decide to become criminals rather than live in poverty because they cant afford things due to tax causing high prices. All the goverment do for us is think of new taxes to bum from the people as a result people hate the goverment and taxes because they have to live in poverty and the goverment is seen as a thief so the word tax mostly replaced the words steal, nick, rob, thive, because everyone knows the tax man is a robbing bastid who only thinks of his own kind and what the fat cats can get, to them we are nothing more than worker ants
