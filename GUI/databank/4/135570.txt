Suburban Jew
Someone who has one parent who is jewish and one parent who is christian, and the kid follows both religions. Thus creating someone who is not truely jewish, but they often call themselves jewish. Some of them just use their christian backround to reap the benefits of christmas. Often found in the suburbs, hence the name.
