dark poetry
hmm, obviously you don't like poetry with meaning... lol, im not a dark person, or do i plan on being one, but i write poetry based on happenings and thoughts around me, some may have dark effects and impose feelings of sadness, wheras others will involve enjoyment and happiness, not all dark poetry is shit fuckhead...
