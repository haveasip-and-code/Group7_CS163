blink-182
blink-182 is a kick-ass band, consisting of the amazingly attractive Tom DeLonge, very hott Mark Hoppus, and Meet the Barkers star, Travis Barker. They write awesome music with amazing lyrics but many people can't appreciate them because of their lack to see past the word [punk] and have to disagree with their music because they 'aren't punk enough.' blink-182 makes awesome points that are often overseen because of who they are. They sing, have amazing drums and awesome guitar and bass playing and they rock. Everyone should love them.
