sockatooed
giving it to someone; not that way; but giving someone a piece of your mind. Telling them how it is. Getting pissed at someone. Yelling at someone. Starting a scene. Shoving it back in someones face. Making fun of someone; insulting them. Usually when you are sockatooing, it is a one way thing coming from you.
