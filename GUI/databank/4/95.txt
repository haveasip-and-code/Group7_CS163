halo'd
when people who seem intrested in you start to presue their feelings and then BOOM you're halo'd and all they do from this point on until they graduate is sit around and get 'clans' and play their stupid fucking xbox lives, and lie to themselves by saying they're having fun, when they know damn well they could be having tons more fun w/ you.
