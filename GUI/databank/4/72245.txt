O-Town
A small town in Maryland (Olney) known as 'O-Town'. Everyone in O-Town knows everyone else so much that it might scare you. THeres really no such thing as a 'secret' in O-Town, so watch what you say. The people there normally spend every single Friday night at there crappy theartre or the nearby icecream place, Coldstone. Its filled with wanna-be skateboarders and poppin-collared preps, except the preps arent wannabes. they ARE preps. Then there are a few of those misfit goth people and if there are brave enough to make it into Olney with those black craps on, everyone in o-town WILL stare at them, for hours. you can pretty much bet that everyone you will see in olney either attends sherwood, good counsel, holy cross, st peters, st andrews, farqhaur, rosa, or st judes. everyone complains that o-town is very boring, but yet, without fail, we still do the same thing every week, that we said was boring last week. a few tourists walk into O-town. What do they see? Mostly preps, a few gangsters, skateboard wannabes, and the occasional goth hangin at coldstone watching a massive fight between some guy, and most likely john mcglaughlin.
