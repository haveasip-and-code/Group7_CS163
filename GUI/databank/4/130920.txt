Top down weather
A corny and irritating phrase that is usually spoken as a poor substitution for an intelligent remark. Although usually used in casual conversation during the warmer months of the year, some choose to use it, inappropriately, during the winter. Such blatantly incorrect usage and unoriginality should be a shore sine that you are talking to a, stupid Saab driving, child raping, job stealing, impotent, arrogant fuck up.
