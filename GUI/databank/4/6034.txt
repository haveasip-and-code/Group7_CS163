bigfoot
often known as the 'missing link' bigfoot is a big, hairy, ape man thing that rooms the forests. its diet is very much like any primate. witnesses say that it ranges from 6-11 feet tall. obiviously there is a more than one of them if the thing really does exist, seeing as how there is a different variation of the beast ranging from state to state, country to country, continent to continent.
