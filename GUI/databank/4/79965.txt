the Mars Volta
A band that originated in Texas from post-punk At the Drive In, (also a great band), and decided to reform to develop numerous concept albums. The first, being De-Loused in the Comatorium (the story of a past band member Julio Venegas who commited suicide), is a masterpiece, blending Latin roots (some members are hispanic), trademark post-punk rock riffs, jazzy interludes, progressive and experimental synthesization and much more to create a deep, emotion-filled record. Their recent release, Frances the Mute, is just as legendary, yet focuses more on the song length and digital paraphernalia rather than conventional song-structure. And for the Mars Volta, this is definetely a good thing.
