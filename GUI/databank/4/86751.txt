D4
A person, male or female, you dosn't really have to live in D4(short for Dublin 4, an affulent rich area of Dublin) but does follow its culture. Many aspects of a D4, that are recognisibly D4 are their clothes (Abercrombie and Fitch, Designer labels), their acents and vocabulary (a Dublin form of Cockney Slang, e.g Wolfe (Tone phone) their accent is also very snobbish and they hate anything to do with the North Side, and Tallaght. Tallaght was named a honourary northside town by D4s last year. They also hate knackers(i.e travelers) with a vengeance. They have given many names to the North side and tallaght icludin Knackeraguia, Tallagtfornia, and Tallaghtban land. ; Many male D4s follow Rugby and can often been seen wearing rugby jersyes and Dubs. ; Female D4s wear Rugby jersey's from their boyfriends school, have long blonde hear, which they tie up, where dubs and sweat pants or o'niels. They also wear alot of fake tan and make up, which has earned them the nick name of oompa lumpas. ; They also like many t.v shows, which they will talk about endlessly the next day as if these people are real. These shows include: Dawson's Creek, Friends, Oc and Lost. As far as i know they have only read a few books, which are all incendently part of the Ross O'Carrol Kelly series which makes fun of D4s, bu don't tell them, it's funny. ; If you want to learn more about D4s read the Ross O'Carrol Kell y books, being The Miseducation years, P.s I scored the Bridesmaids and more.
