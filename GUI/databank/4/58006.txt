the sims
A curiously addicting simulation game by Maxis, in which one creates and controls an enviorment modeled after our own, giving one a 'God-like' power. ; This game allows you to build characters (called Sims), which includes customizing their clothing, personality (and thus, zodiac signs), careers, and homes. ; All Sims speak in their own interesting, nonsensical language, which is conveyed also by convenient 'bubbles' over their heads that express fascinating topics such as skiing, ufos, economics, or perhaps food. ; Unlike today's society, Sims are not restricted by gender, sexual orientation, appearance, nor skin color, although they may not be very bright. Sims face many obstacles throughout their days, such as going through doorways when another Sim is in their path-- often leaving them utterly baffled and confused. They also have a tendency to leap to their death when there is a kitchen fire, for they cannot resist the need to run toward it and express their terror and fear in the form of screaming, flailing, and thought bubbles.
