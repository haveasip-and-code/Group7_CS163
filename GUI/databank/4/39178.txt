Ghetto person (Boy)
Black people most da time usually whites try too hard...The wear baggy jeans and go to dematha, st johns, seaton ect. They mainly shop at UP AGAINST DA WALL and they look fly. They wear some lacoste but aint tryin to be [preppy], and they get there shoes at Foot Locker. They steriotyped for playin basketball and football which most do but they all dont. They listen to Hip Hop, Rap, and Go-Go and go to all the Gonzaga blackouts...except for dematha boys...they dont get in
