JAP
acronym for Jewish American Princess. ; Not every girl who wears Juicy, Louis Vitton, a side ponytail, baggy pants, goes to camp and private school is a jap, although many do. JAPS are internally insecure and show off their materialistic belongings because they are subconciously lacking. The truth is many JAPS have parents who are either over or under involved in their daughter's life. Instead of making fun of a JAP, you should pity her, for all she has is her Daddy's money.
