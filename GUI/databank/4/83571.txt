dunking on the board
This is a general term used by someone who has absolutely no concept of the game of basketball. If you ever hear someone say this, you should immediately be aware that this person has absolutely no business on a basketball court. If you see someone on a court stating this phrase, then rest assured you will soon be smoking their ass in a game of one on one.
