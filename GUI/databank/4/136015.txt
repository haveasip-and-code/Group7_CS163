Persian
Same thing as [Iranian]. ; A person that is from Iran. A person who has an Iranian background. ; The main Persian religion is Islam, and the other religion right behind it is Judaism. There are few Christian Persians. ; According to the U.S. government, all Persians as well as all of the Middle Easterners are classified as white (yes, even Indians), even though they really aren't. They should be classified as Middle Eastern. ; The Persian Muslims are desendents of Indo-Europeans, or the Aryans, and they were white. But look at them, Persian Muslims don't have pale skin anymore (they are tan, and brown, possibly near black!), they don't have blonde hair anymore (its dark brown and black), and their eyes are brown and black now (not hazel and blue). They ARE NOT Arab!! They speak Farsi. ; The Persian Jews, unlike Persian Muslims, are desendents of the Hebrews from Ancient Israel, and they are very close to the Arabs, but they are NOT Europeans. The Persian Jews are are NOT [Aryan]. They look the same as the Muslims from Iran, they are exactly the same, except of the religions and ancestory. But the same. Their skin colors are tan and brown as well. And NO, Persian Jews aren't cheap (ALL PERSIANS ARE CHEAP AT TIMES), and a lot of Persians need nose jobs themselves, not just the stereotypical 'big-nosed' Jew. They speak the same Farsi as Persian Muslims.
