Breed 77
Easily one of the greatest live bands to grace the surface of the planet. Their mix of the many variations of metal music, is astounding, like the hot and heavy 'Worlds On Fire' to the subtle 'Floods' and then to the simply beautiful song that is 'The River' This band are an all round class act. Don't just buy Cultora, track down the Karma C.D, otherwise known as their first album. This band kick arse. End of. Oh, I've seen them twice in 9 months :) ; When they sing 'We will rock you' as an encore - feckin awesome
