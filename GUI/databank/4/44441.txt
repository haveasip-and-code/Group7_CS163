muntos
A combination of [mucho] and [puntos] ; not to be confused with [mentos] ; Quote from The Diary Of Jeff Cobos ; 'We have tracked the elusive muntos down...they seem to be given out as rewards in a certain history class...SHAKA ZULU!...' ; *the diary ends here, with torn and bloodstained pages...we can only imagine what went down*
