the hill school
An institution located in Pottstown, PA, the slum of America. Hill School prides itself on its tradition, such as having seated meals and mandatory chapel services at 10 in the morning on Sundays. What is funny is that they, the administation, only keeps the tradition that it seems sutiable running. Expamle: The weekend of prom is now closed, meaning no one can leave after prom. they have to sit in theyre rooms and rot. How joyous. Is it not a tradition to go out, get laid, high, and wasted all in the same night after prom? Hill School also believes that it is proper for males to keep their dicks in a jar untill they graduate and only recently did they accept girls. We kids however are fighting the system by getting high, getting drunk, and having sex, as much and as often as we can. Possibly one day the Nazi's that run this joint will understand that we are kids, not machines programed for excellence. But until then, I'll jsut get blazed to pass the time away.
