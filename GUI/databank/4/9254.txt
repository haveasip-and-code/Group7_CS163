Scorched Earth Policy
1. the process of hooking up and promptly/perpetually ignoring the existence of the other party at every opportunity. If the Earth is properly scorched, then he/she should get the impression the he/she simply does not exist to in any capacity. There is no acknowledged contact (eye or otherwise) of any kind, with the exception of a second hookup, which should be achieved with less than five words (or 10 minutes) of ballgame expended. Should this second hookup occur, all questions and comments are to be ignored. Should still more hookups occur, repeat process for desired effect
