Weezer
Weezer are sort of a nerd rock band... but the thing is that they have created their own mixed genre with a bit of everything. Everything to do with the Weez should be based around Blue and Pinkerton, 2 of my favourite albums ever. ; They did OK with their latest three albums, Green, Maladroit, and Make Believe but have evidently deteirated over time. ; I like their early lyrics and melodies... and the best song is probably... eughh... no, I can't decide.
