SpOOkyG
The world's biggest Fox Mulder (The X-Files) fan, this rightfully labeled 'X-Phile' is female, single, and continually listening to Bree Sharp's 'David Duchovny' whilst daydreaming. ; If you, perchance, happen upon this odd, spooky character, she will most likely respond to phrases such as, but not limited to, 'The truth is out there' and 'Trust no one'. ; If any don't know much of this strange girl, they should very well be glad. If they knew anything more, it would be all too apparent that she's 'one Fox Mulder short of a good episode of The X-Files'. ; Should you see her, it is advised that you STAY FAR, FAR AWAY. She may attack at any moment, mauling those who come to close or just happen to be unlucky with her cat-like claws. ; SpOOkyG is a dangerously crazed Mulder fan and should not be made to feel threatened of losing or sharing her ownership of Mulder. Should such occur, she will attack with no holds barred. ; God help your sad little soul if you are unlucky enough to have this embodiment of black cat's bad luck cross your path!
