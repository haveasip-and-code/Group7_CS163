melech melech
Melech means salt in Hebrew. The problem is that melech also means king in Hebrew... so which one is which? We don't know, so we just say it's balagan. In other words, are you ever to say 'Melech melech' it could mean 4 things: ; 1.Salt Salt ; 2.Salt King ; 3.King Salt ; 4.King King ; Creating a lot of confusion among the Jewish population of talisin, a town in East Timor
