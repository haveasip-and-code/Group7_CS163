Circuit Queen
A gay man, usually between the ages of 30 and death, who frequents circuit parties in large cities (often named after a color, as in 'the white party'). Typically identical both physically and intellectually to the other 3,000 circuit queens in attendance. Difficult to determine exact age due to the counteracting effects of tina, botox, X, Viagra, Rogaine, steroids, the tanning bed, plastic surgery, and Xanax. Usually associates and/or mates exclusively with others of its sub-species.
