Northwest Territories
1. n. Northern territory above Alberta and Saskatchewan, west of Nunavut, east of Yukon Territory. Capital is Yellowknife, Total population is about 30,000. Best known for black flies in the summer, a frozen ice road in the winter, and diamond mines. Mostly Innuit (native northerners) in population. Don't call them eskimos, or they'll encase your balls in ice and feed them to the polar bears. English is a second language up there, as most speak various dialects of Inuktuk. DON'T ask them to throat sing.
