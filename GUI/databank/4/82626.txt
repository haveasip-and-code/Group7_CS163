SMU - Southern Methodist University
A picturesque, sprawling campus located in the heart of beautiful Dallas, Texas. While some novices to grammar and/or correct punctuation may sling in comments from the sidelines - i.e. the people who've never been to or live near SMU - in regards to SMU stereotypes, such as everyone is rich, drives a BMW, and comes from Highland Park, the reality of the school is far from this fabricated fiction. SMU offers over 70 majors to students, and its student-body consists of students from all 50 states and over 200 countries. As a full-scholarship student, I'll refer you to SMU's top ten business school in the world; its #2 dance department in the country; its CCPA department, which has won three consecutive national championships for debate and research, as well as the 2005 award-winning legal debate team; its advertising institute, which has won two consecutive national advertising campaigns, including one for the State of Florida; its journalism department, which consists of numerous former Pulitzer-prize winning journalists, such as Craig Flournoy, who also is a contributing writer for the Columbia School of Journalism Review; and its graduate schools - a top tier law school, a top-five MBA program, housed by a new $18.3 million, state-of-the-art building, and many other graduate programs.
