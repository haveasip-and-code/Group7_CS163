Muhammed
Actually,I am not a muslim but I read biographies of him. According to my readings, he is a perfect man and peak of the humanity. If it is true, el-qaide is false or If it is false, el-qaide is true. I am confused. Most probably the biographies and sayings about him are strongly true, because I examined him from western views and authors.
