D-Rock
A curly-haired over enthusiastic teacher at Wilton High School. He is the assistant coach for the Wilton High School Varsity Soccer team and tries to prove himself as a real soccer player even though he will always live in the shadow of his more successful cousin Kristine Lilly. He finds comfort in hitting on freshman girls in his Western Civilization classes.
