lah
a slang used mainly by people of South-East Asia (Malaysia and Singapore mainly) to complement almost any sentence available in a social conversation. the origins of this slang is basically from the chinese language, yet it is now used by almost anyone in the two countries mentioned above who aren't too shy to let their asian roots shine with pride. people who don't use the -lah slang is considered a snob to a certain degree.
