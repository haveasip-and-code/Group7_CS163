Pawtucket
City just north of Providence in Rhode Island, not too big, but ranked the 2nd most unsafe city/town in Rhode Island after [providence] in 2004-2005. ; Like the city's 2 high schools, most of the population is ghetto or white trash. Known as 'the bucket. There are, however, at least a couple nicer neighborhoods such as country side, darlington, and quality hill. City has produced several above average baseball and basketball players in the recent years. Home of Pawtucket Red Sox and Hasbro Toy Company (GI Joe and Mr. Potatoe Head were invented) and Slater Mill, founded in 1671. See [east greenwich] or Barrington if you think you're too good.
