sirius black
The most overrated character in the Harry Potter series. He died in book five, and is never coming back. This fact has even been confirmed by author, J.K. Rowling. Despite this, geeky girls who spend their time reading and writing fan fiction instead of going outside and having a real life continue to believe that he is alive. Get over it, you losers, he's gone.
