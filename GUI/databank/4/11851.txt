infinity plus one
Perhaps the biggest number I could think of when I was, like, six years old. ; (True: if you ask a mathematician, it's not really a 'number.' But when I was, like, six years old, I didn't give a [flying fuck].) ; (Also true: As soon as I said 'infinity plus one,' my buddy would cleverly outdo me with [infinity plus two].)
