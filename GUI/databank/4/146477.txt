Emerdale
A poorly written ITV soap opera, which represents the good, honest people of Yorkshire as idiots, and helps fuel the untrue belief that Yorkshire men are obbsessed with beastiality. In truth perverse interest in animals is only found in one area of Yorkshire... Whitby, which is only very small and generally unimportant anyway.
