Arnie
A term used to describe someone of impossible strength, someone with the ability to pound Hummer's into coke cans and soak up bullets like an AK spits them out. Of course, only Arnie can posses such strength and thus it is only possible to allocate this term to people within the general viscinity of his strength, say, 100th of it. ; However, huge arms and henchman thwacking potential is not all that constitutes a person deserving enough of the Arnie moniker. No, that person must also be able to recycle a select number of crude phrases after each finishing blow.
