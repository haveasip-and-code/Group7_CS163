St.Lukes school
an awsome school for kids in grades 5-12 only bout 400 people a quarter of them are on drugs or get kicked out for drinking. have teachers that can not stop eating (raff). They are awsome in sports and beat almost every school(always harvey) and is always under construction in some way but now they have a kick ass PAC (performing arts center) and a really awsome Athletic center. And all the teachers hate the class of 2007 cause they are always really bad but that class of 2011 will be just like them
