Nazi Brunette
When a [blonde] or a group of [blondes] develop a crush on a black guy in the southern regions of the United States, a Nazi Brunette infiltrates the blonde clique in hopes of thwarting a possible interracial romance when not based on monetary exchange such as a [drug deal]. Blondes have been taught to grudgingly yield to brunette advice, as they are percieved as the 'smarter ones', but the Brunette Nazi usually has a mean spirited agenda of [manipulation] and/or [hatred] for all parties involved. See also: [buzzkill].
