Red October
Named after the famous Russian submarine, Red Octobers are those once-in-a-lifetime turds that block the toilet. You can't flush them, you can't deal with them in the normal way. Toilet paper is a serious no-no with regards to Red Octobers as this merely increases the 'gross' factor by twelve. If you see a Red October, the chances are that you'll need to call the emergency services.
