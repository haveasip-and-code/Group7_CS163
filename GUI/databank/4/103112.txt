Millie (millbag  milliard)

The term has been around long before chav existed. ; It goes back to the days when the rough and working class fishwives worked in the Linen Mills, hence millie. ; The male equivalent is 'spide'. Its roots and origins are unknown, but spides normally hang around corners with massive carryouts and hurl abuse at passersby.
