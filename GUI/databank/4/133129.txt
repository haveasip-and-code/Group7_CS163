Superdome
An indoor stadium in New Orleans, LA. It is the home team of the New Orleans Saints. Unfortunately, they built it on top of an old cemetery. This cursed the Saints to a record of losses for 36 years. Then in late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina approached New Orleans, the Superdome was used as a last resort shelter for those who couldn't evacuate New Orleans in time. About 5,000 people stayed. When the hurricane had it's way with New Orleans, the Superdome suffered substantial roof damage when the roof's white membrane was torn off by storm surge. The stadium quickly became a hellhole, with reports of murder and even child rape. The Superdome is now a biohazard and is closed down indefinitely.
