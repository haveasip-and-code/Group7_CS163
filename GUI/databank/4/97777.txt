Ju-C
An orange flavored soft drink bottled and sold in Barbados. ; Public bus transport in Barbados called that because they have (or used to have) a Ju-C advertisement placard on the front of the bus. The Ju-C sign really grabs your attention because the buses are huge and they come right at you on very narrow roads.
