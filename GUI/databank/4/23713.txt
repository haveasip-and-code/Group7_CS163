The 'I wish I was Japense fanclub'. It features several main characters: ; Piro - The webmaster, artist, and main character of the comic. He is portrayed as a innocent pansy nerd, with a kink for Japanese girls and a obsessive sock fetish. Thankfully, his wussiness has restrained him from several potential scenes of rape throughout the comic, thus keeping the material clean for all readers. ; Largo - Stereotypical gamer and avid comptuer overclocker, babbles in nonsensical 'l33tsp33k', and due to his constant binging, has incredible resistance to physical punishment, which aids him well in his quest to purge all of Japan of 'zombies', possibly a fabrication of his manic America Versus Japan culture clashing. ; 'The Queen' - Archnemesis of Largo, she posesses formidable skills in gaming, rivaling the disillusioned yankee himself. Intrigued by Largo's stubborness to cling onto his assinine beliefs, much of her story involves a complex silent-romance between her and the unwary Largo. ; Hayasaka-San - One of the first friends Piro makes in Japan, she works in a game shop downtown. She keeps to herself about her personal life, and fends off sexual predators with voracious ferocity. ; Generic Schoolwhore - A teenager of 16, she too has a crush with Piro, and with the pressure of her two bimbo peers, is forced into a shakey relationship with the reclusive twigboy.
