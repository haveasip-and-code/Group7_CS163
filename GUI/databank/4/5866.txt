Audi
A slower cheaper version of a Mercedes or BMW. Audi's slogan 'Never Follow' is contradictory considering the M3 and C55 are both faster than the S4- the E55 and M5 are faster than the RS6 by over 100hp, and the S8 couldn't beat a S55 if it's life depended on it. Bottom line- people buy Audi's because of the shitty resale and nice interiors.
