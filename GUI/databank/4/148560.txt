Rain dog
A Rain Dog is a dog caught in the rain, with its whole trail washed away by the water so he can't get back home. A stranded dog, who wants nothing better than to get home. ; People who live outdoors, people who sleep in doorways, loners knit together by some corporeal way of sharing pain and discomfort. ; A term coined by Tom Waits on his album named Rain Dogs
