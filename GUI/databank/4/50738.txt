Soundgarden
A transcendant rock band that rode in on the fame of grunge but was not a real part of the genre, as they had actual talent. Soundgarden could turn guitar and drum into an four man orchestra that created some of the most haunting and intense music written this century. Undeniably skilled and creative, they have been dearly missed since they disbanded in 1997. The kind of band that comes along once or twice in a generation - made even better by the fact that most people don't appreciate them. The fans are real.
