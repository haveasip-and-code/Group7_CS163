Saint Paul
AKA [St Paul] ; Saint Paul is a city of about 275,000 in [Minnesota]. Saint Paul is one of the [Twin Cities], the other city being [Minneapolis]. Saint Paul is the capital of Minnesota. This is one fucked up town. To start out with, the streets in Saint Paul make about as much sense as wiping before you poop. There are streets that do the damnest things ever. Another sad fact about Saint Paul is the dumpy West Seventh Neighborhood and the eastside of Saint Paul. These areas are shittier then the ghettos of Chicago. With lawns lavishly decorated with many appliances and cars, one cannot feel but urged to get the hell out of there. With these areas of scum and filth, you'd think Saint Paul is a total shithole. There are a few good areas in Saint Paul. The Summit Avenue neighborhood, surrounding the beautiful Saint Paul Cathedral, contains homes so large and eligant, it's astonishing. Not too far away is the beautiful Capital Building. Our Capital is known to be the best building in all 50 states. Then across the I-35E, I-94 is the semi-ugly downtown area, where condos sell for $500,000 minimum (dumbasses). Then the smelly Mississippi River and damn does it smell. Well that's Saint Paul, Minnesota. Fuck it all, I'm moving to Cottage Grove.
