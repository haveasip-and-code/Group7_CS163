Kabala
a religion made popular by celeberties; red string bracelet is worn to 'ward off evil sprits'; just a fad like the celebs themselves. (ashton kutcher, paris hilton, lindsay lohan) someone should ask paris hilton what the hell she knows about kabala. i'm sure she's very religious. i heard she reads.
