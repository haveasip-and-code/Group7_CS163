Yugioh
an extremely underrated card game that can be fun, but gets old fast. the show, on the other hand, sucks ass. but that's the american version. for all those people who say 'it's the crappiest show ever', watch the japanese anime, the original version, on subtitles. it fallows a completely different storylinbe, and they play different games besides the card game.
