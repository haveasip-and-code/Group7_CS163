Worthington
Boring suburban hellhole north of [Columbus],[Ohio] bordering I270. Cookie cutter town full of white picket fences, look-a-like houses, and ridiculous zoning laws. Can be confused with a 1950's televison show at times. What it lacks in diversity it makes up in snobby people who claim to be liberals. Not as rich as [Dublin] but wealthier than [Westerville]. Teenagers call it Wo-Town.
