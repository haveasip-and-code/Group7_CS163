bowling for soup
4 fat guys from Texas. If they weren't musically gifted, they would be complete losers. I think they're good, but you dumbasses are arguing if they're good or not. I side with neither and will mock you both. First, they are a good band and this obsession with 1985, it isnt a nonsense song. It's about a woman remembering how she loved the 80's but the fans don't give a damn and don't understand the song. Second, they aren't a punk band. They might have the right to be since they were all losers in school(I'm pretty sure they were) unlike this jackasses like [My Chemical Romance]. They don't complain that their life sucks in their songs. And for people who think they're punk, these songs pertain to absolutely NOBODY! Everyone thinks there life sucks, but they aren't as bad as they think. You just ruin your own life. Anyway, I could have stopped at '4 fat guys from Texas'
