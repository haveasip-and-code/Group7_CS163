hijab
A mobile tent/prison that [Islam] uses to imprision it's female followers. The original purpose of such clothing is rooted in the need to protect ones face agains sand storms. It has however been indoctrinated into the [Quaran] and women in Isalmic countries are often severely punished or murdered for failing to wear the hijab in public. ; A hijab allows the wearers eyes to be visible and is not to be confused with the [burqa], where the entire face and body is covered (often making walking or moving a very hazardous task). ; While it could be argued that the hijab does serve two practicle purposes in arid desert countries, to protect against the elements, and also to reduce the woman to an object with no visible individual characteristics and hence remove any sex appeal to members of the opposite sex. This second purpose obviously primarily benifits the husband/father/owner of the hijab wearing woman. ; [Muslims] often wear the hijab when living in other non-derert and non-muslim countries. Unfortuately this can have a very negative effect as far as intergration is concerened because in nearly all non-Muslim cultures and countries, the concealment of the face is regarded as offensive, intimidating and disrespectful. ; This stems from the fact that historically, in non-Muslim countries at least, concealment of the face has been left in the domain of criminals, [terrorists] and other deviants who wish to conceal their identities from mainstream society for fear of retribution.
