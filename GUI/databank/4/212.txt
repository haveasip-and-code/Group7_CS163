More Cowbell
More cowbell is the reason that Blue Oyster Cult's mega-hit 'Don't Fear the Reaper' reached such heights. While recording the song, the cowbell track was barely audible. It was the sharp ear of the producer who stepped in and demanded 'more cowbell.'(After all, he did know how to make hit records.)
