sour grapes
this phrase is derived from the fable by an acient guy called aesop ; the story is that a fox sees some grapes high up0n a tree, he tries to get them,but after many failed attempts,the fox walks aways and says 'they are probably sour anyway' ; when somebody says 'thats sour grapes' they are talkign about somebody desiring something,but unable to have it,so they pretend like they dont want it.when infact they do!
