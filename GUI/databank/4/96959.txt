catcher in the rye
One of the great American novels. Fascinating, stream of consiousness style by the famouse recluse author J.D. Salinger. Any adolescent who reads this book should beable to relate to the narrator, Holden Caulfield. He struggles with alienation, nihilism, and disillusionment with the modern, post-industrial captitalist state.
