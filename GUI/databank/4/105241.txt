havaianas
Only the most comfy flipflops ever made, Brazilian born these flipflops are the Mercs of rubber foot wear and have achieved true cult status! In the Havaianas factory in Campina Grande, Paraiba, 5 pairs of sandals per second are produced, which add up to 105 million pairs per year. Since their launch 2.2 billion pairs of Havaiana sandals have been produced and sold (if all the size 37 sandals were laid end to end they would go around the world 50 times).
