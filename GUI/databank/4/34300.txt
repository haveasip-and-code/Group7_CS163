urban dictionary
urban dictionary is an internet slang dictionary. for the most part it consists of entires featuring the latest colloquialisms of our generation and also a lot of well-wishers attempting to kick start their own slang words (and we all hope it works out for the best) ; Urban Dictionary is not an encyclcopedia - so perhaps people should stop using it as such. ; neither is it a message forum, or a livejournal - ; it is a fairly entertaining, enlightening (completely useless) read in need of some serious fascistic reformation
