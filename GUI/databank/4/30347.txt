NME Child
The [NME] is a (rubbish) weekly music magazine/newspaper. ; The [NME] Children are those who read it religiously, and once the [NME] says/does something, they do it too, to be cool. ; One Prime Example: The [NME] says they like Pete Doherty, all the twelve year olds run around screaming they love him. Once the [NME] decides he broke up The Libertines, thus the [NME] don't like him anymore, the [NME] children rip up all their posters, cross out the hearts with his name written in them, and run aroud saying they hate him.
