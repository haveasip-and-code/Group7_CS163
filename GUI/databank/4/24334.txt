it
Used to reference a person who may appear to be gender inspecific. Generally used in the third person. This isn't suggesting that 'it' is a third gender but merely agreeing to reference the person in a gender neutral way. Often applied to girls with short hair (dykes?) and boys with long hair (jesus?).
