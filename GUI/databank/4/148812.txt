living colour
Perhaps the first all-African-American rock/heavy metal band in history-- or rather, the first mainstream all-African-American rock/heavy metal band in history, Living Colour was, and still is, a revolutionary band, which combined raging guitar riffs with amazing drum beats and crazy, nimble basslines,and occasionally a synth or two (like in Hemp or Auslander). Although they put out wuite a few records, the two they're best known for are Tim's Up, which mainly consisted of vicious, off-beat guitar riffs, jazzy synthisizers, and hypnotic basslines, and Stain, which, except for the songs'Hemp' and 'WTFF,' is purely metal. ; The mambers of the band are Vernon Reid (the guitarist, and one of the last real artists alive), Corey Glover (vocalist, Danny Glover's son, star of the movie 'Platoon,' and the founding member of Living Colour), William Calhoun (drummer, and music major (woot to the nootches!)), and Doug Wimbish (bassist, originally backed Grandmaster Flash and the Furious on Sugar Hill records). Each member is key in the execution of the music, and each instrument melds together with the others to create a smooth, but eerily off-beat sound which marked the black man's first real foray into white history. What's more, they managed to use the white man's music to fight racism, sexism, homophobia, AIDS, poverty in Africa, and conformity. ; The members of the band split up in 1995, each going their separate ways, then reformed sometime in the past 5 or 6 years. They are still touring, and are coming to the Chicago House of Blues on December 5th, 2005. Tickets for general admission cost $20. Which means that the House of Blues is already $20 richer.
