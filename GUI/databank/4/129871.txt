White Stripes
A band whose high sales and popularity are proof that the general public has no taste in music. White Stripes is comprised of people with *at most* 2 months of music instruction, zero vocal instruction, and a pseudo-70's low-fidelity sound. Music doesn't have to be complex to be fun to listen to (ie. Nirvana), but if it's both lacking structure AND annoying to listen to, you have a crappy band on your hands.
