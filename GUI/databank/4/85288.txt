Nascar
Racing sport. To some, it's trash. To others, it's a way of life. Apparently, anyone with a passion for motorsports will know it's shit. Rednecks watch it and hoplessly support the sport. It has ruined Speedvision and turned it into Redneck TV, along with the occasional race where the racers turn RIGHT. TRASHCAR is soon to become the root of all evil.
