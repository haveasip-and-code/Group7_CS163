Git it done
What nearly everyone in the nation says instead of that retarded, southern redneck term [Git R Dun] (or [Git Er Done]). ; First widely introduced by [Larry The Cable Guy], Git R Dun was apparently an attempt to further destroy the English language, and in an effort to make some Americans a little bit dumber and more irritating. Fortunately, however, most Americans aren't attracted to this horrid slang term, and the majority of us still say 'git it done' (or get it done, in proper written form.)
