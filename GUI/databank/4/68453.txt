pash and dash
Pash,the above mentioned definition for a passionate kiss, a snog or a french kiss. Coupled with dash, (as in the word run) it is a term used for a moment where one left the scene soon after the pash and did not take things further 'in a physical sense' beyond the pash. A highly useful term to define an evening 'on the pull' in two words.
