Post Modern
Origionally an architectural style based on the philosophical position that progression in the arts need not necessarily be a linear process. Post Modernism is the acknowledgment that nothing is, or will remain truly modern. One statement made in the name of Postmodernism is that History has ended in a cul-de-sac. Proponents of Post Modernism try to provide an interesting mixture of disparate styles and artistic references borrowed from the past. It is difficult for theorists to end the era of postmodernism since postmodernism seeks to be the destroyer of theoretical positions and therefore its own demise is merely a Post Modern concept. Now covers all areas of the art world. For more info, see some art books
