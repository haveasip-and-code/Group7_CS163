Apocophilia
An attraction to, or taking pleasure in, end-of-society scenarios, such as global nuclear war, or worst-case peak-oil or global-warming. ; Often leads to what others would regard as a 'pessimistic' world view, however Apocophiliacs often identify with an 'up-side' to the total destruction of mostly everything. Proof of irrationality can often be found in a belief that they will survive the impending apocolyse themselves.
