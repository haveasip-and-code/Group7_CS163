bluffington
A drink (most often 32 oz.) popularized at the gas station/convenience store franchise, Quik Trip. The drink is 2/3 orange cream slushie and 1/3 Dr. Peppper. The actual ratio varies. A [hoss] Bluffington is the drink of the 44 oz. size or the 52 oz. size. The Bluffington was first made on a fateful night by the Sheriff; the name was developed by a russian madman, the Czar. It is enjoyed by all.
