hinduism
Hinduism is the most ancient religion in the world. At present it is the third largest religion in the world with nearly 900 million followers where 850 million live in India. It originated 3000 years ago at the banks of river Indus( now sadly in Pakistan ) with the creation of sacred Vedic texts , the major language is Sanskrit( mother of all present day european languages ). It is a way of living more than a religion. The many forms of Hinduism are henotheistic religions. They recognize a single deity, and view other Gods and Goddesses as manifestations or aspects of that supreme God. Henotheistic and polytheistic religions have traditionally been among the world's most religiously tolerant faiths. Hindus are divided into four groups, namely the brahmins(priests), kshatriyas(warriors), vaishyas(traders) and harijans(workers). India was(and still is) the land of hindus, there is no other country which we can call our own. ; India was ruled by Muslims for 1000 years and then christians(British) for 200 years, even then Hinduism existed, thanks to the warrior clans of sikhs,marathas and rajputs. We have never tried to convert other people by force, bribe or lure, although fresh converts are welcome. The sacred texts of Hinduism are Bhagwad Gita( the word of Lord Krishna ),Ramayana( the legend of Prince Ram ), Mahabharata( the second longest epic in the world,it describes the biggest ever war in India,fought at Kurukshetra,and the lessons to learn from it) and the Vedas ( the principles of Hindu living). Major festivals are Diwali(the festival of lights, it celebrates the homecoming of Prince Ram), Dussehra( celebrated as the victory of good over evil), Holi(festival of colours), Ram Navami(birth of Prince Ram), Shiv Ratri(birth of Lord Shiva) etc.
