god squad
a group of people consisting of st. mary's church youth who hang out at least 3 times a week, including wednesdays mostly. although they are in tune with God, most people can not recognize that this group of unrespectful, drama-filled, confident teenagers even know what the word God means. They call themselves the God Squad, and everyone else better watch out.
