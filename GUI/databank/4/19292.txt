Padres
San Diego's baseball team. The Padres were notoriously bad intheir first decade of existnce, the 1970s, before winning their first NL pennant in 1984. After having an up-and-down 90s, the Padres appeared to be headed for a decade of failure by finishing last in the NL West from 2000-2003. However, the team turned things around in 2004, dumping the orange/blue color combination for a new, deep blue/tan combo. This switch was made to signify the organization's turnaround with their new ballpark, PETCO Park. The Padres did indeed play well in 2004, staying in playoff contention until September's final weeks.
