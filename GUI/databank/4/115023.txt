Kenny McCormick
Character On South Park, a comedy central tv show. He wheres an orange parka that covers his entire face and muffles all his words, he never takes this parka off ever except for one quick second in the South Park Movie. Kenny is also very poor, his family has many welfair babies. Kenny is one of the four south park boys. In almost every episode up until the end of season five, Kenny dies, but then re-appears the next episode. In the 6th season of the tv show, he is dead for good, and its replaced by [Butters]. In the 7th season Kenny re-appears. Kenny is also the most perverted out of the four boys, he knows everything about sex and explains it to the boys, but ofcourse it is muffled. However the boys can understand kenny through his muffling coat, and they talk and interact with him. It is just harder for viewers like you and me to undertand him...
