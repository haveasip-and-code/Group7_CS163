institute of notre dame
IND is an all-girls school in baltimore, maryland. It is known to be 'ghetto' just because of where it's located. Inside, it is totally the opposite.(you wouldnt know until you've been inside) IND has the most awesome spirit weeks! ;) we've got stuff to be proud of like the Varsity&JV basketball team (who don't go around getting pregnant unlike other schools out there...)Other sports that IND rock at are soccer, lacrosse, cheerleading, track, and MANY more. ; There are many rumors about the school, but the people that actually make up those rumors are just jealous because they know IND is way better and they've got nothing better to do. ; And yes, IND is A REAL PRIVATE SCHOOL. Obviously, whoever said that does not know IND at all. Education is the most important part of IND. And 99% of the girls get into great colleges all around the U.S. and they use their education from IND to their benefit. ; All around, IND is a great high school that people should get to know before believing the rumors. (or making up any)
