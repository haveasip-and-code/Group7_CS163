Wikipedia
An elaborate message board filled with complete inaccuracies, tabloid influenced rhetoric, outrageous emotional based opinions, blatant political conflagration, and callous disregard for scientific fact, which is thinly disguised as a free, open source, online encyclopedia that postures itself to be an authoritative and factual information resource; where the moderators and owners of the site delete and cover up entries they disagree with, discounting objective facts and labeling such users as 'vandals' inside the alleged collaborative structure that is really designed to have the web population do its work for them with no compensation.
