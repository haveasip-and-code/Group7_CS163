Allentown
crap city in crap state. 3/4 of city consists of said 'niggers' and is almost totally made up of 'ghetto.' sights worth seeing in allentown include: obese puerto ricans walking like 'gangsters' with pants at their knees (kneepants) for males, or extremely low cut shirts made up of a square foot of material exposing saggy breasts for nice white girls like myself to see and possibly choke from seeing. these shirts tend to be red. also my favorite sight is all of the 'gangsters' with their hair plastered onto their foreheads like they are heading into high winds and need to keep it in place. for examples of this, see the yearbook of trexler middle school, where you'll find examples of all of these. allentown in two words: scary shit.
