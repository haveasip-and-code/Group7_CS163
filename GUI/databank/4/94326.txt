BoA
A pretty Korean singer whom although she does not bear any credit to writing her own lyrics, has achieved things in her nineteen years that most people will never achieve. ; The girl fluently speaks THREE other languages beside her native tongue of Korean; Japanese, Mandarin and English. ; BoA is so popular in Asia, that she has two seperate official websites. One based in Korea and one based in Japan. ; She also has a bunch of unofficial English websites created by her fans in America and Europe. ; Once of BoA's recent Japanese single releases, 'DO THE MOTION' was so popular that it surpassed 200,000 copies, taking the top spot on the weekly Oricon Chart, and made BoA the first non-Japanese Asian to reach number one in over a decade. Her album sales have also broken official figures for biggest seller. BoA's first album released in Japan has recorded an order quantity of 1.2 million copies as did her recent greatest hits 'Best Of Soul'. ; She is a star renoun throughout the whole of Asia and totally owns the stage next to most other Asian pop singers. ; She has also opened the door to other Korean singers to come across to the Japanese market, eg;[SE7EN], DBSK. Her popularity in Japan has also been seen as a positive aid in rebuilding past broken ties between the two nations. ; Her dancing is unmatched and she can actually hold a note without the aid of voice sythesisers. Amazingly she performs live whilst conducting complicated dance routines; even for crummy tv appearances. ; BoA has also done tons of modellling including a shoot for MAYBELLINE in New York. ; Despite the fact that BoA is only fully exposed to the East Asian market, she is still often compared to Britney Spears for her overnight dominance and similar 'pop princess' countenance. This is questionable however as BoA is not half as slutty. That is just the tip of why BoA is not Britney Spears but I'm sure you can form your own opinion on that seperate matter.
