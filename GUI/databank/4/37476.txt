summoner
much like the highly-addictive [morrowind]this game slowly seeps all traces of real life out of you. it replaces all of your real friends and family with more powerful, fictional ones. eventually after playing this game enough you will become a junkie who spends all his time playing the damn game and never shuts up about it, and after a while you will get to the point where you suck at every fukin game except summoner.
