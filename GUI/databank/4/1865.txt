The most dominant center ever to play the game of basketball. A rapper, actor, intellectual, entertainer, or all around jack of all trades aka the fucking man. So big deal hes not good free throws, you wouldnt be either if you had hands that were two ft. But I guess thats the price you pay for having a huge penis.
