Teen Girl Squad
A cartoon created by Strong Bad of homestarrunner.com. 4 girls between the ages of 13 and 19, who do various teenage activities, such as going to the mall, and being killed by a man with a large mouth. The leader of the group is Cheerleader, a rich girl who looks SO GOOD and has a boyfriend. She hangs out with So and So, What's her Face and The Ugly One. So and So is the smart one who is in love with Brett Bretterson, her friend she made up in first grade. What's her face is a depressed girl who gets all the bad luck, is only able to shop at thrift stores, and had to play bass in their band. The Ugly One is well, the ugly one. Her past accomplishments include having the teacher call her 'young man' and wearing a three-piece swimsuit. There is also the man with a large mouth who appears in many of the episodes, often to somehow harm one of the four with a word that ends with ''d'. Teen Girl Squad. It's SO GOOD!
