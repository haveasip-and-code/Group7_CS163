baseball cards
Basically these are collector items in the vein of [Pokemon Cards] and [Magic Cards], but predates all card based collectables. Like magic and pokemon cards, baseball cards contain statistics, but unlike magic and pokemon cards, the players with which these statistics refer to are real and not imaginary like players dipicted in [magic] and [pokemon], which are made up to serve gaming purposes. Thus, baseball cards are not gaming cards and serve only to amuse and pleasure those who love [baseball] and their players (See [keedon], [baseball]).
