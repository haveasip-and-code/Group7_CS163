Catalina
Crazy-ass Latina bitch from the games [Grand Theft Auto III] and [Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]. Catalina was the main villain in GTA III and in San Andreas, she was [CJ]'s girlfriend for a little while until she became very dissatisfied with him. Afterwards, she went to Liberty City to live with the GTA III protagonist and to work for the Colombian Cartel. A complete tomboy with a short temper, Catalina seems to hate nearly all men and even sees the men she 'likes' only as mere crime partners and occasional fuck-buddies.
