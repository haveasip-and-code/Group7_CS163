Ben Mulroney
The host of eTalk Daily and [Canadian Idol]. Appears to have a lifetime membership to Fabutan and a Frequent Shoppers card for Holt Renfrew. His lines are scripted, and his chin is gigantic, but at least he is a better host than [Ryan Seacrest] of American Idol, because he doesn't use stupid sayings like 'Seacrest, out!'
