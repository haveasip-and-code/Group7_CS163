waste-oid
a Detroit original: a person currently living in, or who has lived in a wasteland. Can be described as an over-eager-suburbanite who desperately wants to be part of the city, and usually claims to be from part of the city, despite obvious social and cultural differences that make it apparent that they are NOT from the city. Marshall Mathers.
