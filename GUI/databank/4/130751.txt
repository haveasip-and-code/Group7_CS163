Indihominis
A stereotype that undefines stereotypes; not quite emo, not quite a prep, but the individuals in between who seek to have a label. A mixture of all different personalities and types of styles. ; Sick and tired of being labeled as something you're not? ; Feel like you're in between two styles? ; GUESS WHAT? ; YOU'RE INDIHOMINIS.
