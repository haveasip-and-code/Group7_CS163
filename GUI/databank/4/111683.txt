Crocker
Typically, a grandmother figure from the southern United States, with a 'southern twang' accent. Crockers usually smoke cigarettes, but aren't proud of it, and also love their grandchildren but are extremely disciplinary and attempt to make lectures on waiting for sex until marriage, and to love God. Crockers favorite resturants can be something to the extent of an all-you-can-eat cafeteria, or for fancy nights, the Cracker Barrel. Their favorite gas station is Hess. Most crockers watch [soap operas], [Walker Texas Ranger], or [Touched By an Angel].
