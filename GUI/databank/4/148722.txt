Confederate States of America
A group of states that didn't like the way United States of America was going, so they said they weren't really part of the United States of America anymore. The rest of the country didn't like this, so they started a war. A lot of people think the war was fought over slavery, but that was just one issue among many. Most southerners didn't even own slaves, although most of the ones who did owned a lot of them. The next most common thing is to own one slave or no slaves.
