milamber
A coder who, while very good at coding, behaves in a very script kiddish manner; takes out sites and servers because they dare disagree with his idea of how things should be run. He also thinks elite coders' abilities should be put on CD and sold to script kiddies for profit. Milamber can be compared, in this manner, to imperialist and facist governments, like the US government, facist italy, nazi germany, and the former USSR, and also big business, like Microsoft (TM). See also 'tripple.'
