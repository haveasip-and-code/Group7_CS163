anal-virginity boogeyman
A far more fearsome version of the original boogeyman, one so fierce even the original boogeyman himself fears this one. The anal-virginity boogeyman comes in the night to rob anal virginity from those who possess it. But be warned, anal sex fans, for if the boogeyman finds you have no anal virginity, he's still going to get you up the butt anyway.
