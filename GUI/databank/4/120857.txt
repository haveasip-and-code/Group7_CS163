Jamestown has the same reputation throughout Rhode Island.. rich burn outs. Not only do the youth, but most parents smoke pot as well. It is a sweet spot for growing, and also known to be a chill spot for high rides. Considdering the amount of teens that smoke at NKHS.. about 60% of them come from Jamestown. But weed isn't the only drug around on this gorgeous island, its also been known for a place to trip out. If Jamestowners are dry, everyone is dry. If nothin is around, you most likely wont see the Jamestown crew out and about either. Nothing happens until herb or lq is found. Their nights consist of getting high or drunk, usually somewhere outside but occationally at some poor kids house that made the announcement that his/her parents are away.Many just sit around sessioning while looking at the ocean, talking about life, and listening to reggae. You can find many J-towners chillen at the East Ferry Deli after a long night of being fucked up. The X-tra mart is a great place to stop by when the munchies kick in. Visine has become Jamestown's liquid from the God, considdering how much of it is used. Jamestown guys normally consist of skater/surfers with shaggy hair and shitty sneakers, along with the clean- cut stoners. The girls are all mostly the same, mellow, beautiful, ... but grungy as hell. Their attire consists of hippie skirts and lots of hemp- jewlery. Ooh what a world.
