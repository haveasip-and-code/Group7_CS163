Morgantown WESSSSST VIRGINIA...home of the famous Mountaineers. Number FOUR party school in the nation. We pregame harder than you party. Where most schools only party on weekends, WVU students can find a party any night of the week! Students stumble to downtown bars or house parties to finish their drinking for the night after pregaming in the dorm with their RA and eventually blacking out. Students' at WVU motto: 'I don't remember but i know i had fun!!!' For anyone who is too hungover to start drinking at 1:00pm the next day...students can find 5 people on their floor that deals pot who can help cure their pain. So after being cured, dont be surprised to be let out of class early so professors and fellow students can attend happy hour. Don't be alarmed if you see one of your professors at the porn shop next to shooters or buying you a shot at lazy lizard. GET A GOOD PHONE because students at WVU know the bar specials better than their friends numbers AND you WILL go thru 5 phones first sem...(hint: dont drop your in the cup while playing beer pong (Bianca), flush it dont the toilet (Abi), or drop it in the snow while stumbling back from the bar (Katie). If you really want to experience the best 7 years of your life...come join us at WVU....apply today for your opportunity at greatness!!!! ; ps...we love beer, liquor and pot....and we dare you to visit...most cant keep up!!!!!
