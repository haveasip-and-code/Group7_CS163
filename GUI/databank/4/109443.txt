Flying Spaghetti Monster
The deity of the Flying Spaghetti Monsterism religion, created as a mockery of the decision to teach intelligent design in schools. Followers call themselves 'pastafarians' and believe that the FSM created everything, and hid it behind scientific data. In this religion, every friday is a religious holiday, all prayers end with RAmen, and the heaven has a stripper factory and a beer volcano. Global warming is explained by the decline in the number of pirates since the 1800's, and therefore the increased number of violent hurricanes is also caused by the lack of pirates since hot water makes hurricanes. and the term 'pirate' does NOT refer to music pirates, since real pirates used swords.
