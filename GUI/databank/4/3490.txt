Linkinball Z
The name reffering to the ungodly amount of [AMV]s that feature clips fom [Dragonball Z] set to a song by [Linkin Park]. ; Supposedly, people make Linkinball Z AMV's because the 'Action in the music reflects the action in the Anime'. Bullshit. The only reason people make them is because [Dragonball Z] is the only Anime they can watch and [Linkin Park] is the only music they can listen to (because all of their friends are watching and listening to it). ; Generally, Linkinball Z AMVs are done poorly because the people making theme are new to Anime...and to the music industry.
