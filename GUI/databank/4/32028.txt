American Refusal To Believe
When the american people/nation refuse to believe that there nation has been involved in illegal activities and attacking countries that posed no threat to them. These people who suffer from ARTB will blindly protect their beliefs with the strength and insanity of an insane religious zealet. Deep down, we pity them.
