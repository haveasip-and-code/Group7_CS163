straight white male
The most oppressed ethnic group in today's American society. [Feminazi]s, Affirmative Action, and the new form of [equality] have caused this large minority to be constantly told that they are inferior (especially to women). Remember, everyone else must get special treatment (especially the gays) and receive favors and money (especially the racial minorities) for free because they're unique and different. Anyone who disagrees with this statement is nothing but a prejudiced bigot. It is selfish to stand up for your own people and not worry about others, right MLK?
