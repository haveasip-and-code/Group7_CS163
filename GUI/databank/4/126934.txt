broke baller
A 'hustler' that don't know how to stay in the game- usually carries the only $500 to their name with them at all times to look ballerific. A 'hustler' that does more shit talkin on the block than hustlin- has no car, but ALL the latest gear (sometimes not even that), and talks about the 'game' constantly.
