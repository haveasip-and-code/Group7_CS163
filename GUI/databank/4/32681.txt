7.9['ed]
A score given to a popular video game from other forms of media by a popular website, screwing it out of a score of 8, considered the satisfactory score for a game to get to be considered good. The term can mean lame, or 'owned' when used in the context of 7.9'ed. It is considered the worst score imaginable; worse then 0.
