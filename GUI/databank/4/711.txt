Silverchair
Three faggy boys who are from my hometown, Newcastle, Australia. ; They started off making fag rock, about faggy subjects like not having a girlfriend and being a fag in general, but then when they realised they didn't have enough money, they dumbed down their music to slow boring wuss pop. ; They continue to make wuss pop to this day.
