Mercy Girls
A girl who not only attends Mercy, but has a ridiculous amount of school spirit and pride. As much as she whines about the school, she would never leave. Because the real world is nothing like Mercy, and any time the Mercy Girl leaves, she's got the urge to grab her Herve Chapelier tote and run like hell back to those auditorium doors.
