Porker-Pig
Being fat. and remember, if you are skinny, you can still be fat... like cutting in line at mcdonald's just cause you are hungry and fat.... eating your food before you leave any drive-thru...un-buttoning your pants after a meal...asking for no ice in your drink at a restaraunt because ur fat and want more soda....accidently taking a big bite of ur finger instead of ur food...if people at a fast food restaraunt i.e. McDonald's know you by ur first name... now thats a Porker-Pig for you.
