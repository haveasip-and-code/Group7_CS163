seXXY
Just like other poster mae says: ; An attractive person of indeterminate gender who appears to have the 'XXY' chromosome arrangement. Most often used to describe women who, though fashionable and made-up, look a bit manly. ; To which I add: ; Popularized by the They Might Be Giants song about hermaphrodites. Unfortunately , a lot of people who heard the song didn't actually listen to the lyrics, and think 'sexxy' is just a synonym for sexy.
