Crofton
A small town in Maryland, full of rich preppy white kids. People in the next town over do not know what or where Crofton is. The Mews is the only non-whitebread neighborhood in the town, it's an appartment complex full of ghetto-wannabe black kids with proficient parents who worked hard to get out of the hood, while their kids want to be in it. Also where the infamous snakehead fish was found some three years ago.
