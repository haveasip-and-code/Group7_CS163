free yayo
A phrase used by [G-Unit], that refers to the incarcerated rapper [Tony Yayo]. Yayo and 50 grew up together. Tony was incarcerated twice. First he was sent to jail for having an unregistered gun, and being around a murder crime scene. After being released, he was arrested again for having a registered gun in his car (which is illegal). He was sent away for two years, and he is now coming back with a new album in 2005.
