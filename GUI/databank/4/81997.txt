CSI
CSI stands for 'Crime Scene Investigation,' which as the name implies are a group of individuals, usually forensic scientists, within a police force who examine and process a crime scene and the evidence found there. It is also a show on CBS with reruns on SpikeTV. There are three forms of the show: CSI, CSI: Miami, and CSI: New York. Many claim that CSI is CBS's stylized response to the show [Law & Order] on NBC. However, the television show is just a glamorized, more 'viewer friendly' view of the real CSI job. ; (Taken from www.vgcats.com) 'In the normal world, CSI, or Crime Scene Investigators, collect and analyze information on a crime. Their findings are then passed on to the detectives and other authorities as the criminal case makes its way down the system. However, in TV, show the CSI investigators take on nearly all aspects of the case. Even arresting and interviewig suspects. Making them some sort of Judge Dredd enforcement officer. A complete package of Judge, Jury, and Executer.'
