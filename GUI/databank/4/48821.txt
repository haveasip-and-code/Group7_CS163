Walnut Creek
An almost all white, small town with little to do but sample music at Barnes and Nobles. On occassion, a group of cool people will form a circle in front of Andronico's Market to talk about the people walking by. If you're not rich, on some expenssive drug, or a poser, you don't live in DUBB CEE!
