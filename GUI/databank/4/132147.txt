silks
'Silks,' or 'the silks,' is a slang term used to describe an item of great worth--typically dropped from a 'boss' in an RPG video game. ; The term originates from 'The Silks of the Victor,' the unique Ancient Plate from Blizzard's masterpiece Diablo II. Legend holds that this item could only be dropped from Diablo himself, but only few mortal men have had the mettle to challenge and defeat the beast. ; In some circles, this term has been expanded to describe items acquired in real life.
