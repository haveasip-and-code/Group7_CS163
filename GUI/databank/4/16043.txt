Best Friends
The person who you can always count to be there and catch you when your at your worst. Someone who knows all your secrets and silly little crushes. That person you can have a horrible fight with then go shopping for matching bracelts half an hour later. That one person you sit in her room all day jumping up and down listening to Dashboard confessionals singing your heart out with a mouth full of peanut butter. =) I WALOVE you. <3 Forevers and evers.
