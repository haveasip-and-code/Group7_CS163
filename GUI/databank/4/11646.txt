NFL
1) The National Football Leauge (where 'sweaty overpaid millionares' engage in highly athletic activity, yell at each other, then go party after the game and get arrested). ; If you want to see REAL football played, complete with rivalries, enthusiastic student fans, and marching bands that kick a$$, watch it at the college level instead. ; 2)The National Forensic Leauge, which holds organized high school debates. They are, as stated in other entries, primarilly held on Saturdays at a host school and less, and there usually is some overpriced food being sold there. The events often run late and it can take forever to find out who won what. In addition, you tend to be required to dress 'nicely' (the definition of this word itself is up for debate). ; That said, there are tons of events and really something for anyone interested in speech and debate. Events typically include Policy (both 4 and 2-person), Lincoln-Douglass, Public Forum, Controversial Issue, and myriad Individual Events such as Original Oratory. If you're a drama kid, love to argue, or love the nuances of politics, there's bound to be an event you'll excell in. ; Many high school kids are highly dedicated to the oft-overlooked art that is debate. They are willing to put up with sometimes badly organized events, possibly unfair or biased judges, and teams who engage in ridiculous behavior just for the joy that comes from knowing you've owned the other team, coupled with the joy that it will look good on your college applications. ; Besides, can the football team use words like 'inherency', 'solvency', 'kritik', 'DA', and 'counterplan' in normal conversation? Yeah, I didn't think so.
