geoslaves
A new slavery ( huh, as if we needed a new one, anyways..), where goverment workers and company-mules are traced and their physical location is monitored 24/7/365..by the tecnogadgetry they give to these stupes. ; There's even a virtual globe for this kind of task..and experts in the geoslavery field are talking of creating a 'digital geography'; to add injury to insult. Every one under this thing will be 'geo-parsed' (i dunno what the fuck this means..), and electronic privacy can find another planet to thrive happily on. Geoslaves everywhere..welcome to v-reality! .
