balls to the walls
Term used to describe an intense, or extreme situation. ; Origin: In aviation, the throttles (or power levers) are usually sticks with ball shaped ends. When a pilot wants full power, he moves the throttle forward towards the front wall of the cockpit. Thus, 'balls to the walls' meant 'full power'.
