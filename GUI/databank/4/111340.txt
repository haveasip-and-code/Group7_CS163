geek chic
An obvious oxymoron, 'geek chic' emerges from oxygen deprived hallucination in which geeks evolve into actual existence as a sort of technocracy radiating the holy aura of cool. You will find no more crushing an argument against geek chic than Bill Gates, who despite being the richest man in the world sports an apparent $5 coiffure and birth control glasses.
