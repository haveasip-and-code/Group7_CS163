nerdbot
A nerdbot is derived from two words. 'nerd' and 'bot'. When these two words are put together, they form the compound word 'nerdbot'. What a nerdbot essentially is, is a person with no life and plays counter-strike 24/7, only stopping for food and occasional sleep. A person who is a nerdbot knows every L337 word in the L337 dictionary and even speaks 'L337' in real life situations. A nerdbot also relates every real life situation to counter-strike. Nerdbots tend to stick together, so despite what people say, they do have friends.
