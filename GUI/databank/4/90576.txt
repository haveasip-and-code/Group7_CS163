elipster
elitist+hipster= elipster ; person of knowledge like an elitist but looked more favorably upon behind closed doors. people hate him/her in public because they cannot be that cool but when they are alone they secretly wish to be that person. ; knowledge of music and culture through the ages, fakes can only span from 70's knowledge to present true elipsters can cite beat culture and the likes. ; people try to bring them down just because they are in there own eyes not as cool. everyone is in a social uniform, this would just be a harder one to maintain unlike gutter punk.
