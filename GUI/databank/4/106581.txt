console-itis
Describes a [videogame] ported to PC from a console system, or co-developed for both console and PC, that is percieved to suffer from the alleged shortcomings of console gaming. ; Symptoms of console-itis include save points, low texture/graphical detail, poor or no mouse support, lack of gameplay depth, and limited configuration options. ; Presumably, with consoles becoming more and more like PCs, console-itis will become less and less of an issue in the days and years to come in the future of the age of tomorrow.
