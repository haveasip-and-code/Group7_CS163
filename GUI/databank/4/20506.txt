Mushrooms
An abosolutely wonderful drug that releases your mind from reality. You realize how much life up to 18 is worthless and predetermined, and realize just how messed up and weird the world we live in really is. It isn't a drug to mix with alcohol, heat, or rollar coasters. Unless taken in high doses, it does not make you see gnomes running about in every direction. Only wavy images of things that already exist and an unparalleled body high. ; **people who are depressed or have any disorders like being bipolar or anything related should not take the drug. It will cause some the worse times in your life.** ; The effects last anywhere from 5 to 8 hours, depending on how much you eat. While having a bad trip, dairy products should be eaten. It helps mellow down the trip. Taking off shoes and socks and being in natural or fimilar areas away from the public also helps relieve bad tensions. ; The effects of the drug is determined person-to-person. If you think you will have a bad time.. you will.. if you think you are having a bad time, you are or soon will. if you think everything is wonderful, you will be the happiest person in the world.
