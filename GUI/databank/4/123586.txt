slobby chic
The art of dressing like shit or wearing the same outfit for consecutive days or even weeks even though, or even because, one possesses an extreme amount of wealth and because they know they can get away with it. Often, people who subscribe to the 'slobby chic' mentality will complain about 'rich people', intentionally ignoring the fact these 'rich people' generally include themselves, their parents, their siblings, their extended family, and their friends.
