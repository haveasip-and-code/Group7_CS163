Mai A Hee
Mai A Hee is a song made by DJ Lucas Prata, Dan Balan, and Ozone as an English remix to Ozone's phenominally successful song [Dragostea Din Tei]. Although it follows the beat and timing of the orginal, it is not (as many believe), a direct translation of the orginal; nor is it the name of the orginal.
