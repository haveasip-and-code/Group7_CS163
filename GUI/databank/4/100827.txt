Emogirl
an emo girl, hmmmm. jsut like an emo boy, obviously. stereotyped as emotion most the time and the stupid thick rimmed glasses. come on! not all of them or us, which ever wear them. emo girls normally have their fringe to one side covering one eye, wear tight/ripped/fashionable trousers, band tee shirts, pearls maybe. a lip piercing too most the time. bands must include: dashboad, bright eyes, thursday... and bands that no-one has heard of. also has 'complications' due to bad past relationships! erm, yeah theres deffiatly more but too much to go into with out it sounding like a diary! ps - not whores! where did that come from anyway?
