A car which, contrary to mainly US opinion, does not exist and never will exist. ; F2 (Formula 2) was an inferior level and a stepping-stone to Formula 1 - to name a car this would be idiotic, especially by a company that is a Formula 1 team. ; For the past few years, McLaren was concentrating on the SLR Mercedes.
