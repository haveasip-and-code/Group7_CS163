hibernia
One of the three realms in Mythic Entertainment's Dark Age of Camelot. This realm is made up of a bunch of whiners and crybabies who act like they are underpowered, when in all reality they have cheesiest realm in all of DAOC. They also hate Albion, and seem to enjoy teaming up with there secret cohorts in Midgard (another DAOC realm, also overpowered.) They wage a vicious psychological war against Albion on the VN boards, trying to convince the Albs that THEY are overpowered, and need to break up the almighty Albtron and run l33t 8 man gank groups. Albion should be wise and ignore their posting of rubbish and zerg the shit out of them.
