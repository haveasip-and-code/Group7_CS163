Brown University
A member of the prestigious Ivy League and founded in 1764 as the seventh college in America and the third in New England, Brown is a university located in Providence, Rhode Island. Regarded as one of the most elite and selective colleges in the world by those in academia, Brown took the path less traveled in the design of its curriculum. Unlike Yale and Harvard, Brown has no core requirements, placing sole responsibility for an education in the hands of its students. Largely misunderstood by the masses because of its liberal philosophy, Brown continues to be the largest feeder into Harvard Law School behind Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Much to the chagrin of the public, Brown students do not typically misuse the Open Curriculum and are not tree-hugging, pot smoking hippies.
