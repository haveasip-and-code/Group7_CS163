poppy
A small, red box which contains snortable cocaine. It resembles a red flask, only with a switch which, when pushed, opens up a small, obscure hole (it is red so it blends in with the rest of the box) which in turn is equipped with a sort of wire salt shaker. When turned upside down, the cocaine is held up by the filter, and by placing the nostril under the filter and snorting, cocaine is accessed to the nose. Very rare find.
