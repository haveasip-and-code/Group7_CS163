spiggoty
Spiggoty means a Spanish language speaker who cannot command English. Literally, spiggoty is a mocking imitation of 'no speaka de English,' and arose among English speakers in Panama around 1900. The shortened form of the word spiggoty is [spig]. An alteration of spig is [spic]. If the native Spanish speaker speaks English the individual cannot be called a spic. ; 'Spic' has nothing to do with the political label '[Hispanic]' as is erroneously thought.
