Deus Ex
The greatest first-person action RPG ever created. Created by the Ion Storm company in 2000. ; Tells the story of JC Denton, a technology-augmented government agent who works for an agency called UNATCO, and discovers a hidden conspiracy involving members of the highest levels of government. How you play the game is totally up to you. You can do anything, go (almost) anywhere, and talk to (almost) everyone. The voice work is exceptional, the graphics are great, even years after it's release, and the plot is engrossing. This is definitely a game you should pick up.
