calculus
Calculus is a generic term referring to any form of mathematics which has axioms and at least one fundamental theory. Some examples of mathematics that can be categorized as calculus are: algebra, geometry, arithmetic, etc. ; Due to corruption of the definition over time, in modern usage 'calculus' almost exclusively refers to 'The Calculus.' The Calculus is also known as 'Newton's Calculus,' or 'Leibniz's Calculus' depending on who you ask. Mathematics majors tend to refer to The Calculus as 'Leibniz's Calculus' and physics majors tend to refer to The Calculus as 'Newton's Calculus.'
