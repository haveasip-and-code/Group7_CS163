tane
Gasoline. (Contracted from 'octane', and spelled ' 'tane ' in some cases. ; Usage note: this word can only be found written in the lyrics of CCR's 'Proud Mary', and does not seem to be in general usage. Some debate exists as to whether the word 'pain' was intended. If so, John Fogerty's pronciation is so bad that not only would most listeners mistake a 'P' for a 'T', but would go so far as to assume the existence of a new word to do so.
