Lavosh
A piece of unleavened bread found at Southern California restaurant Koo-Koo-Roo underneath chicken dishes. Figurative definition is a codeword for 'let's get the f**k outta here'. Commonly used at parties/functions hosted by close friends/acquaintances who would be offended if they were to learn of your desire to depart said party (usually without notifying the host/hostess of your departure)
