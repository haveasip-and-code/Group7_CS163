heartland
Historically known as 'The South'. ; 'The South' was a very large region in the lower eastern portion of the contiguous states of the USA. You may see a map in the following link: (link is not maintained) http://americancivilwar.com/pictures/comp1850.jpg ; The South was a place which supported slavery, and had a wide-spread cultural deficiency in the appreciation of love, justifiably. The South used slaves to perform difficult manual labor for the benefit, mainly, of the people who 'owned' the slaves. ; Today, the 'heartland' refers to areas of the USA which are still significantly influenced by this powerful history. The heartland is a place where love is secondary to selfish desires. The heartland also consequently has an overabundance of the most unfortunate people: the 'republicans'. 'Republicans', like their ancestors, possess a great lack of empathy for the life around them, causing relative harm and distress.
