GOB
A term inspired by the US comedy series [Arrested Development]. It refers to one of the show's central characters, 'GOB', an arrogant, shameless, self promoting showman. ; In real world terms, 'a GOB' is someone who displays the same classless showmanship, such as the lead singer of a pub covers band who thinks he's the greatest thing since Barry White but can't sing to save himself, or a standup commedian who obviously thinks his material is great, when in reality it stinks. Badly.
