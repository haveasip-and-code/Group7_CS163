Interstate 694
Possibly the worst freeway in the Twin Cities except maybe [Crosstown 62]. It certainly has the two most dangerous interchanges in the metro, filled with weaving and tightly spaced interchanges, at I-35E and also at a huge interchange with MN 51 and US 10. Also has a crappy interchange at I-35W and and a useless dual-signage route with I-94, which is its parent route anyway.
