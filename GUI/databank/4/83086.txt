Abercrombie Zombie
You know who the real Abercrombie zombies, whores, soldiers are? the ones who bitch and moan about it all the time! You see, Abercrombie doesn't advertise, it survives through word of mouth and its incredibly strategic PR. so while all you emo pop culture hating dumbshits look for a scapgoat for your jealous emotions over your highschool 'in crowd' you actually aid A&F as a company by keeping they're name in conversation or even putting it out on the internet! So next time you think you're being really cool or rebelious by bashing Abercrombie i hope you realize that you are just another part of their system, like a gear turning in a machine ironically enabling the commercial entity you despise so much... you are the real drones because you think you are working against it, so just shut the fuck up.
