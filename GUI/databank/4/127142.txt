Mount Vernon
aka MurdaVille aka Money Earnin' Vernon where stars are from... ; Home of: [Phylicia Rashad] (Bill Cosby's TV Wife), [Denzel Washington], [Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs], [Heavy D], [Al. B Sure], [Ben Gordon] (on Chicago Bulls), Lynn From 'Good Day NY' (Fox 5 Morning News), [Misa Hylton-Brim] ,etc!!! ; Borders the Bronx ; Yes it's Ghetto, but has come up. Both rich and average class folks live there. Most hated on city in [Westchester County], and often imitiated..never duplicated. Yonkers, New Rochelle,etc can complain but MV has its history. If Mt. Vernon had as much economic support and land as the other cities, it would be even better!
