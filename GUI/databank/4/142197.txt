Jimmy Eat World
Jimmy Eat World are one of the best Rock/Alternative bands there are. Although they are not _Emo_ like simple plan some of their music is thought to be of this genre. J.E.W's signature song has since become 'Pain' part of their album 'Futures'. ; the name was given to the band by the son of one of the members:of Jimmy slicing up and eating the world like a cake. ; I if you are into Rock and do not know of this band i suggest you start listening to some of their material:-)
