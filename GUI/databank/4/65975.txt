RealPlayer
One of the most obnoxious media players on the planet. Developed by RealMedia, who obviously don\'t know what they\'re doing. Riddled with spyware, opens as fast as a sloth on depressants. Video compression is beyond horrible, don\'t know why anyone still use this obsolete media player. ; If you must use RealPlayer, use REALALTERNATIVE and get rid of all that AOL spam that pops up.
