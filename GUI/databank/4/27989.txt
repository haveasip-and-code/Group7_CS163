fursecution
Word used by tearful [furries] to describe the 'persecution' carried out against them which usually consists of normal non-fucked-up people expressing their distaste for or amusement at the greasy gay fatbeards' dogloving hijinks. First seen in 2001, and believed to have been coined by a [furry] apologist on the [Portal of Evil].
