An Urban Dictionary
The concept of a dictionary consisting of slang terms. We could create on over the Internet so people could post their definitions, as opposed to going into the slums and asking for some slang terms. However, we'd better make sure that this thing doesn't become like a forum, or else we'll have internet-weeners bombarding our 'urban dictionary' with definitions of their friends' names or their funny online pseudonyms. This is gonna be great!
