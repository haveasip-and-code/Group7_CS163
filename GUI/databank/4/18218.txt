quarter life crisis
the time when, halfway to the midlife crisis, you realize that you have spent the last 10 years drooling over playboy bunnies that you have no chance with, drinking enough beer to intoxicate an entire middle school, and fantasizing about a house and car that you could have bought if you wouldnt have spent $120,000 on a private university or two instead of becoming a plumber (seriously, master plumbers with five years experience make 46000 without a degree); also right about the time when college/high school girls start calling you 'sir' and stop thinking you are anything but the creepy dude at the club
