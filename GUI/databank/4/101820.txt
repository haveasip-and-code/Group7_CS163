hug it out
(phrase) ; While engaged in an arguement with someone, and the arguement becomes public ( ie in an elevator and the doors open in the lobby) one person asks 'Wanna hug it out?' and you stop the arguement and continue it at a later time, when it is out of the public eye. ; Derived from Ari, on HBO's Series 'Entourage'
