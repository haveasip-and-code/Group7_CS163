Licking them
A term I learned in the back country of Wyoming working with roughnecks in the patch (oil/gas drilling site). It implies that you are bored and not doing a thing that is worth describing. Literally means you're licking your own nuts to pleasure yourself much as a dog seems to do so at random when he's bored.
