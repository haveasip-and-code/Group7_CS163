Final Fantasy
A series of console [RPG]s developed, published, and released by Square/Squaresoft/Square-Enix. Called 'FF' for short. Final Fantasies I, II, and III were released for the NES, with II and III only being released in Japan. FFs IV, V, and VI were on the SNES, with IV being called II and VI being called III in the U.S. for some reason. FF VII, VIII, and IX were all released on the Playstation, and X, X-2, and XI on the PS2. X and X-2 are the only direct sequels in the series, and XI was the first [MMORPG] released in the series. FF XII will be released in 2006 and XIII will be on the PS3. ; Right now, there is a gigantic argument between fans on which game in the series is the best. The two biggest competitors are FFVI and FFVII. The VI fans say it sticks to the roots and that VII is the bastardization of the series by it bringing RPGs into the mainstream, whereas VII fans say it's a fun game and that it was their first RPG. It is the author's opinion that they are both fun games and that both of them are equally liked for different reasons.
