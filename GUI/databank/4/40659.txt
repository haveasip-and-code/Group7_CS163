Qui-Gon Jin
Slang for the soft drink Pepsi during the time the George Lucas film 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' was in theaters. This term was picked up due to the fact that Pepsi and Lucas Arts had an advertising agreement, which placed a picture of Qui-Gon Jin, a Jedi Master in the film, on the soft drink's can.
