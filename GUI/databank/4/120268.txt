decal
something that adds 20-30 HP to your honda civic, depending on how big it is. the type R decals can add up to 40 HP if used correctly. if you add your name, your ruca's name, or the name of your car on the side in spaced out letters in an illegible font, your car will beat any mustang, camaro, trans am, or other domestic car. the only decent decal ive seen is the SALEEN decal on real saleen mustangs
