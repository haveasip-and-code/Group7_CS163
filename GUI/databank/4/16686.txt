D-Block Doughton
A dorm at Appalachian State University, also known as 'Home of the Headies.' Drugs galore fill the hallways, and alcohol flows like a river from the 7th to the 1st floor. It is populated by quite a variety of people ranging from: sorostitutes, gangstas, 'hippies', kids who never leave their rooms, and the druggies, who have thier own categories. Bean poppers - always doing light shows and disturbing the peace with the bass of their techno from DJs in Charlotte. Shroom-heads 'cidders - These kids trip balls on a daily basis...often seen laughing constantly or uttering the words 'What's going on maaaaaaan?' Favorite movie: Fear and Loathing. Cokeheads - fiending for that white, these niggaz are crazy. Usually rich and sketchy. Adderollers - Adderal poppin motherfuckers, can't study without it. Also used in combination with other drugs for the bored. Pillpops - Listen to Lil Wyte - Oxycontin constantly. Xannies for everyone. ; Basically D-Block is where the real niggaz be at. Close with Hoey, rivals with Canon, fuck West campus, East side we ride. Str8 up. Right.
