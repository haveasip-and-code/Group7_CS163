Richard & Judy
(n.) Shitty-yet-addictive british TV show where everything new is considered highly controversial, and the opinions of a bunch of self-proclaimed 'experts' over-ride any court judgement or what the facts clerly point to. Presented by a nice bi-sexual man called Richard, and a half-woman, half-cartoon fish called Judy. ; Judy keeps richard on a leash by biting him with her sharp, pointy, filed-down teeth. ; If you like to be a tool of the liberal media, and enjoy hearing one sided arguements, watch this show. Well, I'm conservative but I think it's pretty good to watch, just to laugh at the fucktards, and listening to the odd cool guest.
