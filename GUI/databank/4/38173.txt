peer pressure
a phrase that the weak minded use to donate the fact that they did something stupid as hell because 'all their friends where doing it' and they 'just wanted to be cool'. ; weak minded teenagers suffer from this alot, constantly doing retarded ass shit because their friends are doing it.
