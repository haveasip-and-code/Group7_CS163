lumburgh
Named after Office Space's Bill Lumburgh, this term applies to anyone in a useless job who's boss makes them feel important-- like coming in on the weekends, or getting dumped with a bunch of reports that are alledgely important, but are really the boss's work that he/she doesn't know how to do.
