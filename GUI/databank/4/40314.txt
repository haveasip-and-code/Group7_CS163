transdyke
A self-identified [lesbian] or [dyke] who happens to have been born with the birth defect of a wholly or semi-operative penis. ; This term can sometimes be applied to such a person after said birth defect has been altered by means of corrective surgery, but is more appropriate before such repairs have been undertaken.
