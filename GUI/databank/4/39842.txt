deuce brothers
A band of brothers who wreak havoc and take names and are frequently caught on video and star in indie movies (the trio first hit the big screen in 'A Lucky Day in Hell'). ; Known by their fingerless black leather gloves, their distinctive gang sign (ring finger and pinkey finger pointing in the air), drunkenness, unnecessary gunfights, and tipping over large objects. Known as the 'deuces' because there are three brothers.
