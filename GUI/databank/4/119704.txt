art kid
One of those kids you usually see in middle and high schools (the age when people start to assert their individuality) who are awesome at art, take as many art classes as they can, and are constantly drawing, painting, or photographing something. They often may be drawing on themselves or their belongings with [sharpie] marker. ; Many also are highlly individualistic and may choose to die their hair interesting colors, cut it it strange ways, or dress in a rather offbeat manner. Many also started various trends (such as wearing Converse shoes) before they became mainstream. ; Some are into theater or the performing arts. They are sort of a high school version of [bohemians]. (meant in the nonconformist sense of the word) ; NOTE: (not at all to be confused with [emo kids], as this is a totally different idea, though some art kids are emo and some emo kids are artsy in nature.)
