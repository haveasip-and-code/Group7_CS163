tudge
A very brief communication, all too common in the SMS/ email age. ; Formed by combining 'touch' and 'nudge', to replace the word 'touch' in the sentence 'Get in touch'. ; Where 'touch' suggests meaningful possibly extended contact, 'nudge' implies a only the most cursory attempt at communication.
