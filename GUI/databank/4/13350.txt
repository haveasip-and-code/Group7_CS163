Smelliott
A Smelliott is a creature that is half man half Secretary Bird due to the extreme frailty and 'string-like' appearance of the calf muscles. In addition to this, A Smelliott has an extremely dirty and odorous 'durf' or 'taint' due to that area of the body not being washed or cleansed for extended periods of time (usually for more than one year).
