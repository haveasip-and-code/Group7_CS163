Super-China
The Dominion of Super-China is a large, safe nation, renowned for its compulsory military service. Its hard-working, cynical population of 26 million are ruled by a mostly-benevolent dictator, who grants the populace the freedom to live their own lives but watches carefully for anyone to slip up. ; The large government juggles the competing demands of Defence, Education, and Law & Order. The average income tax rate is 21%, but much higher for the wealthy. A powerhouse of a private sector is led by the Automobile Manufacturing industry, followed by Trout Farming and Arms Manufacturing. ; Military spending is on the increase, refugees from other nations are flocking to Super-China's border, the mining industry has taken a hit from tighter environmental regulations, and there's a shortage of swinging hot spots as land development grinds to a halt. Crime -- especially youth-related -- is well under control, thanks to a well-funded police force and progressive social policies in education and welfare. Super-China's national animal is the fugu fish, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the uranium peso. ; (Nationstates.net, copyright Max Barry)
