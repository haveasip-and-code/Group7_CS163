Actually Mocha, you and your friend think I'm [lunar shadows], where I'm not him. Actually hun, I'm a chick. ; You also said him and I post the same way. That's obvioulsy false because if you compare his definitions, like [chocolate chips] and [dinky little] to mine, you can tell we're not the same person.
