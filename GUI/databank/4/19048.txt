Sitka
Sitka is the former capital of Alaska and the place where a sly fox of a man named Seward basically stole the afformentioned Gloryland from the Russians. The capital has now been moved to Juneau, but Sitka remains a Mecca to tourists and kelp alike. Perhaps it's the intense level of beauty, perhaps its the intense shoddiness of everywhere else in the world; something sets Sitka apart. ; (Perhaps it's the ocean...) ; According to rock music legend Bono, the word 'Sitka' is thought to have been derived from an almost unintelligable line of lyrics in a popular Depeche Mode song. However, the origin of 'Sitka' as word is still under hot debate, most citizens of the contiguous US believe it comes from the sound trees make when they explode during a spring thaw. Still others argue that is actually from the Alaska Native phrase, Shee-Atika.
