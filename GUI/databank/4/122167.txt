Roberto Cavalli
A favoured choice for many Hollywood stars, Roberto Cavalli is a haute couture designer with a philosophy of standing out from the crowd--through the use of bright colours, abstract designs, and animal prints. Once considered quite 'strange' and controversial amongst the fashion community, Cavalli is now a leader in the fashion industry, and his couture isn't afraid to flaunt it.
