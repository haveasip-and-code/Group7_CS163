Chestnut Hill
A upscale neighborhood in Philadelphia. Really an extention of the Main Line, but everyone there thinks they are better, because unlike the Main Line, Chestnut Hill has a large liberal population. It is an area filled with money, but subtly. There are a lot of hidden, huge, well manicured homes. All the kids go to CHA, Springside, Germantown Friends School and a few other well know private school in the area. Look out for the police who are constantly trying to break up parties with out doing anything to the kids and their fancy cars. Preppy is in style. If you have a car and are a teenager, the Wawa parkinglot is the place to be seen pre party on friday and saturday night, especially since the main road, Germantown Ave. is dead by 10.
