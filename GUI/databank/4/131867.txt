bonzai
Believed by many to be the greatest adjective in existence. It has been described by linguists and etymologists as 'aestethically pleasing' and 'beautiful' as well as being the most highly evolved word in the English language. Recent evidence shows that the word derived from the sitcom Bonanza, which apparently sucked, unlike the word it begot.
