bus tunneling
a great game in which all of the people on a school bus put their backpacks in the center aisle to hide the floor (the surveilance camera can now not see the floor completely), and a person tries to get from one end of the bus to the other underneath the seats (or really any distance). ; this activity can get you slammed with fines, juvy, or at least bus expulsion; only to be played under the lack of supervision of a substitute bus driver.only play when people who you know are above you, because people you do not know may try to kick you(it would suck nad you might get stuck) ; i have personally played it and it's awesome.
