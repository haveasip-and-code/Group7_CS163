WIGS
WIGS (wigs) White Italian Greasy Slobs. This organization was created shortly after the development of [WICAP] by Liam Ireland in order to create a group to which a Bobby Italy would truly feel at home. This organization has no potential and is really a knock off parody of the ever beloved [WICAP]. Nevertheless they press on under their leader, Bobby Italy. Italy, being an open homosexual, has partaken in practices that have conflicted greatly with his leadership. (i.e. Boy George developing a leadership role in the organization.) For some of these reasons, WIGS is stuggling on the brink of implosion. And sadly, there is no bright future in store for the WIGS within their homeland. This is mainly due to their name which offends many Italians, most of whom have condemned Bobby Italy, calling him a heretic of sorts. However, though WIGS do not look to have a large following within their country of origin, there seems to be a large French following associated with the group. Thus, their future is unclear as WIGS frolicks into the mid twenty-first century hopping from one European country to another.
