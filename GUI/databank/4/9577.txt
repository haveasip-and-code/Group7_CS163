Nu Metal
a type of music that when mentionned compels any moronic [metalhead] to spew forth mind-numbing nonsense about why his music is better, whining in the manner of an 84-year old man about the 'good old days' and generally boring everyone to death. It regroups music from groups like Korn, System of a Down, Slipknot, Linkin Park.
