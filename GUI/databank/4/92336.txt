good hair
A popular term in the African-American community, used to describe an black person's hair that closely resembles the hair of a typical white person (i.e. soft, managable, long, as opposed to 'nappy' or 'bad' hair). The closer your hair is to a white person's, the 'better' your hair is. See: 'bad hair'. ; Note: Most people who use this term would never admit the inferiority complex from which it came.
