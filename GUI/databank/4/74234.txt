hitting a deer
If you are on your way to get some poontang from RAH and you suck at driving, you're driving fast, and it's on a gravel road (which you're pretty screwed)you'll most likely wreck so then you have to tell your mommy you were in the process of 'hitting a deer'. So then everyone will make fun of you, and they know what truly happened and you have only owned your truck for a little over a week and then you have to pay $1,000 cuz you 'hit a deer'.
