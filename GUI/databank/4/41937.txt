Happy Harry's
A drug store where the employees are underpaid and usually experience some kind of sexal harrassment during their employment. They wear bright turquoise vests and answer the phone accordingly, 'Thank you for calling Happy Harry's (enter location here). thi is (employee name here) how may i help you?' This over-charging drugstore, with a fully stocked and functional pharmacy, is run by none other than 'Happy Harry's' son, Alan Levin, who's wife pretty much does his work for him.
