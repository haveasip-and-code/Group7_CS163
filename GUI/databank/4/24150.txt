rot in hell
What people always shout to others while theyre alive but at their funeral, you rarely hear anything but nice compliments. Just once id like to see osmone at a funeral say 'This guy was a greedy fuckface and i sure hope that his death hurt him in extreme ways, fuck you you son of a bitch, rot in hell!' and then spit o nthe corpse so the wrinkled odl women at them can make fainting noises and pass out.
