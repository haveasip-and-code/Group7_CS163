Jehova's Witness
A splinter movement of the Jehovah's Witnesses that considers excess of 'H's to be an abomination before the Lord. Jehovah's Witnesses believe their group to be founded on a spelling error, but Jehova's Witnesses know that is just the sort of blasphemy those H-lovers would resort to.
