backwards racism
Thise maybe tough to understand but help me out here. Backwards racism is when a race (usually white people) is shown no 'special' treatment. As in they are considered basic and therefore have no heritage etc... Don't believe me? Think about this:ever see any sort of heritage events for white people? Ever see any sort of special clubs at school for white people? If you try to start a club and they ask what you are, white won't be an answer. White is considered the basic and therefore deserves nothing extra. Another thing, if a white person says something like nigger or even black guy, he's racist, yet white boy is as bad as those two, considered normal. White people are a race and should be treated like one.
