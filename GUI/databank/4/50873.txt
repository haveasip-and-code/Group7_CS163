black knight
While images abound of evil black knights rampaging the countryside, these tales are far from the truth. A black knight is a knight not sponsored or employed by a local lord for the defense of his lands. Therefore, the black knight does not have at his disposal the resources needed to keep his armor polished and in good repair. To save face, these knights painted their armor black, to hide any wear and tear that the armor may have endured.
