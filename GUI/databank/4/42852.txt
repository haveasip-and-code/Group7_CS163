care bears
A series of popular animal characters from the 1980s. They started out appearing on greeting cards in 1981, but became a line of stuffed toys and a cartoon in 1983. They were popular through much of the 1980s, but died out in the early 1990s. They have made a comeback today however. The Care Bears appear as multicolored bears with various symbols on their tummies that illustrate their personalities and caring missions.
