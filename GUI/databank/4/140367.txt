3 Inches of Blood
The most refreshing and original metal band in the last 10 years. This combination of Cam Pipes shrieking vocals and Jamie Hoopers growling vocals make a for a very a satisfying duel vocalists. There lastest album, Advance and Vanquish, is nothing more than a album full of in your face metal and and a can full of ass kickery. Their two most famous songs, 'Deadly Sinners' and 'Balls of Ice,' will make you bang your head. There lyrics are a combination of Iron Maiden and Dungeons & Dragons are the most satisfying lyrics to hear in years. Some may call them lame, but they are fucking pussies. Listen to this band and get your face kicked in. They will flourish for years to come and I hope they never become sucked into mainstream ala. In Flames or Metallica
