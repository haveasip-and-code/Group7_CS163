hood dunce
a white hipster who has never been to the ghetto, likes to talk like Black people, has no Black friends, listens to gangster rap music and still dresses in Abercrombie & Fitch and lives in a suburban household with racist parents. 'Hood' refers double meaning of neighborhood and KKK headgear. 'Dunce' refers to the ignorance as well as the pointy hats worn by KKK. Very often hood dunces are unaware of their ignorance, laughing it off with, 'Its cool, bro!'
