thumbtext
Form of shorthand used when sending text messages on cell phones. ; Thumbtext is critical in order to efficiently communicate with someone when trying to type words on a keypad that uses 8 keys to sum up the entire alphabet. ; When you're driving on the freeway, there just isn't time to type out all the letters of every word. Thumbtext is the solution. ; An even more time-efficient way to communicate is to use that keypad's numeric characters to enter a person's phone number then hit the TALK/SEND key.
