After winning the Miss Chinese-America Pageant in 1991, two years later Lee returned to Hong Kong long enough to take second prize in the New Talent Singing Contest (the Asian equivalent of Star Search), resulting in a recording contract with Capital Artists; her Mandarin-language debut Love From Now On featuring the smash hit, I Am Still Your Lover, appeared in 1994, with the follow-up Promise Me trailing just months later. A series of releases including the English-language Brave Enough to Love, Yesterday's Passion (her Sony label debut) and Sincere launched Lee to the top of the Far East pop charts, and in all she issued a dozen albums prior to making her stateside debut in early 2000 with Just No Other Way. Lee got her reputation in the states for her appearance on the 73rd annual Academic Award for the theme song - A Love Before Time of movie Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. -- Original bio courtesy of Jason Ankeny (All Music Guide), edited by COCOLEE.NET
