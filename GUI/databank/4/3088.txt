R.Shogan
The 'R.Shogan' is short for the Royal ; Shogan, based on 2 words previously defined, where the [Rogan] is the 'perfect or aptly named royal grogan', while the [Shogan] is the 'shithouse grogan' which ; doesnt get accepted by the crapper. ; Now before you start saying, This ; is a Paradox, you've gone nuts, i submit to you the following arguement: A [grogan] can be so perfect, so outstanding in size and granduer, that the dunny can't actually handle it, and thus treats it as a [Shogan]. Hence the much awaited term R.Shogan.
