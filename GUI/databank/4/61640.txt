KISS
a 70's rock band. they got big in 76. the original line up was Peter Criss(drums) Paul Stanley(rhythm guitar) Gene Simmons(bass) and Ace Frehley(lead guitar). they wore tight leather outfits, usually with rinestone-like things on it with 7 inch heels. they each donned a personality they showed through their face paint. Peter was the Catman, Paul was the Starchild, Gene was the Demon, and Ace was the Space Ace. they had a few cds that didnt make it big. KISS was known for its live show. the explosions, fire breathing and such. it wasnt until they released KISS Alive, a live cd, that they made it big. there was a cornicopia of merchandise from KISS lunchboxes, action figures, magazines, condoms, to the most recent KISS-opoly(a KISS monopoly). It may seem they were having a good time, but nothing good ever lasts. in the late 70's Early 80's, Peter Criss was increasingly unhappy with the way KISS was going. he left the band and was replaced with Eric Carr who was The Fox, a closeness to the Catman.Carr would die of cancer later. after Peter left, so did Ace. he was replaced with Vinnie Vincent, who was the Warrior, with an Ankh on his face. after the short lived new line up, KISS needed something new to boost the new changes. they went unmasked. without makeup, they went on to make many albums (in my opinion not as good as the ones in the 70's). when Carr died, he was replaced with Eric Singer. Vinnie left, replaced by Mark St.John. after Mark left, he was replaced by Bruce Kulick. after all the ups and downs, the original line up came back for a reunion tour. after KISS got into the swing of touring, Ace was working on a solo albumn and decided that he couldnt just leave it for KISS. Ace was then replaced by Tommy Thayer. they did a tour with Aerosmith and Peter decided to leave once more. he was replaced again by Eric Singer. that is the latest linup, Paul, Gene, Tommy, and Eric.
