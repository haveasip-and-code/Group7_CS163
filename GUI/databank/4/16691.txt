maw
Maw is a common Scottish word for mother, however it can be used in many other situations where 'mum', would not be at all appropriate! Instead of saying 'No, I don't agree with that', one can simply say 'Aye, yer maw', and walk away - by far the superior choice for those busy those of us with have more pressing matters to attend to.
