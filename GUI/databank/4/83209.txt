Wakka
One of the Characters in Final Fantasy X who is somewhat...idiotic and level headed. he is usally the concious of the group and does hae a accent and a annoying tendency to say ' bruddah' a lot. At one point was a big huge part of the story line but after you win or lose the blitzball cup...well..he just is another useless fighter who needs training
