Phenolphthalein
Don't forget that Phenolphthalein is also used as a laxative. If ingested, even in the concentrations generally found in a high-school or college-level chemistry class, it can actually cause great damage to the gastrointestinal systems of humans and other animals (dogs, etc.) Many think this is funny, but it is actually quite dagnerous.
