de-Foley-ate
verb; past tense. The act of removing a sitting House Speaker by voting him out of his congressional seat, thus also removing him from the Speakers Chair. Uncommon because Speakers usually gerrymander their seat to be very safe. A de-Foley-ated speaker is an earlier version of a [gore-loser].
