wheresgeorge
A phrase asking a question, if you couldn't tell. It is also a currency tracking service where you can see where the money you have came from, and let others do the same. If you see a bill with 'See where I've been/ Track where I go next/ www.WheresGeorge.com, then you can enter that bill into the registry, and do just that. It's interesting to see how far the pieces of paper end up going. ; also WheresGeorge, etc.
