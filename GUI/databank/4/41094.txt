Smart Car
A compact automobile manufactured by Mercedes-Benz. It has been available in Europe for several years and in Canada for a year or so, arriving in the U.S. as late as 2007. Its advantage to other cars is its incredible efficiency. With today's rising gas prices, a car that can give you 55 miles-per-gallon can certainly save you a lot of money. True, it isn't the best looking car in the world. However, in a certain amount of time, most S.U.V.'s and other large cars will be replaced by compact cars to save costs and maintain efficiency and practicality.
