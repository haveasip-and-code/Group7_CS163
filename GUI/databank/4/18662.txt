steam-roller
A kind of pipe used in the smoking of [marijuana]. This pipe is a long tube, akin to a [bong], having both ends open, with the [bowl] on top. The far end is covered by your hand, pressing the other end comfortably around you mouth. You inhale the smoke so that it fills the tube (also called a chamber), then you release you hand allowing the smoke to rush into you lungs. Often this act can cause one to cough harshly, wherein the true nature of the steam-roller is realized.
