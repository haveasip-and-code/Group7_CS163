Comtwoper
'Com-two-pa' ; It is a new form of computer design only now in the drawing boards. ; They use 0,1,2, instead of just 0,1. ; 0 = no voltage ; 1 = low voltage ; 2 = high voltage ; These comtwopers will revolutionise the way we perceive computing today. Complex calculations done with supercomputers could be performed on 3Ghz processors. ; Programs will have to be redesigned from scratch to account for another binary digit. But the future of computing looks bleak without it.
