Sonic The Hedgehog
One of the most coolest game on the Sega Genesis. The fastest hedgehog out there, is blue. Now, Sonic is one of the biggest sell outs now, none of the games are completely how they used to be, though the same reason (Kind of like Mario games). Used to have an old cartoon show but now has a new show on Fox (Forget what the morning block is called), new show = shit, new games = shit.
