Sienfeld
Popular TV series from the 1990s developed by standup comedian Jerry Sienfeld. The show followed the lives of four main characters living in New York. It was known as the 'show about nothing', since the plots did not involve conventional storylines and typically did not resolve in the manner of most TV sitcoms. For example, one show's plot involved the four characters waiting for - and not getting - a table at a Chinese resturaunt. ALthough such plots may seem trivial, it should be noted that the show was (and is) widely regarded as being extremely funny. ; A series of involved, random events with an uncertain outcome may be described as 'Sienfeldian'.
