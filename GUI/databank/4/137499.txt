Skar
when a goth decides to drop his/her/its label, they become a skar. it makes sense too, if you think about it.. when goths cut themselves, they get left with scars, and in one way or another, after they end there craze with being a goth, they are kinda scarred for life.. and they OBVIOUSLY thought it was cool to replace the 'c' in scar with 'k', making them the oh-so kewl Skars.
