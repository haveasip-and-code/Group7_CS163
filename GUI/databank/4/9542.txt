English Language
Something people of the younger generation have an inexplicable difficulty in expressing. Most notably the use of 'American English', a degredation of the traditional language where 'peepz speek lik diz, yo!!'. Critique is erronously directed towards anybody with half a brain and the sense to realize that using 'traditional English' is NOT 'old-fashioned' or 'geeky'. ; Conversely, English has already been the most bastardized language over the centuries, having taken many words from multiple languages and confusing the hell out of non-native speakers. But people of today's generation do NOT need to go intentionally out of their way to bastardize this already-confusing language further.
