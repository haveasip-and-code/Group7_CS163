Lycra Pimp
Those cyclist or outdooor types who think weraing lycra is good thing to do. ; and not just content with just wearing lycra, such as a Lycra Bandit, these people try and promote it!!! ; After cycling round country lanes, a lycra bandit would leave it at that, but not a Lycra pimp, these people will walk down the high street wearing the tightest lycra that twiggy never would have squeezed into, RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU'RE FACE, as though they expect you to respect them for it... they will walk into a shop, go to the counter, then strike some mail order catalogue pose before asking directions to the toilet. ; Avoid lycra pimps at all costs, I heard one guy touched one and fell into a coma for three weeks... and his hand fell off. (and that was only a mild lycra pimp)
