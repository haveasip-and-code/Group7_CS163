Neeta School
Neeta School is a middle school randomly placed in the middle of the woods. It's a poor excuse for a school. Every little child rides their bike to school due to the fact that Medford Lakes is about 1 mile wide and random trails lead to random places. When we finally move on to Shawnee High School, we are labeled as 'Stoners', this is because about 98% of the kids that come out of that school alive tend to spend the rest of their lives smoking pot. The kids have nothing better to do so they ride their bikes every where and when they aren't smoking pot they are ordering bread sticks and pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. We like to pretend that we can afford to fix things, so when wholes form in the brand new gym floor, we put tape over it.. when water fountains get ripped out of the wall, we actually don't fix it at all, we just leave a giant whole in the wall. Our teachers have random affairs and harass the kids as much as they can. So thank you Neeta School.
