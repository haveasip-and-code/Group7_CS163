caco
A caco is pretty much the [Puerto Rican] cousin of the British [townie]/[chav] or the North American [wanksta]/[wigger]. ; Their name comes from the greek 'cacos' meaning 'bad' or 'low quality'(Example: cacophony) and was a term in used in Spain referring to a low-life. The female counterpart is called 'caca' humorously enough. ; Cacos listen to [reggaeton] in the same way that [wankstas] listen to [gangsta rap] and [chavs] listen to [garage] but they will also listen to anything resembling the sound(i.e. no talent music about gangs,hos and tha ghetto). ; Caco fashion generally consists of mostly athletic clothes of known brands or anything that makes them look like they're rich(which is hypocritical considering their [inverse snob] [ghetto] behavior). ; Males: brightly colored basketball jerseys wife beaters or long white T-shirts, baggy denim shorts, expensive [reebok] or [nike] sneakers(usually white) or wheat colored [Timberland] or [Lugz] boots and a white or 2 toned baseball cap. When cacos want to dress fine on a night out, they will wear imitation designer jeans, horizontal striped polo shirts and a pair of pointy tan colored shoes([puerto rican fence hoppers]). Preferred hairstyles are usually crew cuts which makes them looks like clones of each other or [corn rows]. And of course no 'self respecting' caco would be complete without a shit-load of gold jewelry mainly thick heavy gold chains with a huge medallion or cross, heavy gold rings and of course an imitation 'blinged out' diamond earrings. ; Females: Are [J-Lo] wannabes so they will fashion themselves after her gaining a look that makes them look like cheap ghetto whores. Generallly they will wear tight 'booty' jeans showing they're panties or tight trackpants or with a shiny writing on the ass or a slutty bright colored miniskirt, tight brightly colored tops with cheap floral designs or shiny letterings on them and high-heeled shoes or sandals. Like their male counterparts they will also sport a fairly large amount of [bling]. ; Cacos are extremely fond of [riced-out] jap cars. Their choice rides are usually [Mitsubishi Mirage Technica]s or Honnda [Civic]s which they will trick-out with fart exhausts, body kits, chrome rims, tacky stickers and of course a [bass] sound system to blast their infernal [reggaeton] music to innocent citizens trying to get a good night's sleep. They also like to ride [ATV]s, [pocket bike]s or [moped]s with radios instaled. ; Cacos do not get along with 'roqueros'([rocker]s) because they stereotype them as devil-worshippers. Despite the fact that they go to church cacos break all 10 commandments(stealing, murdering,adultery and of course gay prison sex) whenever they can so their hatred towards roqueros is hypocritical. ; In short cacos are annoying scum and give Puerto Ricans a bad name.
