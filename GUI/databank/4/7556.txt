minesweeper
The best game ever. Nearly every Windows user ignores this game because it's 'too hard.' But once you get into it, you will become addicted and obsessed immediately. For those of you ignorant bastards who think the game's too hard to learn, read below. ; The rules are simple: You want to uncover all the 'safe' cells without clicking a cell containing a mine. When you click, you'll inevitably see numbers. Each number (1-8) represents the number of mines adjacent to that cell. Using logic, you can determine where the safe cells and mines are. Left-click all the safe cells to win. ; If you think there's a mine under a square, you may right-click it (to 'flag' it) for reference, though this is uneeded. The only benefit of doing such is to use the left-right clicking trick. If you click both buttons simultaneously over an uncovered cell that has all of its adjacent mines flagged, it will automatically uncover the remaining mines to save time. However, when you get really fast, this is also uneeded. With enough skill, you'll find you can solve a board by only left-clicking much faster than you would using the flags. ; Newbies should start with the Beginner board until they've beaten it a few times, preferably under 30 seconds. Then they should get used to Intermediate and eventually, Expert. ; After playing it for a half a year, it's no longer a game of logic, it's a game of 'How fast can I move and click the mouse?' At this point, you should be able to beat an expert game without ever thinking once and still complete it under 100 seconds. ; It's fun as hell to show off to your friends how fast you can win a game. Go play it now.
