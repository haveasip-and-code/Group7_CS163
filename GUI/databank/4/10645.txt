the drive
Short for 106.7 The Drive, this is by far thee worst radio station in history. They claim to 'Shut up and rock' when they really don't. Sure, they play alot of songs, but that's because they suck and aren't as good as Drew & Mike. Also, they play the gayest 'rock' songs like that gay ass, pussy smashmouth song, phil collins, and the breakfast club bullshit. GOD! THAT'S NOT ROCK! Also, they claim to be 'Detroit's official Motley Crue station' when the only Crue tune they play is Smoking In The Boy's Room, LAME. No fags, WRIF is Detroit's Motley Crue station because they interviewed Crue back in 1980 before they got huge! God I hate 106.7. Fuck those idiots!
