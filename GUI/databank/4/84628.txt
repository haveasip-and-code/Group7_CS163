desert fox
Known to most people as the nickname for Erwin Rommel, Germany's most celebrated military genius. Actually, 'desert fox' is synonymous for a terribly obnoxious, domineering, [psycho bitch] authority figure. Also, to alert cohorts that the [psycho bitch] is approaching the premises, one might suddently scream (or whisper, depending on the situation)'desert fox,' and then bow his head and stare at the ground.
