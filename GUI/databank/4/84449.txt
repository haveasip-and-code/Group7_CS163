How Blue Can You Get
Standard blues song popularized by B.B. King. Has the following verse in it that everybody knows. (Anybody who has been listening to blues and knows their Mojo from their Baby, also please note that the song was performed most frequently in the 50s, when a 10 dollar dinner was pretty expensive) ; 'I gave you a brand new ford, you said 'I want a Cadillac.' ; I bought you a ten dollar dinner, you said 'thanks for the snack' ; I let you live in my penhouse, you said it was just a shack. ; I gave you seven children, and now you wanna give 'em back! Oh how blue can you get?'
