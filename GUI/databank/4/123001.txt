Hat Squader
An elderly male who wears a hat when going out in public. An elderly females who wears a guazy scarf over her head. The headwear is not removed in the automobile and is clearly visible while tailgating because you're already at least 10 miles below the federally mandated speed limit. Often times the visible hat is the only clue the said slow vehicle is actually occupied, and may be accompanied by white knuckles at approximately ear level.
