supermarket spartan
They are a very rare breed because people are generally loathe to be associated with Michigan State University. However, they do exist in small pockets of the state of Michigan, particularly in East Lansing and surrounding areas. These are 'fans' who stoop to becoming spartan fans because they 1) could not get accepted to the University of Michigan; 2) do not know what the color 'maize' is and goes with the easier green and white; or 3) think they are rooting for the Trojans because of the image on the football helmets. They outfit themselves with Spartan paraphernalia bought at their workplace, the supermarket.
