urban dic-junky
one who makes attempts to invent a new word/definition; summoned forth from poor creativity; to think it's 'dope' to batter the beauty of linguistics, thus speaking in tongue of such disorganized, meaningless grammar, and sentence structure of spoken language. sadly, expecting to recieve acknowledgements for there 'ideal' efforts... because they're cool, absolutely fucking spontaneous and unique!
