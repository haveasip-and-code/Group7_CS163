sloth
A misunderstood character from 'The Goonies'. When the gang first encounters him, they are frightened of his grotesque facial features. However, when Chunk encounters him one-on-one, he realizes that Sloth is being mistreated by his family. In the end, it is Sloth who saves the gang from the Fratellis. A note to all who think Sloth is the bad guy: SLOTH IS THE MAN!!!!
