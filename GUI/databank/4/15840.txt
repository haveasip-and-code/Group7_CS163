Nero Wolfgang Amadeus Simmons II
A noted Haddonfield composer who has written many works, such as Ode to Dallas. He is a big fan of the Cowboys, and as such his works have not quite achieved fame yet. His pastimes include watching football, playing the trumpet, and competing on the Academic Challenge team with Cashcow and Ezkett. He is a man of few words, but his saying hold immense wisdom.
