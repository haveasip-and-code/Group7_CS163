Email Crossing
A phenomenon that occurs when you send an email to someone at the same time that they email you. Both of you then answer the other's emails and you go out of sync - creating two strands of conversation that occasionally cover the same ground. ; Quite irritating, but not really much you can do about it other than wait for the other person to get both mails and think that you aren't replying anymore.
