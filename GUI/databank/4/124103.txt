Slash fanfiction for the series [YuGiOh] involving Yami no Yugi and Yami no Bakura. Usually mindless lemon, but I've seen it done well. But... They have tried to kill each other on numerous occasions. They'd at least be in denial, and unlikely to be shrieking 'My gawd, Pharoah, you're so sexy! Take me to your bedroom!' any time soon. ; It doesn't mean it'll never happen though... >XD
