ringroad
Ringroad. A word synonymous with many things. Concrete. Congestion. Confusion. Coventry. Many wretched souls have been lost on Coventry's ringroad... ; Ringroad are four alcohol-fuelled fops who are breaking down the barriers of popular culture with their avant-garde views and radical, brilliant and catchy ideas. Or at least they will do, once they escape the sticky paws of Coventry nightlife.
