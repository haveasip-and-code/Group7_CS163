Eton Wick
The [ghetto] of Berkshire. This multi-cultural area is divided into two continents; the northside (often called the shithole) being renowned for its trampishness and being a habitat for [chav]s and [pikost]s. The southside is the more prestidge part of the village, where the rich and famous tend to live. The main feature of the southside is the recycling bank which is regularly set alight or used as a launchpad for fireworks by the Tyson's or other young scamps living in the area
