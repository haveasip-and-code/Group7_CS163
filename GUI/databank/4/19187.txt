Hubba Hubba Zoot Zoot
Derived from the title (and lyrics) of an amazingly obscure song from the early 80's by Swedish group Caramba. Though the track itself may have been relatively ahead of its time....it is crap nevertheless. In fact, it is so terrible, that it actually becomes appealing in a nonsensical way. ; Thus, the term itself has come to signify (in small, music literate circles) the epitome of the 'awesomely bad'.
