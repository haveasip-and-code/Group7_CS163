MMSB
The place on [GameFAQs Message Boards] where users talk about Mega Man, but not really. [Cait Sith Fortune] lives there, and he's a pretty cool guy. So does [Sub Tank], [Lumino], [Paromin], and even more. Sometimes we even get special guests and they leave because they don't like it. ; Once in a while we go on adventures and then we get banned. It's kinda dumb but hey, that's what [Alt Account] are for.
