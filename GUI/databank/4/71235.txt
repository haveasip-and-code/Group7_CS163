reggae
reggae, especially that of bob marley, is some of the most soulful and mystical music you could ever hope to bless your ears upon. it can range from the sweet rhythms and politics of bob marley to the god awful dancehall of sean paul. ; it is mostly hated by the shallow, white, suburban teenagers who can't get past that damned punk rock and MTV.
