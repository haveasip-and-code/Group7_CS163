The Ring
One of the scariest movies possibly known to mankind, anyone who says otherwise is probably lying to look 'cool' as i cant imagine any1 thinkin this movie is anything short of terrifying. Admittedly doesnt make much sense, but the freaky effects and the chick coming outta the well...not the sorta thing to watch home alone!
