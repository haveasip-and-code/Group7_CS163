stupidity ride
Successful investment technique based on recognizing a bubble or fad before other people, buying early and selling before or soon after the peak. The best stupidity riders monitor PE ratios in stocks and how much it costs to rent in real estate versus mortgage costs, and remember that if everybody is talking about this kind of investment, it's time to sell. (synonym: greed ride)
