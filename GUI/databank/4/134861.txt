5th Ave Girl
[Valley Girl] who thinks she is [indie]. She is aware of the fact that she is a Valley Girl, and is somewhat ashamed of it. She has observed the indie kids and imitates them, often going to gigs of well known 'indie' bands, that seem cool to them. She reads both the [NME] and Cosmo magazines. She has a superficial knowledge of indie culture, but is rejected by anone cooler than her, so is not a part of it. The name '5th Ave Girl' comes from the '5th Avenue' club in [Manchester], UK. It is a well known place for 'wannabe' indie kids to hang out, trying to look cool. They wear brand new Converse Chucks and [The Strokes] T-Shirts.
