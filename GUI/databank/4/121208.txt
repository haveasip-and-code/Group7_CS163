cockatiel
An intelligent member of the parrot family that is very affectionate and can learn to talk and whistle tunes. If they are left in their cage all the time they become depressed and pretty nasty. However, if they are interacted with on a daily basis and fed a varied diet they can brighten your life for 20 years or more.
