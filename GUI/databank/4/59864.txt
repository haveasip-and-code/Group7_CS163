the music industry
every one of these bands sound exactly the same. just the same crap that was big ten years ago but a cheap imitation if that. It's soulless, frank zappa would say 'That's pretty white' talent is one thing but substance is just as important and if your just going to mass produce a genre without adding anything to it to make it your own I say your wasting peoples time.
