Our Lady of Mercy Academy
Otherwise known as 'OLMA' or 'Mercy', this is a quaint little Catholic school located in scenic Syosset, Long Island. This all-girls school has been producing some of the world's most fabulous people since 1928. Many people like to make fun of the Mercy girls for going to such a school, but that's just because everyone else is jealous, and wishes they could be a Mercy girl. ; Mercy is open practically 24 hours a day, especially since most of the girls there are so desperately involved in school that they contemplate setting up makeshift beds in the locker rooms. ; The exterior lures prospective students in with its extensive campus and lovely architecture. The interior dates back to 1970 and is in desperate need of a makeover.
