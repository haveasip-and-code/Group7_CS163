Street Racing Syndicate
The worst street racing game of all-time for the following reasons: ; 1. Namco should have left it to the dying 3DO ; 2. There is no 'sensde of speed' as seen in NFSU ; 3. going over 120 MPH and sliding out for turning ; 4. Namco has NO knowledge of the street racing genre..and should have left it to Ea or Rockstar Games ; 5. This game is in poor quality, and could have been made in 5 days by a [braindead labratory ape] ; 6. even though this factor doesnt mean crap to people like me...the graphics are poor and dont even meet PS2 or Gamecube standards
