walpole
Named for the infamous Canadian, N. Walpole, walpoling is the conscious decision to irk the living crap our of everyone around you by constantly pointing out the one thing that separates you from them, to point out that in one tiny area you are a have, rather than a have not. The true joy comes from knowing that soon, the walpoler will soon be just like everyone else. ; 'Dude, Nathan just walpoled me about his damn car again!' ; 'It's an element. That's more like he Dorsey'ed you.' ; ====== ; UPDATE ; ====== ; Also the inspiration for the Fight Club Halo 2 Clan, informally called 'The Walpolers'
