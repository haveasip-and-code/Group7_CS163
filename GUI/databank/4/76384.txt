1st Gear Snap
When one accelrates in their automobile very slowly in first gear, until 4000 RPM's are reached, and the driver mashes the accelerator to the floor. If you drive a Saturn Sl2 or compatible, you will be glued to the seat and most likely have a mental orgasm. When the second gear is reached, the driver will once again crank down on the gas pedal until redline is reached. By now, you are most likely breaking the speed limit and need to calm the F down
