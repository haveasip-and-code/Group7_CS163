led zeppelin
Greatest rock band ever to exist and that will ever exist, at least as influential as the Beatles. Paved the way for the likes of Van Halen and AC/DC. Four members, all of which at least one of the best 3 ever at their particular instrument: Jimmy Page, living guitar legend, Robert Plant incredible vocalist, John Bohnam God rest his soul, John Paul Jones one of the most outstanding bassists ever. Despised the title 'Heavy Metal,' properly: Hard Rock.
