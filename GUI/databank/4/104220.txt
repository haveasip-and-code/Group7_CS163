parkbench
N: Slang term for a rear spoiler that is so big and ignorant that it looks like someone glued a parkbench on the trunk of their car. Parkbenches are commonly found on all make of [chaviot]s and pre-1995 Civics, Integras, Eclipses, and Accords (lowered). Most cars will usually also have an array of non-functioning 'race' gauges across the dash, as well as neon running lights on the ill-fitting aftermarket ground effects body kit. ; If you see a car with a parkbench, enjoy a chuckle but give it a wide berth........driver is likely smoking a cigarette with one hand, talking on the phone with the other, and driving with his lap.
