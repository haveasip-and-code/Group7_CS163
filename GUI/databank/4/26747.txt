surinamese dutch
Just another pathetic attempt by Surinamese to make Surinam different from the rest of the Dutch speaking world. Surinam also likes to change spelling to suit them too. Curacao and the Netherlands Antilles speak proper official Dutch contrary to what Surinameses may think. It is Surinam that likes to change their vocab to suit them and seperate themselves further from Dutch culture.
