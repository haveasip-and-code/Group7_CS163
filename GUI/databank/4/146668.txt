Couch
The act of being all that is vile, corrupt, vulgar, ugly, worthless, revolting, scuzzy, sickening, sleazy, sinful, filthy, horrid, nasty, nauseating. This is the worst kind of filth. Sometimes used as an insult, this describes the person sort of like you would describe a turd that has been soaking in cow urine along with 20,000 dead camel carcasses for 3 years, and is now infected with every disease known to man.
