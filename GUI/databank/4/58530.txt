MF Doom
Is Viktor Vaughn, is Zev Love X, is one hell of a rapper. Metal Face Doom Started out in KMD with his brother deejaying. Zev was a very promising and hip rapper at the time well on his way to stardom, but when his brother died he never quite recovered. ; This important moment in his life marked a dramatic change in Zev's style. Since then he has been a very notable member of the underground and has recently started to climb up the popularity ladder. Hisslow and steady flow coupled with his masterful lyric writing make him an original and fresh rapper in the game today. I'd even go as far as saying that his brothers death is what makes MF Doom such an interesting and unforgettable fellow. His Work with MadLib and Gorillaz is quite excellent. Also check out his many collaboration with folks from def jux and Stones Throw.
