Rockstar Landing
The act of simultaneously blacking-out from excessive alcohol and falling off a NYC fire escape; To complete the landing, one must hold onto the last available handle bar before death is imminent. To quantify as a 'Rockstar', one must climb up the fire escape and proceed to lay pipe in the star struck female. To not seal the deal only quantifies as a 'Pop Star' Landing.
