paste-it
a term used to describe users of the 'copy & paste' technique. they often steal the writings of others and pass it off as their own in order to make themselves feel better about their lack of intelligence. the term was originally derived from post-it notes. reason being, paste-its are just as easily spotted and their quantities are just as vast.
