ellicott city
Ellicott City..(E-City)..inside the great [Howard County] and is easily the sweetest city in it. Ellicott City might have its share of rick stuck up people...but it also has a bigger share of sweet ass people..who know how to party. Very well known for lacrosse..with the 2 best teams in the county in it..[Centennial High School] and [Mount Hebron High School]. That is always the most crowded game in the county and for the past about 5 years there has been one year when it wasnt one of these two teams to win the county championship. So basically I will end this off with a commmin to yeaahaa...Ellicott City is fucking sweet
