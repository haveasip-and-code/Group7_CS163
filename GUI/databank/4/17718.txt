dake-bonoism
Though originally a term denoting an internet spoof-religion, akin to Recreational Christianity, it has, through common usage, evolved into more of a disparaging slur against jubilant fundamentalist Christians in general, and Charismatic Christians in particular. It is aimed at those whose over-simplification of Christian dogma appear to, in all actuality, complicate it. It is a way of saying 'You're world-view is so far removed from conventional reality, that you are not even worth debating.' Synonymn: [clicker].
