dorfus
A dorfus is any human who displays traits of any of the following classifications: [nerd], [dork], [geek], [digerati], [technorati], [hacker], [uber geek], etc. Many believe that the dorfi (pl. [dorfus]) are the next stage of human evolution, the arrival of which has been hastened by our societies ever growing dependence upon the technologies which are understood by this elite group, but which somehow escapes the lower technical understanding of the average [homosapien]. In fact, much as the homosapien's ability to utilize and invent basic tools placed them above the [neanderthal], so does the dorfi's understanding and adaptability to modern technological advances place them above the average homosapien in the modern [Information Age].
