system of a down
A terrible political band no matter what your stance is. They are in fact sell-outs, despite popular opinion. They are currently under the Sony label who also owns other artists like Destiny's Child. Sony uses SOAD to get money from idiots who think they are rebellious to make up for the money the idiots won't spend on Destiny's Child or other Sony owned artists. Many also claim their lyrics are brilliant...counterpoint is below in the example.
