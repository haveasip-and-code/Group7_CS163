animal rights
Formerly believed to be an idea in which animals should be equal to people, it is now widely recognized to be a belief where animals should receive higher consideration than humans. ; Animal Rights means that humans are forbidden to hunt and/or eat animals, and are forbidden to use animals for ANY reason.... ; while animals are allowed to hunt and kill, as well as exploit other animals (ants exploiting aphids for their honeydew, for example). ; Under this rule, animals are also allowed to kill a human for ANY reason (including, but not limited to: predator instinct, invasion of property, protection of young, etc.) while no human is allowed to kill an animal for any reason, not even to rescue his children from a bear attack. ; When it comes to Animal Rights, George Orwell said it best in Animal Farm: ; 'All animals are equal but some are more equal than others.'
