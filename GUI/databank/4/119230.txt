the Aquabats
The Aquabats were a band to emerge from Orange County, California, in the early-1990s, during the ska phase in American culture, which was ruling at tha time. They formed with 7 (or 8) members, and are [ska] superheroes, hailing from [Aquabania]. In 1995, their first album, 'The Return Of the Aquabats' was released. The next album, titled 'The Fury of the Aquabats,' was released in 1996. The Aquabats then hit it big with the hit, 'Super Rad!' A few years later, in 1999, the Aquabats released another album, named 'The Aquabats VS. The Floating Eye of Death!' In 2000, 'Myths, Legends, and Other Adventures' were released. In 2004, 'Yo, Check Out This Ride E.P.' was released. In early-2005, Prince Adam, one of the guitarists and trumpeters left the band to pursue other music. On June 7, 2005, 'CHARGE!!' was released, the best Aquabats album to date! ; One can easily recognize the Aquabats by their quirky costumes. Rashguards, Anti-Negativity helmets, Power Belts, and Vans shoes. Yay!
