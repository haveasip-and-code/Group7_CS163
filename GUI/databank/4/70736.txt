galeton
A town in Potter County that is nothing more than a School and a Lake. You live beside a pigturd and you konw what a pigturd is. You attend a Ham and Leek Dinner and have one grocery store. Theres a Woodsman Carnival and a Lumberman's Musuem. Galeton is currently receiving a new bridge, but until the bridge is back in place the town is in complete turmoil.
