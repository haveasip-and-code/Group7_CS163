Harlequin Fetus
It's not disturbing, just really sad to see an image of someone living such a painful exsistence. It's sad & not scary, it's not something to be feared or nervously laughed at.....it's a diseas but their still humans-there are ppl who look more human but couldn't be more disturbed on the inside-fear & be disturbed by them, not a little baby/human/fetus.............it's the most inhumane thing to do, to say it's disturbing is wrong.
