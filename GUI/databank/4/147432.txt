Tuck Everlasting
A fantastic, fantastic book by Natalie Babbitt. Not a children's book if your association with children's books includes pictures, but a book with some cool concepts that middle schoolers or elementry school kids can really understand. It's about a family who drank from a hidden spring, and it caused them to live forever, without aging (though when they drank from it they had no idea it wasn't just an ordinay spring.) It probably sounds like a stupid, simple book, but it's great to get discussions going (or just make people think) about if you would really WANT to live forever, if given the opportunity. Especially these days when we're not sure what the future of the planet is, would you really want to be committed to living forever, no matter what? FOREVER?
