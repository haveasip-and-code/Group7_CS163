drew carey
(noun, proper name): Overrated, overfed, and inexplicably popular right-wing American comedian--as the term is most broadly applied--who appeals to the same individuals who believe Garth Brooks is a legendary country-western singer, Billy Crystal is a national treasure, EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND is the ultimate in primetime television programming, and Sen. [Bill Frist] can distinguish potential Republican campaign donors from people in a persistent vegetative state.
