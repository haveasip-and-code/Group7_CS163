rap metal
A misconception. It is supposed to be a combination of heavy metal and rap music, but these genres are fundamentally different. Rap focuses primarily on rhyming vocals with a simple and repetative beat in the background. Metal is the combination of fast and complicated instrument work with intense vocals. Hence the two genres cannot mix.
