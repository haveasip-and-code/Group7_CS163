Acoustic Black Metal
The most satanically blasphemous type of music known to exist. It is meant to praise the Necrowizard, and promote his unholy vision of Planet Norway! Some great ABM bands are: Impaled Northern Moonforest, ORGH, Nocturnal Blasphemy, Fjord of Fury, Morkk Pikk, Satanic Necrokvlt Lord, Inverted Blasphemous Moongoats of Norway etc.
