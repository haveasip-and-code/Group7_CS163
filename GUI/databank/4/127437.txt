detfig
This is 'gifted' backwards, and is an adjective reserved for: ; 1. the peculiar variety of being [lame] that occurs among intellectually 'gifted' people who should know better. Used jokingly between fellow gifted people (usu. friends). ; 2. those who are actually very stupid (as in, the complete opposite of being gifted). A derogatory term very occasionally used for these people by the gifted ones, in times of extreme frustration or need.
