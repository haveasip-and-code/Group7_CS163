drop kick (Australian slang)
Australian rhyming slang for the word '[cunt]'. ; In Aussie Rules Football, a 'dropped kick' is referred to as a 'punt'. As is typical with rhyming slang, the joke has been moved one step away from the obvious - instead of calling someone a 'punt', the term 'drop kick' is used.
