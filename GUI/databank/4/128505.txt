Houston
A big 'ol city with nothing to do. There's no culture. The art scene is a joke. Most of the live music you find is unoriginal and lame. Was the fattest city in the country for a few years. Home town of George W. Bush. Its Six Flags park, Astroworld, is the worste Six Flags park in existance. ; They sold their old crappy football team, The Oilers, who then became the Titans and went to the Super Bowl. So they put together another franchise with the most AWESOME name ever, the Houston Texans, who can at least beat the Cowboys. ; The biggest industry in the area is oil, the refineries and power plants are an eyesore and make the city one of the cheapest to live in. If it weren't for that, there would be absolutely no reason for the surrounding suburbs to be so rediculously crowded (mostly with Republican tools). ; EVERYONE drives, no one walks anywhere, and only Los Angeles has more air polution. ; NASA sucks.
