Oakdale
Small town in Suffolk Long Island. Predominately upper middle class white folk. Many people believe they are from the streets and thus dress and act as such. Since there is plenty to do, they complain there is nothing to do. Certain cliques are so bored with their own existance they resolve to trying to upset people for entertainment. In reality.. no one cares about them... or Oakdale.
