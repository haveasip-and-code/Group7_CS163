Ssssssshhhptt-flabberyjab
A phrase used when one cannot think of what to say, for example, when the breath has been taken out of your lungs by the look of beautiful simplicity ( you haven't seen that, I have, harhar ) or because no words have indeed been invented to describe something ( or that someone rather ) so WOAH.
