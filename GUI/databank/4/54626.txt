DIC
An animation company, which began in France, before opening up shop in the USA. At the end of some of their shows, a kid has pronounced it as 'dick' before, but now, it is pronounced 'deek,' for obvious reasons (and the not-so-obvious reason of its French origin.) ; Known for cartoons such as 'Sonic the Hedgehog,' 'Inspector Gadget,' and 'Sabrina: The Animated Series.' ; Many people did not know this (or just assumed it meant the obvious double entendre`,) but DIC has been confirmed to stand for <b>'Dissemination, Information et Communication.'</b> ; The company thrives today, and an updated logo which says 'The Incredible World of DIC' is their trade dress. Hmm, do I see an innuendo here? ;-)
