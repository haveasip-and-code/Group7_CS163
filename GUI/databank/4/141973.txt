Leveling up your paladin
A colloquialism for masturbation, orginated from the 'World of Warcraft' paladin forums when a certain player wrote an essay on the paladins boring gameplay. He pointed out the positve side of only needing to attack a monster once every few minutes, then leaving yourself on auto attack while you 'download gigabytes of hot girl on girl directly onto your harddrive'.
