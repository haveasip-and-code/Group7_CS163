Wisconson
A midwestern state where: ; Everyone has a fixation on the words 'Don't you know?' ; EVERY winter your driveway freezes over. ; There are about 5 good-looking in the entire state. ; Everyone's mood revolves around ONE football team. ; The Biggest city there is known for its beer (AND has a crappy baseball team named after that fact). ; Is known for its badgers. ; Having dead things on the road and nobody really cares (or cleans it up). ; The Biggest resort area is in the middle of nowhere, and you can't go there half the time cause its too DARN COLD!!! ; The one saving factor of this state? ; Cheese ; I should know. I LIVED there.
