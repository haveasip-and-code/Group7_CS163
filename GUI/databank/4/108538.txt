Big sky is famous for it\'s awesome [powder] and great runs. if you coem to visit Big sky you have to make sure your not classified as a gaper aka tourist. Big sky has no high school so 40 kids get on a bus and drive the most dangerous highway in montana every single day. how fun!!! ; Big sky is considered the rich town in motana but it\'s not true we have a trailer park and red necks aka dirt bags or ski bums. you can indentify them as the people with duct tape all over ther ski clothes becasue they cant afford to buy new ski clothes. the elementary/middle school is called ophir. al the kids theink there the hottest and half of them dont ever know where NYC is. thats big sky for y\'all
