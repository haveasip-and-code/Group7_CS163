peep show
Private viewing booths with porn viewing vending machines, usually located in larger adult book stores, and notorious pick-up places for [cruising] homosexual men. They used to have 8mm movie projectors that showed the same film over and over on the inside of the door or wall at about $.25 per minute. The technology has advanced since then, so that there are televisions inset in the wall, and there are usually a number of selections available. Inflation has also caused the prices to rise to about $1 per minute.
