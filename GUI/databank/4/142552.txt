dutting
An action where members of a marching band or drum corps, namely the battery(consisting of the snares, basses, tenors, and marching cymbals), will say the syllable 'dut' to keep each other in time. Many drum corps and marching bands have all of the marchers dut when not playing in practice, but in performance it is usually only the battery that will be dutting.
