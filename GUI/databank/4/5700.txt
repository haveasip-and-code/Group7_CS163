TMNT
Teenage ; Mutant ; Ninja ; Turtles ; Humanity's greatest legacy, and the most popular cartoon from 1987 to around 1994, which was the time the Power Rangers came into existence and, apparently, pwned TMNT. TMNT then concluded its cartoon series in 1996 with the final episode 'Divide and Conquer'. Then, in 1997, Bandai purchased some of the rights to the TMNT series, and merged it with its Power Rangers series in terms of using the Turtles in live-action episodes, 26 in this series. There was even an episode where they were working with the Power Rangers. ; Now, as of February 8, 2003, there is a new TMNT series. ; TMNT is actually based on a comic series developed by Mirage Studios, but TMNT is greatly known for the cartoon developed by Murakami Wolf. The cartoon eventually became a mighty franchise that sold products of countless kinds, espcially action-figures. There were even three movies made in the early 90's by New Line Cinema (fourth one planned but eventually terminated.....but now pending, and planned to be CG). Videogames were not excluded; [Konami] developed them for the NES, SNES, and Sega Genesis, and most especially the arcades. Konami has the rights to the current series as well. ; Overall, people my age recall this glorious series in their own opinions. My opinion? Well, I think this is the most bad-ass series ever created. The new series is alright, but the old series will always be the best. The old series was loved by ALL, and will always be. ; TMNT should be a reminder to people my age : 'Don't forget your roots!'
