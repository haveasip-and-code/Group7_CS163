tout
a lookout who looks out for people coming when someone is doing something they shouldn't like stealing or having a sly tab; if they see someone coming they shout tout! then everyone acts as if nothing was happening. Keeping tout is an art which must be perfected. The slightest lack of concentr ation could result in your mates getting nicked.
