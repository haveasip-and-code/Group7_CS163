del sol
A vehicle manufactured imported into the US by [Honda] during 1993-1997. Sold in foreign markets from 1992-1998 as [CRX]. ; 160hp DOHC VTEC engine available on the US Del Sol VTECs from 1994-1997, B16A3 in 1993-1995 (ODB1) & B16A2 (ODB2) in 1996 & 1997. S & Si models had engines of varying potency, later years are generally more powerful. ; Received minor redesign in 1996, removing front driving lights (which frequently burned/shorted out), adding faux brake ducts (can be turned into functional ducts). ; Has a removable targa top and power rear window, yielding a convertible-like driving experience. Majority of components are shared with the 1992-1995 Civic. As a result the suspension is first rate. ; Originally designed to compete with the mid-engined Toyota MR2, engine was moved to the front & top lopped off after sportscar sales tanked in the late 80s/early 90s and Mazda Miata sales took off. ; Was plagued by high curb weight due redesigning a hardtop vehicle as a convertible. Structural stiffness suffered as well. ; The [Honda S2000] is the successor to the Del Sol in Honda's lineup, which benefitted from many of the lessons learned with the Del Sol. ; Rarest model years are 1996 & 1997 (1997 especially due to sales being killed mid-year), sales started to tank in 1995 and the redesign didn't save it.
