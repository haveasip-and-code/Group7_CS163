jk3
Third party of the Jedi Knight series (also known as jka), game based on quake3 engine. For some people it's all about an honor code and saber fights, for others it's about shooting rockets and using force powers. It's the only game where rockets have their body and ability to change target's running direction instead of hitting it and where there is something like headshot for explosive weapons. Probably one of most annoying game without any chances for being profesionally played.
