carroll county
Big trucks that are all covered in mud is the first sign you know you are in carroll county! Even the coolest, HOTTEST chicks drive trucks! HOTT redneck/country boys in tight wranglers that have skoal rings in the back pocket. old timers driving from town to town on their old beat up, rusted out lawn mowers cuz their liscense was suspended for DWI. we usually never get caught cuz if the cops come it's only to have a few beers with us or to join in the fun! and who needs real liquor or wine when the laundry mat/carry-out/auto repair/grocery store also sells beer! Nothing like going to a high school whose nickname is Cornfield High! Saurday nights there's rodeos and Friday nights we are in the middle of some random field throwing it down to Brooks and Dunn, Toby Keith and Montgomery Gentry by a hugeass bonfire! And when you just want some quiet time, just walk a little farther away with the cute country boy and watch the stars! So next time you see that Jacked-up truck, covered in mud or that has a confederate flag across the back window, You'll know you're in Carroll County! ; Carroll COWnty Pride! Born and Raised!
