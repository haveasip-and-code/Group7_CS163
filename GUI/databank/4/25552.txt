In Flames
Metal band hailing from Gothenburg, Sweden, that has produced gems such as 'The Jester Race' and 'Whoracle' which is considered by many to be the best melodic death metal album ever. ; The band has become more and more commercial through the years, becoming less heavy and simplifying their music to the point that it resembles the dreaded nu-metal, a change that begun in the album 'Clayman'. ; Most metalheads consider them to be the softest excuse for death metal that exists (along with Children of Bodom & Arch Enemy), just as black metal fans consider Dimmu Borgir and Cradle of Filth to be the worst bands in the genre.
