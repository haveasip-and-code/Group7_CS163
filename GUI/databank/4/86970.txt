cape cod
One of the best places to live on earth, but the old rich summer people that live here for 2 months (july & august) ruin the beach nights for the locals by calling the police on bonfires and such. The local youths that tough out the long hard winters (while the rich old farts go to their homes in florida) love to drink and have fun in the summer, and will never stop for any tourists!
