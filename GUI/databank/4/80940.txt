5 year plan
American undergraduate ('college') degrees historically and typically take 4 years to complete. A person on the '5 year plan' is usually not a serious enough student, who will not have enough credits to graduate within 4 years, perhaps due to dropping classes, changing majors often, or flunking courses (which gives no credits).
