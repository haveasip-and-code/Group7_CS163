Henry Rollins
The former lead singer of Black Flag. Also the former singer of Rollins Band, a super kick ass hard rock band from the late 80's and 90's. Hard Volume would be a good album to buy if one is interested in Henry Rollins. He also speaks out against artists with no soul and politicians who suck. Also a strong supporter of the West Memphis Three; three guys wrongly accused of homicide. Rollins also does lots of spoken word, has written many great books, and played small roles in many movies.
