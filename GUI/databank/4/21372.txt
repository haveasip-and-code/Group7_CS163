Cars that used to be more reliable than domestic builders in the 1970s, 1980s, and part of the 1990s. However, they have assumed that they can build good cars by divine right, and have made many problematic vehicles. One such example is the poor PCV system found on their 3.0L V6. They are also convinced that only an idiot can have a warranty problem with one of their cars, and if you do, prepare for a fight.
