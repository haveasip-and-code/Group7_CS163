whimit
A community website for Russian-speaking young people who immigrated to the United States from the countries of the former Soviet Union. Foreigners (i.e. those who do not speak Russian and aren't from a former Soviet state) are not welcome on this site and are usually referred to meetspot (a site for Americans of all nationalities).
