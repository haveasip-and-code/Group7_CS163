Goon Of Fortune
Derived from the popular game show '[Wheel of Fortune]', this involves pegging a number bags of [goon] to a rotary clothesline such as the very Australian, Hills Hoist. Partners stand around the clothesline and the host (usually in a dress) spins the clothesline and goon of fortune is shouted out. When the bags stop whatever partners, one must scull the [goon] whilst the other partner performs some sort of stunt (running around, push ups etc) come back and tag their partner who stops drinking. This continues until the goon runs out.
