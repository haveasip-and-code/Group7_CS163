quiche-o-meter
A unit of measurement that can encompass anything, and any breadth. Anything you can possibly conceive of can be used on the quiche-o-meter, however the most commonly used scales range from David Hasselhoff to Chuck Norris (or any other kind of b-grade actor, or washed up star you can think of). ; The idea of the universal Quiche-O-Meter was first conceived by a group of Melbournian Uni students who came to the realisation that their cafe served quite shocking quiches. This in turn led to the realisation that anything in the world can be defined as good or bad when compared to different types of quiches as well as to different types of actors. i.e. Chuck Norriss will score higher than David Hasselhoff, but William Shattner will score higher again.
