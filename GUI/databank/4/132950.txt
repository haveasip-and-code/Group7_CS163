whitehat
A sell-out piece of shit in the so-called 'hacker underground'. He loves to believe that he is a 'security enthusiast/security expert', but everyone knows that he's not. Usually steals and leeches code from blaqhats, who are far superior and can actually haq. Whitehats believe in something called 'hacker ethics', which do not exist. This is because of the nature of haqqing. Haqqing was never meant to have ethics way back when, and I know this because I'm not a douchebag or a whitehat sellout piece of fat shit that tries to act like I know shit when I don't. That is the gist of a whitehat. blackhatz unite. let's own all the whitehatz we kan. I'm a pr0ud supp0rt3r 0f pr0j3kt m4yh3m. ; Oh, and for all of you kiddies out there, real hackers can use leet speak if they want, idi0ts.
