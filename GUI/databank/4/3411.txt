funt
noun. ; compound form of 'fat' and 'cunt'. commonly used in place of 'fucking cunt', funt is more appropriate when describing a 'fat cunt' as the soft pronounciation is more suited to 'fat' than 'fucking'. ; The funt in question, be it person, animal, or inanimate object, must possess some 'cuntish' qualities and meet an appropriate size level to justify the 'fat' part of the noun. Therefore, a massively overweight person may be called a funt, based solely on the first impression of their massive girth, and not because of their personality. If somebody is indeed a 'cunt' but does not meet the size requirements to be called fat, or at least tubby, then the term funt would be inappropriate. All in all, the emphasis of meaning in funt is on 'fat' rather than 'cunt'.
