assassin
A large game played over an extended period of time, usually by 10 or more people, and typically set in a college dorm. Players are secretly assigned the name of another player to 'assassinate,' that is, squirt with a water gun when the target is not looking and when no one else may see the shot. When the target is assassinated, the assassin inherits the target of the deceased, thus closing the circle. The game continues until only one assassin remains.
