University of Southern California
Centrally located between Watts and Beverely Hills, the University of Southern California is the home of the Trojans, Fuck the Bruins!!! USC is also home to the rich and select poor kids on scholarship. Also known as the University of Sexy Chicks, this is a ridiculous misnomer, but at least our bitches are hotter than the ones cross-town, Fuck the Bruins!!! The weeks consists of sleeping through classes and eating 'food' in the on campus cafeterias. The weekends are filled with sausage-fest parties, unless you happen to be a frat boy. And let's not fail to mention the soon to be three-peat national football champs. Also see UCLA sucks at everything.
