Staples
Staples is a large corporation that sells office supplies, furniture and overpriced computer hardware. Staples is characterized by its huge red buildings and how it kills off all the small supply stores in the area. Working for Staples is like getting your soul ripped out because everday you will probably want to kill yourself.
