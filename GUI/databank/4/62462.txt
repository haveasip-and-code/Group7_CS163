Evermore
Talented band from Australia/New Zealand who were ruined for many by their songs being played on advertisements for teen drama [The OC]. This meant that 95% of 13 year old females were suddenly saying 'OMG, I LUV EVERMORE DEY RULE DA WORLD! OMG, LIEK, IT'Z 2 L8 ROX SOOO MUCH!' This earned them the tag of 'OC band' when really they should be rewarded on the fact they are incredible live, they make amazing, ambitious and uplifting music and they are three wonderfully sweet and talented men. Buy the album, ignore the 'as heard on The OC' sticker.
