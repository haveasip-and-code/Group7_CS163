futum
Noun-- A term pioneered by Frank Zappa in one of his interviews. Nobody really knows what a futum is, but as far as his fans can tell, a futum is most likely: ; -A child or the amalgamation of a society's thoughts or ideas ; -The center of attention ; -Interviewee ; -Fetus ; It is widely debated amongst the uneducated Zappa fans. There's most likely a past reference or use of the term which we may have missed in one of his songs, but as far as the Zappa fandom can tell, it's merely the result of him living with a bioweapon engineer.
