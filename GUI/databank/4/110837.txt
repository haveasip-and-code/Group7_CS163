Protestantism
A form of christianity seperate from Catholicism and Orthadox Christians. Started by German monk Matrin Luther, who when feeling unsatisfied with the catholic rapings of scripture, nailed his 95 theses on the door of a church in Wittenburg, Germany. This infuriated the Catholics and their Pope. Who in turn sought to have him excomunicated and sentenced to death. But he escpaed them and went in to hiding, where he translated the bible from it's only language of the time: Latin in to his native German. He caused Germany to break free of the corrput Roman Catholics and opened the doors to make christianity more personal. Today many branches of Protestants are in existance. A good rule of thumb is: if they ain't catholic, then they're a protestant.
