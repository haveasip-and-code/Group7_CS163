X-Raided
Notorious gangsta rapper X-Raided was born Anarae Jones in Waco, TX, and raised primarily in Sacramento, CA. Shortly after releasing his 1992 debut LP Psycho Active, he was convicted on murder charges -- in fact, the album's violent lyrics were even cited as evidence at the trial. While languishing in prison, X-Raided managed to record another album entirely over the telephone, a painstaking process eventually yielding 1995's Xorcist. Unforgiven followed four years later and Initiation was issued in early 2001. ; -Jason Ankeny (www.allmusic.com)
