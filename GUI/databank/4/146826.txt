niroism
What started out as a joke by me on Ratedesi.com has become quite popular with people actually googling for it....so thought I might as well add a meaning to it for people to know what Niroism is all about..... ; Niroism is a simple philosophy that goes hand in hand with any religion....It is based on three rules: - ; (1) Live life to the fullest ; (2) Have faith in the person above ; (3) Bring a smile to everyone you meet ; That is the way I live my life.......
