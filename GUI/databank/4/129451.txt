sumgai
Origin - from the fountain pen collector community. ; You go to a yardsale which has just opened and expect they might have a whole load of nice pens, pen parts, etc., and then you ask the folks there whether they have any of those. ; Most likely they would reply 'Some guy bought them all this morning.' ; 'Sumgai' is the short form of 'some guy,' if you become a sumgai, then you're the lucky person who got to those yardsales (or antique fairs, online auctions, whatever) and bought those pricey pens or pen parts for a v low price before someone else came along and bought it.
