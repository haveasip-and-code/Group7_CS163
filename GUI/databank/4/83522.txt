pop metal
Where all the heart, soul and any level of intellectualism is gutted from the genre for poseur bands with their fake emotion, all neatly packaged in a three minute MTV video that does absolutly nothing except patronise fans of genuine metal. Usually comes added with a crossover at some point with an overrated rapper that appears on everyone's albums - apart from other rappers, who despise them for being commercialised crap with no worth whatsoever.
