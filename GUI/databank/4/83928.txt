American Samoa
A small group of islands in the Pacific aquired by American in a pact with Germany. No one really knows exactly where it is, who lives there, what language the locals origanlly spoke before we showed up or that the capital is [Pago Pago]. The only time anyone pays attention to it is when some one is doing a special on sweat shops because apparently that's what drives it's economy.
