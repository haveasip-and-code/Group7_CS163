Planebreak
The act or state of breaking the invisible plane of a man's mouth with a penis, the efficiency of which is judged by the distance that the penis travels beyond the border of the receiver's open lips without the two participants actually touching at any point. Both participants must be heterosexual males with the intent of performing the act for the dissatisfaction or disgust of other males.
