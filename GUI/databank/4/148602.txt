duty free high five
A high five given to an employee at a duty free store. This can be done anywhere at the store, but it is preferred that the act be performed at the drive-thru window (if it has one). No purchase of duty free goods is required. ; Etymology: The term was coined by David Snyder on January 1, 2006 in Niagra Falls, Canada on a road trip to see Niagra Falls. It turns out that this is the only exciting thing to do in Niagra Falls, especially if you are not 19-years-of-age.
