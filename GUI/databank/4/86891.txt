hasbro beard
A neatly trimmed goatee common among young men, particuarly fantasy enthusiasts who are attempting to emulate fashion cues common to fantasy themes. It is named 'Hasbro Beard' because Hasbro is the company which presently owns the rights to the Dungeons and Dragons role playing game. It is often coupled with long floppish hair among particuarly devoted fantasy enthusiasts, but is also common in the mainstream population as a handy way to create the illusion of having a chin.
