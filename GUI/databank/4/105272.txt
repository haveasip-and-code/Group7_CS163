B.B. King
Easily the greatest performing guitarist today, and arguably ever. B can be traced to virtually every blues and rock guitarist, and has influenced such greats as Jimi Hendrix, Tinsley Ellis,Johnny Copeland, Albert King, And Stevie Ray Vaughn. B.B. is often credited with inventing the sound and style of electric blues, and, although 80 years of age now, is still a total badass on the guit-fiddel.
