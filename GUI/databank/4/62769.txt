Mayo dart
Used by kitchen staff in restaraunts as a form of revenge against irritating coworkers (and patrons, if you're daring), a mayo dart is a toothpick dipped in mayonnaise (or similar substance), and lobbed at the offending person while he is facing away, sticking to the back of his shirt without his knowing it's there.
