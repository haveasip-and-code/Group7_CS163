Matte Painter
Matte Painter: a Digital Artist in the Film Industry. ; A Matte Painter is a Digital Artist who creates artificial backgrounds for film and television or even for publication. At the turn of the century, Matte Painters used oils painted on glass to achieve this process. In the 21st Century the same results are achieved using computers and special editing software. This process using computers allows for much more convincing backgrounds (and occasionally foregrounds) to be rendered in much shorter periods of time. Most Matte Painters use a program called [Photoshop] to achieve the desired result although other programs such as Painter or Alias Wavefront may be used. ; Movies like [Star Wars] and [The Matrix] and television series such as [Farscape] are fantasy-themed and therefore most of the artificial backgrounds used in each scene are Matte Paintings designed to convey a fantasy environment or atmosphere. This in turn may assist in selling the story to the audience.
