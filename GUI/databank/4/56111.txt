love triangle
The romantic scenario that often involves two persons attracted to one, or visa versa. In other cases, a 'love triangle' may involve three persons who are attracted to each other in a manner that each person will be sought after by only one other; a 'LOVE CIRCLE'. In any arrangement of the romance, the complex of relationships is often illustrated as a triangle where the three persons are connected by their love of a common individual.
