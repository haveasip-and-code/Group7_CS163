Disney
An infamous corporation, whose sole goal in the economic world is to control every single aspect of the universe. Since their only goal of world domination wouldn't go over with the people of the world, this evil corporation disguises itself as being a 'fun-loving, good-will-fostering, happy place.' WHICH IS A BIG LIE! The Disney corporation is morphing the minds of the world's youth, into something almost 'not human.' And who is their spokesperson? A FUCKING RAT!
