TH White
A great English novelist, most widely renowned for his classic 'The Once and Future King.' That bitch JK Rowling has ripped him off to such an end that plagiarism charges should be brought up against her. ; White went to Cambridge, where he is well known for trying to dick Tolkein. JRR had nothing of it.
