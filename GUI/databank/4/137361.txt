the glory days
A certain time. Where you reminisce the good old days. When everything was easy. You didn't have any worries in the world. No bills, no debts, nothing. Something to look back to and think 'Man, I miss them days'. Going down nostalgia lane and reminiscing your school days maybe, or just aching for one last moment to visit your first girlfriends house, or the house where you grew up. The memories will never die. They will always remain in your heart.
