gunder
(noun) A liquid drink served at the Phi Psi lodge at Cornell University especially during the 1970s. Used as a substitute for other decent drinks in order to save money for the house. Gunder was akin to Kool-aid, but somewhat thicker. It did not come in flavors, so much as it came in colors of which there were primarily two -- green and red.
