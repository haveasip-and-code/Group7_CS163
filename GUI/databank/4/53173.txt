corncob
Once thought to be the source of a medical condition known as 'corncobitis', often associated with old age and which is easily diagnosed by the following symptoms: ; - slow, deliberate gait ; - facial expression of anxiety or constipation ; - slightly bent over posture with prominent protrusion of the buttocks ; Treatment is surgical removal of the corncob. However, research has determined that in many patients, there is no actual corncob or other foreign object in the rectum and in such cases there is no known cure.
