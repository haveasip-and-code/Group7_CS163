nya i go to party
the phrase '[nya] i go to party' was first introduced into this world on Ash Wednesday of 2004, when three friends were walking back to their school from church that halfway the unsatisfied 'leader' of the three friends expelled his anger towards anything possible. And when he got to the topic of the 60% [filipino] population in his school, he started a topic about them, and how they had funny accents and the friend blurted out 'nyao i go to party' but the two other friends thought it was nya and it was then transcribed to that. Only until the next day, did the person who said it, had realized what he had said, and thus the world known phrase to call filipinos was born, [NYA] I GO TO PARTY
