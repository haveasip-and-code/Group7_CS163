THE IVY
One of a handful of LA restaurants where wannabe actors pretend ; to be flush with cash...and proceed to max out their credit cards...in the futile hope that one of the true POWER DINERS will bother to give them the time of day.Sorry kid.He notices ; you like he notices the waiter...only when he's annoying.
