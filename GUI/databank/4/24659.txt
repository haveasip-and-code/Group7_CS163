piconjo
A flash artist on newgrounds. He is widely known on newgrounds.com. The name piconjo came from pico and he just added a njo on the end. ; And to answer the question that the last guy marked as 'an unkown answer', i will tell you why legendary frog and piconjo hate eachother so much. ; No, its not jealousy, here is the story. ; Piconjo anf legendary frog used to animate flash together. They did a good job of it to. But back then he didnt have the account named 'piconjo'. It was somthing else. The name i do not know. Anyway it all turned around when a popular flash called 'FF Tribute - Chocobo Mix' came out. While they were doing the flash together, piconjo did most of the work. All legendary frog did was the symbols. But when piconjo did all the work he had to take off a few days so when piconjo did not notice legendary frog submitted the flash and did not put piconjos name where is says 'flash animated by: ' or somthing like that. Later on when piconjo found out and legendary frog refused to put his name there because he wanted to have all the credit. ; So there.
