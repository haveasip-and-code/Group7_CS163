Male Answer Syndrome - All men have this to varying degrees. Some will talk about what the government out to do to get out of debt with some big words, and other stuff which only sounds smart. When in reality, this said guy can't even balance his own check book. Most men feel the need (and act on it) to sound smart (and are often covincing, espcially to women who usually 'respect what a man says' or they just play dumb and let him yap sounding mystied the whole time).
