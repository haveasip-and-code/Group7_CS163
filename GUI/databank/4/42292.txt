LYNN
A dunghole masquerading as a city a few miles north of Boston. The population of Lynn is made up entirely of prostitutes, drug addicts, drug dealers, illegal immigrants, con artists, pregnant 14 year olds, deadbeat teenage dads, welfare cheats, and vagrants. The only industries that flourish in this squalid cesspool of a city are prostitution, drug dealing, arson, and pit bull fighting. There was hope for Lynn when a massive fire leveled much of downtown many years ago. Unfortunatly several more conflagrations or possibly a dirty bomb are required before this sub-human, third world hell-hole can be salvaged.
