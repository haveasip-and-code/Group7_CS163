Dave Murray
One of the current three guitarists in British Heavy Metal band [Iron Maiden]. ; High up in the Iron Maiden hirearchy, he's second only [Steve Harris] himself, due to the fact that he's stuck with Maiden more or less all the way (1976 - Present), with the exception of a short period they were left without him thanks to a rift between himself and former vocalist Dennis Wilcock. During the time he spent away, he joined up with [Adrian Smith] (now also one of the Maiden guitarists) and his band Urchin. ; He's the one who looks a bit like [Cupid], and could melt the ears of even the hardest of Metal fans with one of his solos.
