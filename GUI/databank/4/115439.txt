mu-tiger
Some crazy chick that hangs around the net with people much older and much younger than herself, singing the virtues of free access to information and the evils of big business and governments and their institutions; also known to some as 'mom,' 'sis,' 'goddess,' 'that crazy bish,' 'that hippe,' 'that pinko, bleeding-heart tree-hugging liberal,' and other terms of endearment or derision.
