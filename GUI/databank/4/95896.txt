dancehall
Dancehall music is different from reggae. Dancehall is exactly what is says - for dancing, mainly in a club (hall). Dancehall is more of DJ-ing concept, with artistes spinning songs on a certain rhythm, (for example, the Diwali rhythm). Dancehall can be often derogatory, but is generally just a lot of fun.
