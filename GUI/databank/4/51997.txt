palsy
A state entered after smoking too much marijuana when one looses his or her fine motor skills and may loose the ability to speak or correctly light a bowl. A common symptom of palsy is blowing into the bowl, an offense punishable by up to 5 skips. Derived from cerebral palsy, the condition that 'the special kid' in your elementary school had. You know, the one in the wheel chair that drooled.
