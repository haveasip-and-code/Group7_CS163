Donkey Kong Jungle Beat
Very unique game for the Nintendo GameCube. Players control DK through sidescrolling levels in his quest to earn beats and become king of the jungle by tapping the bongo drums and clapping their hands. Despite being a blast to play, it suffered from a very short length and lack of a multiplayer option.
