Profe
A Profe is a teacher at a predominately english-speaking school who instructs students in spanish. All Profe's are identical clones of each other, and in order to teach, use the same curriculum, videos, worksheets, and posters throughout the classroom. They all have excellent, but very dry senses of humor. No one is sure where the first Profe's originated, but the most wide-held theory is that they were the spawn of an english teacher and a janitor.
