Bernhagen
Is a very inbred, smelly and POOR family who live in Queensland Australia.This species of Australian often are quite open about their feelings and are often seen trying to hump the legs of the same sex. These random acts of 'Royal Crass' often impinge on the rights of others to lead a normal life. Instead of local currency they have developed there own form of currency, 'Crumbs'. Even with the currency of their own bread crumbs (which are often found on brown 70's style couches), they still seem to struggle to make a living.
