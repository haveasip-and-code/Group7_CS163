Think Outside of the Box
Old - Phrase in office-speak suggesting the use of unorthodox approaches to solve otherwise difficult problems. Not a bad phrase, but too many pointy-haired-boss types latched on to it and used it as a knee-jerk response when asked for input, thus blanching it of all meaning. ; New - Happy-hour phrase meaning 'Get your mind off the poontang - we're talking sports now!'
