Stomp and puff
Police jargon used for the means to render CPR to any criminal individual, or accident victim depending on their looks, after a life threatening event brings about their demise. ; Stomp and Puff is rendered at a distance of 5-6 feet from the 'problem' and is accomplished by stomping on the ground as close to the 'person' as that distance allows and blowing air at them from the same distance.
