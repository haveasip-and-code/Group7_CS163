Aberdeen
Shit Hole of a city , located right at the end of Scotland , prides itself at being the 'granite' city , its mainly coz the builders are too lazy to find anything to build buildings with other than useless depressing Granite. ; Shyte football team as well , only plays well once or twice in the whole season , against Celtic.
