existentialism
The philosophic exercise of likening oneself to God in that the direction and meaning of your life is yours alone to determine. The admission to oneself that anything and everything you know to be true may in fact be false, and that you do not possess the knowledge to determine what is and isn't. The method of continually constructing personal arguments for your decisions despite the knowledge that what you do may or may not matter.
