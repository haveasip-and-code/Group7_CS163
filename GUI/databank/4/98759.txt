The simplistic logic system of Bush supporters and other morons - apparently you have to trust him because he's President (even though 49% of the US population didn't vote for him), and anyone who criticises America is either jealous of their greatness, embittered French people who surrender all too easily, or a member of the global al-Qu'eda network.
