Ragnarok Online
A MMORPG game that takes over peoples lives. It makes (and breaks) relationships, and causes boyfriends to be glued to the internet and computer like it's their freaking feeding sack. o_O ; It is also a great game in which you can gain levels, collect assorted cute headgears, collect a multitude of other items, and obtain high levels of character power. It has a diverse community, and the graphics are extremely cute. ; Ragnarok pwnz u fkers. lolol rlh haughhhhh555!!
