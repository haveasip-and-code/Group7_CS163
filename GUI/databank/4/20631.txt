ma'amuh
In sad cases where there is an excess of situations in which one might have a mother (mama) and a baby's mother (baby' mama), this newly pronounced derivative resulted. Pronounced like 'ma'am' with the '-uh' sound at the end to distinguish it from the normal form 'mama,' 'ma'amuh' is a variant of mamuh refers to a man's baby's mother.
