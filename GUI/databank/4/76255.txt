Pocahontas
An 'exotic' looking little girl who is in love with Curious George, but courts Ralphael and keeps Malcolm on the side, just in case. She apparently cannot afford electricity because her mascara is never applied fully and just abruptly ends. She loves to wear deer-skin inspired pants with fringe and beads hanging from them. She will do whatever she can to succeed. This person should be avoided at all costs.
