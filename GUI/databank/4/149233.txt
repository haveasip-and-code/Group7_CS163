Wheaton College
1. A $41,000 per year sleep away 'highschool' consisting of wealthy and extremely spoiled [collar-poppers] who credit themselves with the 'Wheaton College Honor Code' and being intelligent, when in actuality, students know little to nothing except the latest trends. ; 2. Wealthy finishing school retreat where drugs, i.e. coke, are more important than attending class and the cutting edge 'pop' three collars.
