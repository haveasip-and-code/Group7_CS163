p101
A place infested with [p101ers], it is not a nice place to go. A sub-forum of govteen that stands for puberty 101. Often joked about amongst other members of Govteen, its inhabitants are perverted teens or pedos in search of perverted teens. ; Although most members would deny it, most that sign up at govteen started out as a [p101er] in p101 . They would have to work there way up the chain to gain respect in similar circumstances to a [prison bitch] would be to a prison. Only few surive their first few months as a p101, most are frozen or banned before gaining a 100+ smiley. Most likley cause of their ban would be from posting a picture of their '[pen0r]'. Many respectable people have come out of p101 but 60% of p101ers will always be p101ers and should be shot on site.
