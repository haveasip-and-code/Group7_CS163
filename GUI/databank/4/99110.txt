ice cream truck
A vehicle that resonates annoying, repeatitive music throughout your neighborhood for about an hour. If you're unlucky enough to live near the [projects], you even get the honor of listening to the same theme (or a slightly remixed version) resonating while you are trying to take a nap, or god forbid, sleeping after working a graveyard shift, about 3 different times a day.
