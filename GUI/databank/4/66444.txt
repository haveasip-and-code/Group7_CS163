Yak-a-black
A pejorative term for the man commonly referred to as the 'great satan of Steve's house.' Known for his lack of motivation to go out in public, he is slowly moving closer towards Dave Rogersdom and is trying to bring Steve with him. He must be stopped at all costs. It is his presence that forced the creation of the S.H.L.F. as well as its more legitimate political arm F.L.A.P.
