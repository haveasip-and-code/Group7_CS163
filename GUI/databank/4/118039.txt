ghetto horse
A dance in which one grabs one's crotch, lifts up one leg, and lifts up one arm on the same side of the leg, jumps, then switches sides, and keeps jumping while switching sides and switching the hand with which one holds one's crotch. It was invented in 2002 by a group of youngsters in St. Paul, Minnesota.
