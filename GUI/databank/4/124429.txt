more bounce to the ounce
1. Title of a Funk song composed by Roger Troutman, performed by Zapp & Roger, who were widely recognized for their use of the [vocoder]. Has been sampled by epmd, notoroious b.i.g., nas, and above the law, as well as others. ; 2. Besides the song, it means the size of a womans' breasts in relation to her overall body weight/size. A skinny, flat chested woman needs 'more bounce to the ounce,' whereas a slightly overweight woman with large breasts has enough bounce. The ideal woman would be someone with a stature similar to that of Lara Croft's (though she's fictional).
