skipping
The most under-rated form of movement in the existance of mankind. ; Skipping was invented in 1405 by Fred Skippideo in Belgium and caused widespread panic amongst the Belgium-waffles. ; Dubbed as 'elegant as a mountain goat', 'nimble as a gazzelle' and 'fast as lightning'. It's just that good! ; Even though skipping is so damn fantastic, it is often mocked and shunned for being 'girly' which is a damn lie. ; Skipping also has a macho and manly side, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and even ex-British Primemister John Major, fully endorse skipping. ; Next years London Marathon (not to be confused with the ex-chocolate bar) will not be run by Ian and Pete... it shall be skipped. ; Skipped to raise awareness for skipping. ; Skipping is under-rated and you know it.
