chatham high school
For someone who grew up in a town where you had to worry about being kidnapped, stabbed, beaten and mugged, not a bad place to grow up. ; Maybe the people are snobby, and that's wrong, but having snotty neighbors beats having neighbors that raped the little girl that moved into your old house. ; Being rich, drunk and snobby is obnoxious, but complaining about how rich drunk and snobby everyone else is and about how boring it is here is pretty obnoxious, too. ; Be thankful for what you've got and what you haven't had to put up with and worry about for the last however many years and shut the fuck up. ; Chatham is a nice place, Chatham High School is a great school (number two in the state) and the drinking, cheating and snobbery happens in any other suburban high school. A much better definition would be whiny, rich kids who don't appreciate what they've got.
