A horrible biology professor at Lafayette College. Seems to be very disgruntled at all times, most likely due to the racial profiling he experiences and his inability to board planes with out being interviewed by Feds due to his Indian or of that sort race. He is also afraid of the sun because of its cancer causing ability. Tends to yell at his students for no apparent reason, however is still nice to his research students when they are late to class/sleeping/unable to answer questions.
