Rockaway
no not that Rockaway, the Rockaway, believe it or not before the stupid song came out the beach side neighborhood of Rockaway Beach, NYC was there. One of the highest concentrated population of Irish people in the country, once call Irish Town USA, there were 102 bars in a 3 x 4 block span. It is the most radical party town you can encounter. We're there is no such time where you cant buy beer and weed is only a phone call, chirp, or yell away. The bars don't close until the beagel stores open, somtimes later, where smoking is not allowed in bars except if its smoking a joint with the bar owner, where the bartenders actually know what there doing and give buy-backs. Where you never have to hear a rap song at a bar, just good music. The summers are alive with party after party. Where the eve of every holliday seems like a reson to get wasted, you start drinking at family parties before you get out of 8th grade, where a person on the handlebars of your hampton cruiser is carpooling, and a late night skinny dip after a long night of drinking is the normal thing to do. Where fitting 9 guys into a cab is allowed. Where you can go and hang out with your 16 year old cousins at the bar with out a promblem. A cooler on the beach and a few friends can turn into a raging party. Where on a stormy day you can find most lifeguards in Rockaway at Connollys at 3 in the afternoon. Where 14 year olds are having kegs and 40 year olds are having house parties and everybody in between is drinking somwhere. Where you can ride a bike to the bar and not be the only one to do so. Where surfing is a past time and kickball is still cool. This is a college town, without the college. Where your friends have been your friends for life and will be for life.
