NC-4 Flying-Boat ; The NC-4 Flying-Boat is a US naval World War II biplane. It was introduced in 1914 as a contestant in the transatlantic race from America to England. It was the first American plane to complete a transatlantic flight, so obviously, it beat the other competitors, the NC-1 sunk and the NC-3 was badly damaged. It has floats to allow it to sail and wings to allow it to fly; this is why it is called the 'Flying-Boat'.
