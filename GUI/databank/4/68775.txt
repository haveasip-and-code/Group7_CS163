Carrboro
A Town of about 20,000 that is directly west of Chapel Hill, and about 50 times better. It is by all accounts the most liberal and free-thinking town in all of North Carolina, populated by ex-hippies, raw food vegans, UNC intellectuals, etc.... Their mayor, Mike Nelson, is openly Gay, the only such mayor I know of in N.C. The Town is centered around a a town square of sorts at Weaver St. Market, that resembles a scaled-down version of the Boston Common.
