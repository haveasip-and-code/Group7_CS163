bussel
the word within Led Zepplin's vocabulary. it has no particular meaning...but we all know it as something that is apparently in our 'hedgrow' and we are to not be alarmed by it. but that's what alarms us...the fact that it has no particular meaning...and we are supposed to not fear it. (stairway to heaven played backwards is a demonic message by the way...)
