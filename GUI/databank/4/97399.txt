conroe
A town about a thirty minite drive north of Houston,Texas with a population that consists of mostly black and hispanic people. All the white people hang out together in the subdivitions along the highway and FM1314 while the rest hang in 'Little Mexico' and downtown by the railroad tracks. It is also the county seat of Montgomery County and for some weird reason there is this arch conecting two buildings down town that reads 'Birth place of the Texas flag' that I bet a million bucks isn't true.
