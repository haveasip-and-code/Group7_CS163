Finnish tabloid magazines came up with this wonderful term, loosely translated 'a secret lover', when some airhead bimbo had sex with a well-known married finnish businessman. Later on more bimbos have gotten famous the same way and the term has become widely used. In reality it's nothing but a nicer version of the term [whore].
