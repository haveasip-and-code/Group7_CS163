bull shit
a really fun card game, u gotta place cards down in order, like Ace, 2,3 4', it doesn't matter how many u put down, as long as u get rid of ur cards, if you don't have the card(s) u need to put down, just put card(s) down and say it's the card(s) u need to put down...if someone thinks ur lying they have to say 'B.S.' or 'bullshit' if they're right, the person who lied must take the entire pile of cards, if the person who said B.S. is wrong they must take the pile. The first one to lose all their cards wins!
