The Poe Toaster
The 'Poe Toaster' is a mysterious figure that arrives at the location of Edgar Allan Poe's grave in Baltimore, every year. He or she has done this at the same time since 1949, early on the morning of his birthday, on January 19th. The 'Poe Toaster', dressed in black, with a black overcoat and scarf around their face, enters the gates of the Westminster Hall and Burying Grounds, proceeds to Poe's grave and upon reaching it, toasts the grave with a half-bottle of cognac and leaves three blood-red roses. ; Nobody has ever tried to talk to or interupt the figure that appears every year as a sign of respect both to Poe and to the 'Poe Toaster', nobody knows who he/she is, but it is commonly thought it is simply a fan of Edgar's work. The 'Poe Toaster' has often left messages behind on paper such as 'Edgar, I haven't forgotten you' and in 2001 'The New York Giants. Darkness and decay and the big blue hold dominion over all. The Baltimore Ravens. A thousand injuries they will suffer. Edgar Allan Poe evermore.'
