Frappuccino
1. An extraordinarily expensive way to mix a packet of dehydrated espresso, reconstituted powdered skim milk, and a truckload of high fructose corn syrup--blended with ice. Also known as a Fatpuccino, this drink is the polar opposite of the Atkins dietary recommendation. The Venti size also contains less caffiene than a single 'tall' cup of ordinary tea. Good eating! ; 2. Espresso, corn syrup, sort-of-milk, and le flavour all nicely done up in a little glass bottle for your higher standard's preferential consumption at your local gas station or in your grocer's fridge. The little bottles have a bit more kick than the 'official' blended version.
