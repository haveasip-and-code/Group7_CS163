Bradbury
An improbable victory attained by default; achievement only made possible by the stupidity/clumsiness/misfortune of others. ; Etymology: In the 2002 Winter Olympics men's 1000m Speed Skating final, a stumble caused the four leading men to collide in a tangle of arms, legs and blades. Australian Steven Bradbury came from behind and coasted past his fallen competitors to win his country's first ever Winter Olympics gold medal.
