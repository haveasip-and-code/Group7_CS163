elitist
A group of people, who limit themselves to people who only act and talk just like them. No one is ever good enough for them, but you can usually get somewhere for awhile by kissing all of their asses and letting them take advantage of you. Elitism, is usually related to trends since they are all the same, and anyone different is shut out of their little 'group'. Elitists like to label everyone.They are usually looked up to by younger people, because they have ''all the cool band shirts'' and piercings. In reality, it all basically just revolves around alcoholism and stds.
