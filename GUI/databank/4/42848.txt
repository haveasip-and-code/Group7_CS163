Shaeleya
Shaeleya is one of the world's most important modern painters, best known for her surrealist works. Shaeleya's work is noted for its striking combination of bizarre dreamlike images with excellent draftsmanship and painterly skills influenced by many 20th century masters. Shaeleya is an artist of great talent and imagination. Although there is very little information about her private life, she has been known to frequent the west coast. In the mid-90's art students in Northern California coined the term 'Shaeism', describing any form of art that influenced other artists or left it's thumbprint on society.
