tantra
Tantra is not well understood in the western world, but is a key to healthy living and awareness that can transform you into the person you were meant to be. ; The Sanskrit word Tantra is related to the concept of weaving and expansion- it derives from 'tan', meaning to expand, spin out, and weave. We weave the strands of our nature into a unified whole. Tantra takes the approach that one should not only not reject the body and its desires, but actually embrace them on the road to enlightenment. Tantra shares the view that sexual itercourse canbe a sacrament and a means of spiritual transformation. Tantra is the transformatin of vital energy in all its permutations ultimately toward the goal of spiritual attundement and enlightenment. In this context sexual relations become sacred.
