UDnan
A combination of two popular and equally terrible clan's names (Underworld-Dreams and Adnan) in the popular online game Asheron's Call on the Darktide server. The two for years have not officially made a peace, lest they look like Carebears (See carebear, or o.O) but have non the less insisted on Circle Jerking (See Soggy Biscuit) eachother for months. Thus earning them the derigatory term.. ; UDnan.
