cocaine
A naturally occuring stimulant that is one of the most popular of the hard drugs used nowadays. Highly addictive and often of questionable purity (due to it being cut w/ so many things by so many people), it is a dangerous drug. Still rather expensive dosage-wise but cheaper than it was in the 90s and much cheaper today than it was in the 80s. Usually a powder (not crack, that's another story) that comes in two forms--- Dull white granules (crappy stuff) or sparkly, off-white flakes (primo stuff). ; Effects--- Alot like speed, but 'cleaner' and not as long-lasting. Basically it gives a person lots of energy, makes them more alert and more sharp mentally, gives people a 'euphoria' thats difficult to explain--- it's sort of a feeling of invincibility with a simultaneous feeling that all is right in the world. Some people say that it's like ecstasy but you love yourself instead of others. Cocaine also has a pleasurable numbing effect (on gums, lips, etc). ; Unfortunately, the drug only lasts ~40 min at the most and the crash is very, very bad, with intense cravings, depression, and paranoia. Addiction soon after experimental use is not uncommon. ; Basically--- stay away from the devil's dandruff.
