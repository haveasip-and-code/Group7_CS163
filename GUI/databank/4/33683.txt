WAC
Short for Washington College, a place where public nudity is accepted and parties are in no short supply. Greek life is in constant trouble with hazing, and sports are non-existent, save for lacrosse. Drugs are casual, as is sex, the walk of shame, and an infamous reputation-expected with a college smaller than most high schools. Teachers often throw parties for the students, and there is an annual Birthday Ball where everyone gets hammered together.
