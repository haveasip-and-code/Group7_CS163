Orlando
Floridian Definition: ; The only major city in [Florida] that every [Floridian] visits, but to which no Floridian ever willfully moves. ; This arises for a couple of reasons: ; 1)Orlando is the only major city in Florida without a beach. ; 2)Floridians already see enough tourists, so Orlando is like Hell on Earth.
