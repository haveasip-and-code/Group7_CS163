communists
Like democracy, socialism, marxism, and other forms of government, a form where the ruling class claims to give power to the majority (the people, working class, whatever), while instead, devoting it to themselves. ; The concept of communism, just like the concept of democracy, would work fine if it was not corrupt, or if it did what it claimed is stood for.
