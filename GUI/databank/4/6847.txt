scirocco
A very awesome Volkswagen that could stand up to many muscle cars of its time, gifted with ahead of its time German engineering and superb handling. This is a car to great to be handled my ricers, which is why it has been kept a secret. Unfortunately, certain year models had a few common and annoying flaws which lowered the reputation of the Scirocco, But I assure you the 1981 Volkswagen Scirocco 'S' is a very excellent car made to beat 2003 Minicoopers (the red '57' model) in the SCCA and yes while still stock it can out perform the majority of ricers in this new era even though it was made more than 20 years ago.
