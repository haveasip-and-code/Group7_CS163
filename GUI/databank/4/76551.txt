gacha
A technique used in the arcade game 'Wangan Midnight: Maximum Tune' where the player will rapid shift up and down between two gears in order to somehow increase speed, and help improve their Time Attack records. This is most commonly done very rapidly, almost like how you use an eraser. ; ...Fortunately for people who don't like playing with a damaged shifter, it would seem that Namco removed this technique in version 2 of Maximum Tune, where two rapid shifts will cause shifter lock, resulting in a loss of speed. ; ...Ouch.
