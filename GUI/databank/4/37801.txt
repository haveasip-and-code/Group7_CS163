limp noodles
these group of fabulous girls at alice deal consist of: hanna, lilli, norah, sarah, and amanda. they actually didnt come up with this title for themselves and they hate it LIKE A MUG! (yes, that is language picked up from deal). they're very close and even formed a 'loverhood'. they're the hottest thing thats hit DC.
