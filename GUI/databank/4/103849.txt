Council for European Studies
Founded in 1970, the Council for European Studies is the leading American professional association for the study of Europe in the social sciences and humanities. The Council's overarching aim is to promote interdisciplinary research and study, and welcomes members across academic disciplines and beyond. Its 1,200 individual members come from the United States, Canada, twenty-four countries in Europe and some fifteen countries across the globe, and its 115 institutional members comprise a network of universities and colleges throughout North America. In light of momentous changes in Europe at the end of the twentieth century, the Council has undertaken many initiatives to act as a leader in encouraging research and interdisciplinary debate. The Council is hosted at Columbia University at the Institute for the Study of Europe and the Harriman Institute.
