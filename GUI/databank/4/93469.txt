touge
Illegal and now turned professional form of racing in Japan involving two cars chasing each other single file through a twisty course, traditionally mountain roads. If the chase car catches up by the end it wins, if the lead car pulls away it wins. Popularized in the US by the recent '[JDM] craze' and jdm option videos
