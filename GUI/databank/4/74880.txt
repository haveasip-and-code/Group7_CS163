Iran
A beautiful country in the Middle-East and is not nothing like Iraq, though a lot of people think it is a desert. ; Not a good place to drink beer or get laid by hott bitches, but definitely a nice place to own a salon and cut peoples unibrows off. ; People from Iran are often called towelheads, but they are not arab.
