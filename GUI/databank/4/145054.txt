Guito
A derogatory term for a person of Italian decent, usually those who try to be a stereotypical American-Italian. Similar to racial slurs such as nigger and cracker. ; Signs of this include but are not limited to: over-greased hair, Italian accent (even though they aren't actually from, nor have they ever been to, Italy), frequent references to the mob (even though they know no one in the mob), and using 'I'm Italian' as an excuse to be rude and/or fat.
