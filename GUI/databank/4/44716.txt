groovetational
Adjective. A word hybrid between [groovy] and 'non-confrontational', usually uttered as an expression when one slightly beyond [cool] and slightly below 'infinitely freaking spectacular' is required. ; It is worth noting that while this term is altogether suitable for colloquial and 'feigning interest' uses, it is unsuitable for sarcasm because it invariably sounds sincere. No, really.
