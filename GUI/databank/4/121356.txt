Mario
Mario was a carpenter in his days, but now he's just a pimp-ass plumber with a younger brother that often get's ignored. He is a Superstar in Mushroom Kingdom just because he saved the princess a couple of times (big deal). His brother, [Luigi], always stays watching over the home (on the other hand, who would be stupid enough to rob Mario and Luigi's hut?).
