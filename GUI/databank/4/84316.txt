Lunch Money
The most commonly-stolen item of weak public-schoolers, especially in lower-income areas where the schools do not put money on a computerized lunch account. At such a school, students have to bring in the necessary money each day to buy their meal, allowing bullies to steal money that they can actually use, as opposed to a check (is it spelled 'cheque'?).
