I Missed It!
Expression used to declare that a target, goal, or objective was not executed properly, therefore missed entirely. Usually results in some type of injury or embarrasment. Most effective if uttered quickly at the exact moment of realization that the intended objective is lost and the resulting outcome will not be good.
