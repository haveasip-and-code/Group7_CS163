Whinge Rock
Whinge Rock consists of all the bands your dad probably likes. Prime examples of whinge rock are mediocre bands such as [Nickelback], [Puddle of Mudd], [3 Doors Down], and [Three Days Grace]. Whinge rock is characterized by power chords, a singer who tries to sound tough, and being repetitive. Linkin Park, albeit whiny, is not whinge rock because the fanbase is too young, and it has more nu-metal traits than those of rock.
