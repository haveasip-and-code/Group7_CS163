Western Mass
Short for Western Massachusetts. Western Mass is, as the name implies, the western half of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is made up of four counties, Berkshire, Franklin, Hampden, and Hampshire. Often called Massachusetts' 'better half' due to the fact that it offers the same charm as the eastern half of the state, with more natural scenery and less [hussle and bussle].
