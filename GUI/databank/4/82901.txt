Hightstown
Ah, beautiful Hightstown, New Jersey, exit 8 on the NJ Turnpike and located directly in the center of this magnanimous state. Let us bathe ourselves in its diversity as though we are dipping into a warm bath on a freezing day in the dead of winter on the great mid-atlantic plain that is New Jersey. But why, you may ask? Because Hightstown is unique. Travel to some town in southern PA and try to find a mix of Latin Americans, African Americans, all kinds of white Americans, Indian Americans, and Asian Americans equal to that of glorious Hightstown. Let's love this great motley town with its antique American mainstreet and residential area at the center (what is Hightstown), the quintessential American suburb (East Windsor, let's not exclude Twin Rivers), and then a couple of farms scattered across the landscape. This is Hightstown, a place of particular normality.
