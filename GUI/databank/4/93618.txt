CTF
Stands for: Capture The Flag. ; Started as a modification for the [FPS] hit: [Quake] , in which the players were divided in to two groups and the goal was to capture the opposing team's flag and bring it back to your own team's flag while your flag is not stolen. ; This mod became popular after some time and now it is an industry standard in multiplayer games. ; Because of its complex team play requirements, [smaktard]'s brains are mostly overloaded trying to understand the logic behind it and tend to malfunction. Unable to understand the objective, they fire their own team mates committing a [TK]. ; On the best case scenario it is mistaken as a DeathMatch by [n00bs].
