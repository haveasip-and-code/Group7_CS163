Frost shock
1. A spell that deals a little over 500 frost damage and slows the target to 50% normal speed for 8 seconds; movement speed reduction is subject to diminishing returns. ; 2. A spell mostly alliance whine the heck about because they don't have as much experience with shamans as horde players do.
