And that's the whole story
When someone asked you to explain events that happened in the past you sit them down, tell them how it all began and just as it is getting interesting say '-and that's the whole story.' and pretend as if you have told them everything. It makes fun of TV shows that used this as a way to save episode time instead of repeating everything the viewers just saw.
