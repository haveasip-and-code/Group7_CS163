Steak bake
A large pasty like snack which you can currently get down Greggs on a 2 for 1 deal basis. Unfortunately due to high demand from one induvidual who goes by the name of Jack, the factory supplying the ingredients for these bakes has been thrown into turmoil, with staff shortages and the like. Jack has currently bought up most of the shop and Greggs is consequently contemplating closure for the forseeable future due to lack of items of food for sale. If and when Greggs does re-open, Jack will almost certainly be banned from going within 10 feet of the shop. The boy in question is currently on the NHS waiting list for the proceedure of stomach stapeling.
