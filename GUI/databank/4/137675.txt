The 3.0 CSL race cars were the first cars to be developed under BMW Motorsport GmbH. They were also the first to sport the newly designated official colors of BMW Motorsport - red, blue and purple - and the first to use ABS. ; The 3.0 CSL won 5 European Touring Car Championships between 1973 and 1979, as well as national championships in several countries. CSLs were so successful they continued to win races into the late 1970s even though production ended in 1975 to make way for its successor, the 6 Series. ; Thanks to the development of a four-valve cylinder head, the BMW six-cylinder engine grew from 3.2 to 3.5 liters and increased in horsepower from 340 to 430. ; In the USA, BMW of North America campaigned a 3.5 CSL team in 1975 and won IMSA races at Sebring, Laguna Seca, Riverside, Daytona and Talledega. Drivers involved in the American success of the CSLs, included Hans Stuck, Sam Posey, Brian Redman, Allan Moffat, Dieter Quester and Benny Parsons. ; The racers differed from the standard 3.0 CSL's in that they had the larger 3.2 liter engines and the distinctive spoiler. ; By 1974, BMW Motorsport was eager to homologate their only 3.5 liter engine for production-based racing. That homologation required the production of a run of larger engined road cars. The result was the fitting of their 3.2 liter (3153 cc) engine to the 3.0 CSL which increased horsepower by 6bhp (to 206bhp) and torque. ; In addition to the larger engine, Series 3 cars were often supplied with a package of aerodynamic components so dramatic that the name 'Batmobile' was soon applied. That package consisted of a very large rear wing, a more traditional rear spoiler and front fender spats. These components were very successful in competition. ; There were 167 Batmobiles built in total (including the series 3.5 cars) all of which were finished in either Polaris silver or Chamonix white.
