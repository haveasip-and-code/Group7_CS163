Buffet Effect
The act of grabbing a bunch of stuff you may never use or eat, just because you are not paying on a per-item basis. ; Notes: ; If you eat, use, or directly pay for all you take then Buffet Effect is NOT an applicable term ; If you paid over $35.00 per person [Las Vegas] and don't eat everything on your plate before getting a new plate, then it is NOT the buffet effect. This falls under 'getting your money's worth'.
