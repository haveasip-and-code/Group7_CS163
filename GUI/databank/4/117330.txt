Smelsted
A short, yet agile creature who cuddles unsuspecting victims in their sleep. This Icelandic species cannot function without clutching a Jumbo Vanilla Bean Latte at all times. The curious Smelsted refuses to wear socks with her shoes; causing a vile odour to travel into the nasal passages of those who cross her path. She may be randomly spotted driving a Mercury Topaz aiming a plastic machine gun at your face.
