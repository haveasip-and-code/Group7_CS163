IU (short form) Departments usually have an annual IU Day/Night themed on a culture or a country, so members of the club can understand foreign people more and thus brings the world closer. ; The Interact Club, on a whole is a stepping stone for teenagers to bring them into the adult world in terms of character, social stability and management capabilities.
