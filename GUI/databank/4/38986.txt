nas
The best fucking mc in the world, Jay-z is okay but Nas is the King of new york. Jay is just rapping from his pockets but Nas is spitting rhymes from is heart and mind. He came with the classic Illmaic and lots of other classic cds and mixtapes. He had beef with half of Queens bridge(his hood) mcs. And a-lot of other rappers. He has recently married the milkshake origanater, Kelis and just released another two disc clssic Street Disiples.
