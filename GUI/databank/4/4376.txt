Jiraiya
Jiraiya was a student of the [3rd hokage] and also was the sensei of the future [4th hokage]. Jiraiya is one of the Three Legendary Sennin's, with [Tsunade] and [Orochimaru]. He is the 'Rock' as the three are heavily based off the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game, or also known as Janken. ; You first see him peeping in the women bathing place to 'collect material'. [Naruto] then gave him his nickname 'Ero-sennin'. Although he is kinda stupid and funny, he truly is a master ninja. He teaches Naruto to control his 2 chakras and to summon frogs. ; As such, Jiraiya's fighting techniques are mostly defensive, His 'Underworld Swamp' immobilizes a large amount of ninja's in a marsh, and his 'Underworld Spines' defend him from any physical attack. He mostly relies on his summoning frogs to aid him, though he rarely summons [Gama Bunta]. ; There might be a good reason why he specializes in defensive techniques, and that is because he a complete and utter pervert, who writes a series of books known as [Icha Icha Paradise], a book [Kakashi] himself adores. As such, he has grown so adept at peeping he is rarely caught. ; Also see [Ero-Sennin]
