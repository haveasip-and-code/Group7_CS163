limerick
Nickname: Stab City, given to it by Dubliners. ; County in Ireland. Has an extremely bad reputation because of crime rates. You'd have to be 8 ft tall and 22stone armed with knives and guns to walk around the Southill area after 9.00pm. ; Don't leave your car outside your back at ANY hour in the Southill area, as it will surely be stolen. ; But is Limerick the worst place to live in Ireland? I DON'T think so. ; Why? Because, besides the MANY, many SCUM that live there it's also filled with friendly, up for a laugh people, who could drink you under the table and bring you to the best house party ever. End of!
