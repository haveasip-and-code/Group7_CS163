Mater Dei
A school in Santa Ana, California that is ridiculously good at sports. IT also provides a great education to those that want it. Also unlike that gay school called Sage Hill it does not cost 19 grand a year and there are not as many stuck up bitches that get escalades and porsches for their first cars.
