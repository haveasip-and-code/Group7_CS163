Her Evil Royalty
When the Finnish Love Metal band HIM wanted to realease a CD in North America they were told that they had to rename their band because Him was already a cpyrighted band name. ; They renamed their band HER for a rare realease of Razorblade Romance, and HER jokingly stands for HER EVIL ROYALTY to comabt HIM's HIS INFERNAL MAJESTY. ; They are now able to realease and tour under the name HIM as the prior band is obsolete.
