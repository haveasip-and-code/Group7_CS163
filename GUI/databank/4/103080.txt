Moby is a talented musician who helped make electronica what it is today. ; Neverthelesss, other artists/groups such as Orbital, Underworld, Kraftwerk, the Prodigy, the Chemical Brothers, Daft Punk, DJ Shadow/U.N.K.L.E. ,Aphex Twin ,Crystal Method, heck even Fatboy Slim and i'm sure i'm forgetting more groups etc. have had more impact on electronica music overall, than Moby has. ; Moby's music definitely soared in popularity with he album Play. The album Play however, was just freeriding off the popularity of other albums that came out earlier such as: Chemical Brothers' Dig You Own Hole and Prodigy's Fat of the Land, and Daft Punk' Homework. It was these earlier albums that had the tough job of cracking the North American market for electronica, so they set it up for an American act such as Moby to be more successful. ; But if you have been listening to electronica/rave/techno before it exploded in 1997 you would've have recognized the pioneering albums such as Prodigy's Music for the Jilted Generation and Experience , Chemical Brother's Exit Planet Dust, Orbital's self titled Orbital and Orbital2, Kraftwerk's Computer World etc. ; That is not to say Moby wasn't making music before electronica was big in North America. It's just that he didn't make a big impact then. Most people just knew the single 'Go'. ; For some reason, to me it seems that people in America credit Moby mostly because he's American and he's got some opinion about everything. He's more in the public eye. Or perhaps, maybe they give him patronage because Eminem picks on him and we feel sorry for him. ; Whatever the reason, the above mentioned artists (are more influential musically and internationally.)
