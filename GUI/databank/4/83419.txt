NEP
Acronym for 'new economic policy.' Introduced by Lenin in 1921 as an attempt to save an economy ravaged by the civil war. The NEP was a form of 'capitalism light' in which the government maintained control over large industries, but private wages and trading on a small scale were allowed. In many ways the NEP was an insult to the communistic ideals of the revolution and was extremely controversial.
