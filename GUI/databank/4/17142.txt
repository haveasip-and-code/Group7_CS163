DUDE BRO
White suburban male, usually 16-25 years of age, hailing mostly from Orange County, CA and surrounding areas. Characterized by their love for rolling around in lifted (extreme) trucks and their over use of bandanas, black socks with shorts, spikey hair, belts with queer designs and belt buckels, SPY sunglasses, and trucker hats. Favorite bands include Kottonmouth Kings and Kingspade. The most annoying members of the dude bro family are from the 951 and 909 area codes of the Inland Empire of Southern California... but more toned down (and slightly more queer) versions can be found in Orange County (714). Favorite drinks include Budweiser and Bud Light. Catch phrases include: 'DUUUUDE!!' and 'Bra (Bro).' Dude Bro's seldom roam alone and can usually be found in packs of 5-10 people. Favorite sports include riding dirtbikes and monster truck rallys. Dude bros display a complete lack of originality and can quickly get on one's nerves.
