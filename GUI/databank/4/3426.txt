friends
Friends are those who are continously there for support when it is needed... ones that will even though dislike you significant, will sit there and talk to them juss for the sake of pleasing you and making you happy due to seeing them both in the same room... also people that will drive across the island after a long day of work cause you called them crying hysterically cause you found out your other half was cheating... and also the ones that will no matter what they've told you in the past about you current and you didnt believe they will never say I TOLD YOU SO when you find out, although its itching to come out... the ones that will take the blame that you needed to put on sum one beside yourself and your half, for you depression and suicidal modes that you tend to go through... basically friends are juss a phone call away, and are more like family...
