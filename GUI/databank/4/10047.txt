Death Cab for Cutie
A band of non-talents,a group of middle-class well-off kids, one of which I knew in high school ( NICK HARMER ) ROGERS HIGH in PUYALLUP... who find imperfections in there life and create a ridiculous, depressing melodrama around each one. Alternative rock on estrogen, wallowing in their imaginary quagmire of torment. Listening to this genre' of music is not recomended, as it clearly gets its influence from the gimlet-eyed quintet of queers shown on Bravo... ( Queer eye for the straight guy )take warning, as this form of music needs to be banned, as it is a direct cause of todays metrosexual pandemic.
