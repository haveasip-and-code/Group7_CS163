Subpoena [latin]
A Subpoena actually or correctly is an order of a court which requires a person to be present at a certain time and place or suffer a penalty (subpoena means, literally, 'under penalty'). This is the tool used by Court to ensure that witnesses present themselves at a given place, date and time to make themselves available to testify.
