Tetraform
A moderate internet gamer who is a pain to go up against in cyber combat. Usually found in Counter-Strike and in Jedi Knight 2:Jedi Outcast, but can pop up in any other games. ; His name means '4 forms'. It stems from the to words 'tetra' meaning 4 and 'form'. Why he chooses to name himself this way noone knows, but it might have something to do with his unpreditable nature. Perhaps he is insane and has multiple personality disorder. ; His name has such a flow to it that a clan formed so that it could be seen more often. And also because in CS he is a knife freak.
