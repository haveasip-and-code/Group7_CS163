Kory Fleischmann
He couldn't spell any words correctly to save his life, despite how he corrects every bodies grammar, muscle bound fool, loves jumping jeeps over other cars,, and loves obsessive church going bible hugging women, breaks doors and chairs and punches signs while smearing blood everywhere, all he can get are Christian bible huggers, while disliked by the non-Christian society, the perfect definition of a bully, picks on the football team, has a subliminal joy of bringing pain and getting in trouble, he thinks he is a big tough bad-ass but loves watching movies on Life-Time.
