*BRICK*
Internet terminology. This is used when someone says something purposely stupid, perverted, or sounds like they have said something serious but were joking. It is usually referenced as a large brick thrown at the person who has spoken. Different variations include *BRICKHOUSE* all the way to *UNIVERSE* as whatever mentioned steadily becomes more perverted or even stupdier.
