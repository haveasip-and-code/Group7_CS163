you forgot poland
A stupid joke started by Kerry supporters. ; During a debate Kerry said that the U.S only has support from Australia an the U.K in Iraq, and Bush pointed out 'you forgot Poland'. I don't see what is so funny. Poland coomands around 9,500 troops in Iraq (2,400 of which are Polish). Whoever said that poland only contributed 'a few non-combat troops' is wrong. Also, I think the joke is on Kerry, since how could he not recognize Poland as an ally in Iraq?
