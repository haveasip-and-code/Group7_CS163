Urban Pictionary
1. Any UrbanDictionary.com definition with an unnecessary and redundant amount of images posted under it. The pictures aren't posted to provide a visual example of the word being defined like other definitions, but rather just so [attention whore]s can post pictures of themselves, their pets, or post (sometimes) funny image macros. ; 2. Any Urbandictionary entry with at least 18 images, and/or where the images posted all represent the exact same thing.
