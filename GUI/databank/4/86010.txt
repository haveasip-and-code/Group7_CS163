Galaxy Angel
Only the best anime there is! It's funny as hell, and even has [Milfeulle]! I'm just curious. If not, have any of you heard of it before now? It's actually pretty good, funny too. It's about these five girls that make up an elite force called 'Angel Brigade.' They are trying to find a thing called, 'Lost technology,' the thing is, nobody really knows what the 'lost technology' is. There's a lot more to it, but that's just a small summary.
