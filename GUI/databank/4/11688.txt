Connecticut
Maybe by statistics one of the richest states, but has a very large ghetto population. either you in a farm community, which is the richer section, or you in a city...which is most likely ghetto. ive never been to a city in ct that didnt atleast have one area wit moderatly high crime. some of the many ghettos: hartford, new haven, bridgeport, stamford, middletown, east hartford, and there is a farming town, portland, who has a lot of poverty, ghettos, and white trash. Also home to many italians and puerto ricans.
