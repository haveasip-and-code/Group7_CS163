old west
term used when refering to an extreme form of revenge. Like what the main character does in most westerns. The person this is said to is always someone who is ignoble and ussually done something to a woman to bring on the punishment. if you say this you better make him wish he was rather receiving a Pelican Bay style [donkey punch] from bubba the 300 lbs black man for a year straight then face what you've done. ; also said ol'west
