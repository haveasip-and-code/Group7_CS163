sunflower supernova
A kalidescope-like image, bursting with color and light. Many variations exist, with no defined image. Usually seen while very stoned/tripping off of weed, shrooms, etc. Usually in motion, sumflower supernovas are very interesting and unique patterns. I recommend smoking large amounts of drugs to induce images.
