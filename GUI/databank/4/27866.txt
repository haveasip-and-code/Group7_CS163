stroker
An internal combustion engine that has been modified to increase displacement by replacing the stock crankshaft with a crankshaft that has more throw. This increased throw necessitates modified pistons and usually new rods. The increase in displacement resulting from stroking an engine will almost always result in an engine that produces more torque (and HP) than the stock engine.
