Boob on the hooter
Uttered by musically gifted English crackhead, Pete Doherty, after hearing a nasty comment Morrisey made about him. Meaning is unclear, but linguists believe despite the sexual connotations, most people on the recieving end of such 'boobing' are 50 year old virgins. Staple threat on The Strokes' internet message board.
