Burning Sands
Burning Sands is an amorphus burning mass, that careers hither, and thither, with complete and utter disregard for any and all authority. Several drunken youths are held responsable for it. It only occurs in december, and forces them to drink to excess and engage in drunken deborchery on Rings Beach, near Mararangi, North Island, New Zealand.
