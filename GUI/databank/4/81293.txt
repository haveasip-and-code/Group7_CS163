Al Kazeer cryptic
A fat joint made with hash in which seperate chunks of hash are wrapped with cloth pipe cleaners, then all the pipe cleaners are rolled into a big pipe-cleaner joint. To smoke, you unwravel an individual tendril of hash and [freehand] it. Called 'cryptic' because of the unwinding process.
