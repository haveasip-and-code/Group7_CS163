IGN
<< Not an endorsement or advertisement. >> IGN is one of the more popular mainstream online sources for the latest news on video games. IGN has recently expanded to include film information, including movie reviews, as well. Is very unpopular with the more niche gamer for their overt catering to mainstream tastes and interests. IGN is largely characterized by its poorly written reviews and haphazard game ratings. Known for giving inflated review scores to very popular or hyped games in order to drive sales for their advertisers and corporate sponsers.
