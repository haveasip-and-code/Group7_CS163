Fried gold
Again,invented by Nick Frost and popularized by the movie Shaun of the Dead. However, I believe the intended meaning stems not from something being hot enough to fry gold, but rather a combination of the appreciations for things made of gold, and fried foods; as if the only way gold could be any more valuable is if it were battered and deep fried. (Mmmmmmm, fried gold..) This also seems very befitting of Nick Frost's character.
