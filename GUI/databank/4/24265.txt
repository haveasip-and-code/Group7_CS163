cacelorazo
A mode of protest made famous during the [Argentinazo] in late 2001. It involves protesters making noise by banging pots, pans and other utensils (originally to symbolise hunger). It can be used either to disrupt through making a noise, or simply to draw attention. Since the Argentinazo, it has become popular across Latin America and beyond, and has been used by European anti-capitalists among others. ; A similar protest tactic in India is known by the name [gherao].
