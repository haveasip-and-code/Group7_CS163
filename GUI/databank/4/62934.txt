doylestown
doylestown is an amazing place that gay people like kiki are jealous cuz they dont live there..yes it is true most of us are getting drunk and a drug dealer with his backpack of herb can be found on almost every corner..as well as the local kids getting kicked off the sidewalk because their [loitering] when really their [straight edge] kids that are not as badass as the [fuzz] think..and yes i do chill in town almost every nite..town is my life and kiki should just be shot.
