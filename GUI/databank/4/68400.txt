lick the weed
When you and your friends are trying to load another bowl, but someone you are with drops some of it and you are already too stoned to pick it, so whoever spilt it must then lap up all of the fallen off of the counter top or whatever surface it may have landed upon; meanwhile everyone else must chant 'LICK-THE-WEED!' in unison until all the weed has been licked.
