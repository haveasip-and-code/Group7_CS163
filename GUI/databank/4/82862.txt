greenville
This small (but growing) town is pretty much the only sign of civilization between Raleigh and the OBX. Greenville, NC is located about 45 minutes east of I-95 and about an hour west of the OBX. Located in Pitt County (the poorest county in the state) Greenville has 3 different types of people: rednecks, poor black families, and college students. In the heart of G-Vegas is East Carolina University, a large univeristy known more for their parties and beautiful women than their academics. Greenville is about 90% black with the other 10% consisting of students and utter rednecks. There are a few good spots in town, but the majority of it is ghetto. For a good time check out Mesh Cafe or hit up an ECU tailgate prior to a football game. Also make sure to check out the homes of BMX bikers Dave Mirra and Ryan Nyquist. ; By the way, for a small town the traffic is complete hell. When driving on Greenville Blvd. it'll take you a half hour to get from campus to Target (a total of 6 miles away). Also, watch out for insane drivers. People in Greenville will drive under the speed limit, come to a complete stop in order to make a turn, make left turns from the left lane (and not the center turn lane), but they'll speed through parking lots like it's NASCAR.
