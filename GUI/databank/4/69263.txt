taxachusetts
A term used to describe Massachusetts. Although not the highest taxing state for income taxes, certainly one of the leading states in taxing everything within the boundaries of the state. ; Mass is a miserable place full of liberals the closer you get to the coast. ; Problem is, people there don't even realize it. You have to leave the state to have full comprehension of the problem. ; The East coast version of California...another collection of leftist idiots.
