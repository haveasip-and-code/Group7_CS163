F.L.A.P.
'The Freedom Loving Alcoholics Party.' The political arm of the more militant right-wing group S.H.L.F. F.L.A.P. is committed to the creation of an intellectual consensus against sitting inside all weekend and never going out. Less concerned with Steve's house per se, F.L.A.P. is opposed to a more global problem: being a douche bag and not going out on the weekend.
