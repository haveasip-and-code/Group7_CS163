morristown
A town in new jersey that is becoming increasingly ghetto, where the preppy kids are embarassed to say that they go to the high school. A place where spanish people dominate the inner town and stay outside till all hours of the night. Morristown is in the heart of the 3rd richest county in America, as of 2005. The suburbs including: Morris Plains, Convent Station and Morristownship all have wealthy cores, but still support a common trash highschool.
