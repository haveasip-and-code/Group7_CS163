Piracy
The downloading or copying one a copyrighted item. Piracy is achieved through the use of P2P programs, such as Kazaa, Direct Connect, WinMX, BitTorrent, or etc. However, there are a few websites that legitimately offers pirated items. ; Through piracy, everything short of nourishment and clothing can be achieved. You can pirate books, music, video games, movies, or software. However, there are a series of argument pertaining to piracy. Such arguments are: ; 1) Industries - Those bastards are stealing money from us. If we could stop piracy, prices would go down enormously and there would be more jobs due to more demand! ; 2) Pirates - If we couldn't pirate, we wouldn't buy your overpriced crap anyway! Who the hell is gonna pay $600+ for Photoshop or $200+ for new Windows OS? And 'there will be more jobs', my ass! You'll most likely outsource jobs to India for more profit! ; 3) Litigious Jerk Offs - We'll have those pirating bastards on their knees in no time, but first, we have to find out the age of those we sue! Those goddamn idiotic American people gets all giddy eye every time we sue a little boy for downloading 50 Cent. If we don't, he's going to grow up to be a serial killer! ; Basically, the argument boils down to the industries wanting more profit, pirates wanting to spend less, and litigious jerk offs wanting to make more money by suing everyone. So far, the industries are still making enormous profit because the vast majority of people don't know how to pirate. The pirates are still pirating because piracy is virtually impossible to stop. And the jerk offs had been blasted for suing several wrong people, but they managed to scare a lot of people off of Kazaa.
