dulaney
a center of apparent learning where kids from j-ville can afford all the weed they want, sex in the bathrooms is a common event, where you get in more trouble for wearing a cut low shirt then for smoking, prep kids are more ghetto then boys in baby blue 'shorts' and beaters, and teachers are 10% genuine, 30% crack addicts, 40% molesters, 20% mentally incapable. All of these endearing traits make Druglaney one of the best schools in the state, known mainly for the drinking team that has a lacrosse problem.
