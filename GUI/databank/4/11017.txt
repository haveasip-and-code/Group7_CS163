Trapeezytratasons
Perhaps when you get wrecked by smoking canibis and downing a few bottles of bud, you tend to talk [gibberish]. If you just get wrecked on Weed, then you talk 'Trapeezytratasons'. If you don't smoke weed, you don't really know it exists but if you do, say it lots and you'll love it. ; Often the language spoken by a new bonger.
