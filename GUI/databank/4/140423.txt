Why do you hate America so much?
A rhetorical question, asked in an [ironic] sense, derived from a supposed conservative tendency to view disagreement as unpatriotic. It is chiefly used in two situations: when a non-conservative points out something damning to the orthodoxy, and when a conservative says soemthing that reveals hypocrisy.
