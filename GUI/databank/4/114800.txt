abnormal
Psychology defines abnormal typically in the realms of abnormal behavior. There are three main criteria that are used in defining what is abnormal. ; They are: ; 1. The behvaior poses a risk to either themself/others. ; 2. The person exhibiting the behavior is distressed by it. ; 3. It is statisically deviant. ; Also, to a lesser extent, societal norms come into play in defining what is abnormal, but the risk of using this as a criterion increases the risk of stigmatizing.
