casual gamer
A casual gamer is somebody who doesn't know jack shit about video games. ; Their 'game' collection often consists mainly of annually rehashed sports titles with buggy engines and unbalanced gameplay as well as other EA garbage. Many casual gamers refuse to play [Nintendo] games because they're too 'hardcore' to play that 'kiddy crap,' yet they're the type of cowards who'll give up on games like [Ninja Gaiden], because 'it's [too hard].' ; Other popular games among casuals are: [Grand Theft Auto], a pointless game that appeals to the type of idiot who thinks shooting a hooker is as funny the thousandth time as the first; [Gran Turismo], because driving around in circles is the most rewarding gameplay experience ever; and [Tomb Raider], because shitty games can sell well just like shitty music if they have enough 'sex appeal.'
