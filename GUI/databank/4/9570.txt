didcot
Possibly planet earths crappiest town in the history of the world. Whoever believes Didcot is anything BUT a pile of penguin poo deserves to be thrown in the middle of a giant man-eating penguin mosh-pit and unable to manoever at all until he is crushed or eaten to DEATH!! However, Didcot will not be this for much longer on account of the fact that loads of decent shops are being built, which means I won't have to go to Oxford or Reading, just to buy a half-decent PAIR OF SOCKS! Didcot will be O.K and better than Abingdon, HA HA GUTTED YOU MISERABLE, HOMOSEXUAL ABINGDON..ISH SPACKOS!!!!!!!!!
