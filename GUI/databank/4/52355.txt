clozapine
Clozapine is a sever anti-psychotic usually used to treat schizophrenia. What's notable about it is its most common side affect, the destruction of white blood cells. Patients that take clozapine sometimes have their white blood cells decreased rapidly right after taking the medication. Due to this fact, every time a person needs to get a supply, they need to complete a white blood cell test.
