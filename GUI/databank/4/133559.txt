WINKY
An cute emoticon featured on some php forums that looks like the typical smiling round happy face (ie. Wal-Mart), but the way he is drawn, he looks like he is half-smiling and half-winking both at the same time, almost as if to say 'Got'Ya' or 'I know I'm right'. I really should put his picture on here if only I knew how right now.
