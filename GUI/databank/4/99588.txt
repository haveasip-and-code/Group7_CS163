The Blues Brothers
Greast musical ever created. Stars John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, and also has a slew of guest stars: Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and ray charles are just a few. This movie depicts two brothers, Jake and elwood, trying to raise enough money for an orphanage to stay up and running by reuniting an old blues band. The brothers Run into the law, Nazis, and disgruntled Country Singers. These two will stop at nothing to accomplish their task, after all 'they're on a mission from God'.
