Bear Colton
The littlest of the Colton's (though not the shortest). A little annoying sometimes but also entertaining as well (not in that way...I don't go that way u sick minded freak) Anyway, takes boats from lakes with family members help. Hangs out in his room alot. Not really sure what goes on in there...
