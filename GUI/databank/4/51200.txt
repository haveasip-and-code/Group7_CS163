Tim Canterbury
A character of BBC's The Office who just turned 30, lives with his parents, and works in Slough at Wernham-Hogg paper company. Pretty much the only high points in this life of his include pulling practical with engaged receptionist Dawn (OTP!) on his annoying desk neighbour Gareth Keenan.
