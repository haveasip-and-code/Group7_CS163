bethos
The inevitable outburst of common sense and brutal honesty that results when intelligence has been pushed beyond tolerence by wholly gratuitous stupidity. A variation of going [postal] or [flaming], except through verbal or text medium and without actual violence. The primary quality is the forthright and unvarnished presentation of reality to the offending party, with the intent to educate as well as excoriate.
