Mosin-Nagant Sniper
A [Mosin-Nagant] 91/30 configured for sniper use. Earlier models come with the PE scope, and later models the PU (the scope seen in Enemy at the Gates and Call of Duty). ; Nowadays, these are hard to come by. Even if you do find one, they are about $400-$500+, which is 5-10 times more than a standard Mosin-Nagant.
