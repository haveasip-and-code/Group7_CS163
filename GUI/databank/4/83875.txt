drop-thru
(longboard skateboarding) ; a hole that closely fits the baseplate of a truck is cut through the deck, the baseplate the truck is removed from the hanger, then both are reattached with the deck between. the bolts are used upside-down for this. ; trucks are dropped to lower the riding surface for stability in speedboarding and sliding, and to give a more comfortable push for cruising. the closer the deck surface is to the ground, the less the distance one must step down to push is. ; also, the dropped deck will cradle more than tip than a conventional or risered one. this causes a dropped deck poorer geometry for traction because it centers the rider's weight toward the wheels outside of a turn and gives a strange feeling while carving. ; if the riding surface is below the axle, the board is probably TOO low.
