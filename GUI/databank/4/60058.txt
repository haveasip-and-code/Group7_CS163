Temporal Paradox
1: When the very flow of time colapses upon in itself due to a temporal incursion or 'Time Travel' Noteworthy people who have gone backward in time would be...Well, that guy in Timecop....Shut up. ; Anyhoo, don't go back in time, because you'll only crush a mosquito and destroy Berlin. ; For more information on time paradoxes, Play TimeSplitters: Future Perfect. or watch a ST: Voyager episodes when it goes back in time...They have it down. ; 2. Whatever went on with Red Foreman and that big ship in Star Trek: Voyager. Like, seriously, WTF? Temporal Shielding? And why could they live forever if they're protected from time. They'd age normally! Sorry, it's just the fact you could erase places from time looks cool, but is just not feasible.
