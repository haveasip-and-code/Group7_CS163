paper pimp
Paper pimp (n). A high profile left or right wing columnist, who writes op ed pieces with a particular slant to persuade many of its readers to buy a newspaper, that otherwise would be used for the litterbox or the bird cage lining. A paper pimp knows his/her audience, so it will sell in certain markets. Paper Pimps are found syndicated in many of the large metropolitan 'rags' throughout the country. This can also be used as a descriptive: 'paper pimper, or pimping papers'.
