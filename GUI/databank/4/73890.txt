belfast
Belfast , city full of wonders!! beautiful archtecture such as the Antrim Road police station! Beautiful wall paintings depicting masked men with AK-47s Low crime rate , home of George Best the Titanic and the Ulster Fry. Well nuff of that bullshit... Its basically a crap city with decent shops wall paintings and massive fucking police stations. The police cars r well cool tho , armoured land rovers , they fuckin kick ass! (Apart from the fact they now look like ice cream vans and are full of police officers of corse!) Can be good craic here although ethnic minorities are treated as outcasts. Full of spides and millys , easily spotted by big earings fake burberry and crappy tracksuits. Home of many football clubs and Ulster Rugby. Linfield and Glentoran (the two main football teams) are VERY loyalist , Ulster Rugby is mixed and trys yo promote cross community activities
