belarus
The one country in Europe no one seems to have ever heard of. Fewer people know Belarus than Luxembourg. The country is considered part of the 'Axis of Evil' since it sells Russian weapons so pretty anyone who is willing to pay. ; Belarusian girls are very hot especially from Minsk. They are very smart and love to have fun (they will kill you in beer-pong). ; Belarus has a good rowing team as well as a good hockey team .
