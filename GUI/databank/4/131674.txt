Crime Mob
A crunk group that became famous with their hit single 'Knuck If You Buck.' But since then they have fell off and rumors are speculating that the two females of the group are making their own CD. Which will do worse than the fist one. When their song comes on someone always seems to get into a fight and the party gets shut down.
