Cunt
1) vulva/vagina ; Almost certainly a proper technical term for the female organ(s) - consider the number of similar-sounding terms in both Latin and Germanic languages. Became a taboo word simply because it related to both sex and femininity - but many prefer it, finding that other everyday terms like 'pussy' just don't have the right sound. ; 2) stupid/contemptible person of either gender ; Only in America is this considered a specifically misogynistic insult. In Britain it is most likely to be heard amongst men quarelling.
