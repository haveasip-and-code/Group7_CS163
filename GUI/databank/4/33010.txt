torrent
further to current definition, it should be noted that over the past 12 months or so, there has been a surge in torrent sites offering 'free downloads' but where you have to pay a monthly fee to join. Some of these sites claim to be anonymous (bullsh*t by the way). ; All these sites are simply mirrors of freely-available sites, carrying links to .torrent files for use with BitTorrent. The pay-to-join sites mostly don't even host any .torrent files themselves (that's how they get around the law) and this, in turn, means if you are actually stupid enough to shell out for any of these sites, you have lower intelligence than the average boiled sprout. Go shoot yourself in the gut, right now, to ensure you can't produce any spawn stupider than yourself.
