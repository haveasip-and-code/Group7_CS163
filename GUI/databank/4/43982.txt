chunjs
A purposeful mispelling of the word '[chunks]'. ; In the MMORPG Aspereta, the player Xain made a typo once and accidentally said, 'I 'm so fat, I have chunjs on my legs' instead of 'I'm so fat, I have chunks on my legs'. He began to use 'chunjs' instead of 'chunks', and soon the entire game was saying it even though they didn't know where it came from.
