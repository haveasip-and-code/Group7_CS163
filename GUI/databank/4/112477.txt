widiot
George W Bush. Walker the Idiot = WIDIOT. Thats the most popular reference to the word widiot. But even before Walker started proving himself as the Idiot, in 1998, a techie from India with a name starting with 'W' found that about himself. Frustrated by not being able to create a good username for himself, he ended up creating widiot on yahoo. He called himself W****, The Idiot. Apart from the above Widiot has been used as nick names by hackers and gamers. Also, in a few circles, the word moron is replaced by 'widiot'. A slightly close reference is 'WIDOT' wich stands for 'Wisconsin Department of Transport'. Mainly, Widiot stands for W_______ the Idiot. and the most popular Widiot is George W Bush.
