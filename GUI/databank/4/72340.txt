Albert Einstein
Most famous physicist of the 20th century. His publications in 1905 are regarded as the beginning of a new era in physics. He made discoveries on Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, special relativity, and energy equivalence. In his paper 'Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?' published in late 1905, he propesed the equation E=mcc, his most famous equation. This equation says that an object at rest posseses energy. Therefore that mass is energy. What most people don't know is that Einstein did not discover this equation, Olinto de Pretto, a little know Italian physicist published the equation in 1903. Although it is possible that Einstein did not know about de Pretto's publications many historians believe that Einstein did have knowledge of de Pretto's dicoveries and did not acknowledge them in his publications.
