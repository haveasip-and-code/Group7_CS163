Indi-Fuckin-Ana
A nickname given to my brother's new found homeland. Having seen Pretty Woman probably too many times, my Mom and I just coudldn't utter the word Indiana without the 'fuckin' in the middle. It's from a classic line in Pretty Woman. For those of you not familiar:(This is Para-Phrased) ; Vivian: 'Who does that work out for?' ; Kit: 'What, like you want a name?' ; Vivian: 'Yeah Gimme one name' ; Kit: 'A name, a name. The pressure of a name.' ; PAUSE ; Kit: 'Cinde-Fuckin-Rella'
