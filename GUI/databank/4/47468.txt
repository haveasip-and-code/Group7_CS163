space bat
1) Something very crazy or wacky. Usually a noun, such as a person. A space bat is so whacked out you might think they are in space. That combined with being crazy (or 'batty') is significant and worthy of having its own word. Hence Space Bat. ; 2) A bat found in space. Space Bat's have an armoured body and can fire energy weapons from their faces. These types should be avoided at all costs as they are very scary and almost impossible to destroy with any weapons.
