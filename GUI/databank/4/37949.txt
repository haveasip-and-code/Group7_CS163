temecula
A city with a lot of nothing to do in southern california... people smoke weed a lot and theres a lot of 12 year old emo kids with their hair in their eyes with really bad acne... then theres the bros with their hoes and their lame companies that they advertise on the lifted truck their dad with the small penis bought them. Then theres the overcrowded high schools rampant with teen sex, drugs, and violence... typical wholesome america.
