Duck Hunt
A great game for the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) that was revolutionary in a gun games. ; The first gun game ever for home consoles, the player would shoot down ducks as your dog would capture what you killed. ; The game featured one duck (easy mode) and two ducks (hard mode) and as the player progressed to the next level, the ducks would get faster and harder to hit. ; Their was also a clay shooting game for those who didn't like killing ducks, lol. But that wasn't as popular. ; Their have been rumours that their is an ending to Duck Hunt, but as far as I am concerned, their is no end. You can be on level 1,000,000 and keep going. But maybe their is an ending, who knows?
