Fobulous
When your FOBULOUS that means that you have far surpassed the normal limits of what a FOB is, although you are still well liked. You see being FOBULOUS is a compliment. Hell if your gonna be a fob you might as well try to fully BE YOUR INNER FOB to the max. When your a FOBULOUS, You are now such a fob that simply stating you are a FOB isnt enough. Your eat, breath, and sleep FOB. You are THE FOB of all FOBS. Your FOBULOUS son!
