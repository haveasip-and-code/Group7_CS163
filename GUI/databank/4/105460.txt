wrestle
A SPORT, people say it's gay, ok then, why do all the wrestlers have hot chicks on their arms? If you don't wrestle because you think 'ew it's gay' it either: ; 1. your not confident about your sexuality. ; 2. you are dumb. ; 3. you know you'll get trashed in a ring. ; I myself wrestle, and a lot of other sportsmen come in and TRY, but a lot don't succeed because it's a very tough sport and you have to be superfit and your body is not suited to wrestle. Their are many different styles: ; 1. Pro: American style wrestling done by big muscly guys ; 2. Shoot: real, such as Ultimate Fighting Championships ; 3. British: Submission based, sort of like American but originated from the UK and has a different more traditional image to it ; 4. Indy: RoH, LAW, very good style of wrestling, like backyarding rules but in a ring and professional ; 5. Amatuer: Olympic style wrestling ; 6. Backyarding: I don't know how any can call with wrestling but somehow it's classed as wrestling, done by risktakers in their backyards who record it on home video, I would classify it as 'brawls' personally ; 7. Lucha Libre: originated from mexico, traditionally wear masks, do highflying moves ; Their are more but I'm tired... ; Yeah I agree wrestling can sometime be boring to watch, but remember wrestler's are awsome athletes who go out their every night and day and kick ass for you guys at home. ; It's not all fake, moves are 50-50, both people make the moves happen, but risks and injuries are real and so are the stunts, respect wrestler's whether you like them or not.
