mizzou
Missouri University. mizzou sports is one of the things that everyone in columbia obsesses over (along with the cities of St Louis and KC (not the NFL teams, but the cities themselves because they are so 'hard,' and 'gangsta')). over half of the people at hickman wear mizzou clothing on a daily basis, which i find very sad.
