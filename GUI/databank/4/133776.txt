Full Metal alchemist
-An excellent colorful anime full of comedy, drama, fantasy, and yes, even metal :P. I was somewhat apprehensive because of the overall apearance of the show at first (you know, big googly eyes, and manga-ish reactions) but I was pleased to see that they did this just to draw in the more immature crowd who like bright and shiney objects, etc,. The overall plot just keeps on getting thicker and thicker, with new twists and turns that is not often found nowadays in anime. ; -The only thing that I can think of that is 'wrong' with the show is that it has bad comedic timing, like if someone coughs blood, it gives them a split-second, almost comic-like look to them (this actually does happen). ; -Though it is still not my favorite anime, it is surely making its way up my list (cowboy bebop being at the top, of course). It has a great storyline, tear-jerking scenes, (both comedic and tragic)and excellent character-development, the thing that I look for the most to define a good series. ; I give this series an A-. Good job Ed and Al! ; Just a small author's note: I am not what you would call a typical anime fan (though some of you may say that there is no such thing as a 'typical' anime fan, you're just the kind of people I'm talking about). To give you a visual: I am 17-years-old, blonde, straight, normal/somewhat pretty, 125lb girl, who never wears rainbow stockings, OR freaky cat ears, is not in the 'goth' group, or any other punk-emo whatever group....and uh...did I forget any other stereotypes, hmmm...oh well it'll come to me later. Anyhoo, I just wanted to say that so you know that you guys are not hearing from the same people over and over again. ; Oh. Yea. Watch the show.
