A very talented musician. Uses lots of spanish and random sound effects. My favorite song, E-Pro. My second favorite, Where It's At. Also the mysterious song 'Girl' which nobody knows the real refrain lyrics to. In the liner notes it says 'Hey my ... girl' Thanks a lot Beck. People think that it could be: sun-eyed, summer, cyanide, cyan eyed, sinner, etc. I think it's cyan eyed or cyanide. ; Odelay and Guero are great albums.
