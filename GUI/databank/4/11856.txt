Ion Cannon
Not much is known about it's origin at this time, but the Ion Cannon (AKA Godsend) is a destructive, electricity-based weapon fired from satellites orbiting the Earth. It can be activated by either direct control from an advanced Communications center, or it can be controlled by a commando on the ground, using what is known as an 'Ion Cannon Beacon', which is a small piece of high-tech machinery that sends out a signal to the satellite once it has been placed and activated, essentially acting like the laser sight on a rifle. It is not advised to stick around once an ion cannon beacon has been placed, unless you are a NOD engineer, at which point you simply dis-arm the blasted thing. ; Similar to the NOD [Nuclear Missile]
