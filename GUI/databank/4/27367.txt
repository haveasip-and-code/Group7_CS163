pudgeworth
A Pudgeworth is a bloated, fat relative of the species Homo Sapiens. They can be identified by having more chins than a Chinese phone book, more rolls than a bakery and being somewhat short. They are often found eating, sometimes dumpster scraps if no other food is available. They usually claim to work at a location known as 'Mungry Jacks' although no such business has ever been found and this is considered to be a slang term for stuff my face with mud cake. Pudgeworths are prone to bouts of anger if called Pudgeworth or fat, however they are typically weak and easily beaten into the ground.
