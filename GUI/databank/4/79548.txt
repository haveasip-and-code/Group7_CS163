Sonyanese
A variation on English, made popular by Sonya. Many words are spelled phonetically in the way that they are commonly pronounced by [valley girl]s. Most words which are homonyms for multiple word groups are replaced with the word group that they sound like. Most verbs are appended with an 's' or 'es' as if they were plural nouns. Finally, some words are unique to the language, such as [hooha] and [drinkies].
