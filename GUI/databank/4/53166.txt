John Garcia
The husky vocalist of [Kyuss]. While Josh Homme and Queens of the Stone Age have had the most success after stoner fathers Kyuss split, Garcia is by far the most underrated. His other projects include Unida and Slo Burn, both are hard to get hold of. None of these compare to Kyuss though. Kyuss own.
