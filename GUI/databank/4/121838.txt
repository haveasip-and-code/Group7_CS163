ash ketchum
The 'hero' of the [pokemon] anime series. Named after a tree, like his other little friends, Professers Oak, Elm and Birch. ; His last name sounds like 'Catch 'em'. How original. ; Exceedingly crap at catching, raising and fighting with pokemon, he obviously uses a [Gameshark] or something because: ; a) His [pikachu] can affect rock and ground type pokemon and uses agility as an attack. ; b) His pokemon use WAY more than four moves ; c) His pokemon can evolve half-way through a battle ; d) He can come back from the dead or something if pokemon cry at him. ; I thought I was rid of him forever but it seems the pokemon loved him so much that they cried for him. Maybe they were crying with happiness that he was dead. Why didn't one of his other anime buddies use a MAX REVIVE on him or something? ; The actual gameplay was really fun in pokemon, he ruined it by looking, sounding and fighting like a dick, sullying the good name of pokemon forever.
