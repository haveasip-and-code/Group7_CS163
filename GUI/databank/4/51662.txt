dashdancing
Dashdancing (or DD) is a term usually referring to an advanced technique in [SSBM] in which the player jams his or her joystick left and right to make the character on screen dash left and right in place. This speeds up the time in which it takes to dash and also plays mind tricks with the opponent in guessing when you will strike.
