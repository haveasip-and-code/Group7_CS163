ISL
The Independant School League ; A league of prep schools in N.E. that basically live to make fun of everyone else...ie, all hate public schools in unity, and then each school hates every other school too...a sad circle of false unity spread by lies and false faces, actuality, a group of individuals with temporary allies and enemies...
