anti-zionism
While zionism has been around for over 100 years the anti-zionism movement arose during WWII. The anti-zionists rathered that the Jews fleeing from the Nazis seeking refuge in Israel have been slaughtered. They also feel that an Islamic Theocracy would have been better than a Jewish State. ; Don't be deceived, MLK reminds us that anti-zionsim = anti-semitism.
