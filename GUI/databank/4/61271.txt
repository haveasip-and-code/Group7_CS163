take one for the team
an act where one brave soul in your group of male friends hits on the [Nottie] of a group of hotties so his friends can get their [slide] on later on that night. taking one for the team usually involves just talking to the nottie and laughing at her jokes and complimenting her (horrid) appearance, but it may be necessary to appease the nottie by getting your wacka wacka on with her...back at her place of course, so your roomates never see her.
