The Sleeper
A 'professional' [wrestling] move where you put the [lockdown] on someone's face in an attempt to cut off the air supply to their brain. Since this type of wrestling is fake as shit, the 'sleepee' then pretends as if he/she has 'gone under'. This usually involves acting like your body has become totally [limp] and even taking it to the point of fake snoring. News alert: in reality, if someone cut off the oxygen to your brain, you wouldn't be snoring, you'd be fucking [dead]. ; The executor of the sleeper (upon putting his opponent under and the ref ringing the bell) then jumps up, prances around the ring in victory and then humiliates his opponent by any of the following: leg dropping him/her; ripping a juicy fart in opponent's open mouth; [depantsing] him/her; writing embarrassing sayings (in marker) on his/her bare skin; pulling a 'snake' out of a bag and laying it on his/her face; etc. ; At some point during the humiliation of the opponent, the sleepee's [posse] (who has obviously been watching from the dressing room) comes charging out to the ring, intent on kicking the executor of the sleeper hold's ass. After a couple closelines and head butts, the sleeper holder usually slides out of the ring (without suffering much damage) and retreats to the dressing room, taunting the crowd and the posse in the ring, every step of the way. ; Once all trouble has been cleared out, the sleepee is then put on a stretcher and dramatically carried out of the area.
