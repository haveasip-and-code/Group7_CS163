blame the pixel
The act of accusing a [pixel] of being at fault for something that goes wrong on your computer screen (or possibly something that goes wrong elsewhere). The expression was first used in relation to playing the computer game [Worms], because a single pixel on the terrain can sometimes affect whether you win or lose the round.
