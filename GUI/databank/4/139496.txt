Billy Idol
The only person to do pop music right in the last 30 years. Yes, he has an image. But in his case the stuffin's match the... um, CD cover. Awesome songs such as Rebel Yell and White Wedding. His recordings have an undefinable air to them that can't be explained. Proves that popular doesn't necessarily mean bad, and can mean awesome. The kind of person who doesn't give a shit and you can still look up to them just for them being who they are. Still looks good in leather pants. Makes all other rock and pop stars look like pretenders, especially considering he's still making new albums to this day.
