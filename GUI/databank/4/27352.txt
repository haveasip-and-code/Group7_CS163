metalcore
The latest trend in metal music... if you want to call it that. Metalcore is a genre crossbreed of heavy metal and hardcore that claims to be better than its nu-metal predecessors, which in some ways is true. However, metalcore is bad in it's own right. For example, every metalcore band sounds exactly the same, and god forbid the lead singers actually try to 'sing' for once instead of the usual incoherent bad screaming. Metalcore is also unappealing and unlistenable to all but a small audience of devoted fans, as the songs lack any real hooks which keeps it from getting too mainstream, a double-edged sword. Metalcore has its ups, however; most metalcore bands are at least twice as talented as their nu-metal counterparts (instrumentally) and lacks the annoying rap aspect of said music. Heavy Metal fans should own at least one decent metalcore CD from bands like 'Down the Sun' or 'Sinai Beach', if only for the sake of being obnoxious and blasting it in your car with the windows down.
