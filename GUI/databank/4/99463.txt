earth mama
A mother committed to long-term breastfeeding, co-sleeping, and carrying her babe in a sling. A proponent of Attachment-style Parenting. Other interests include green issues, and [new-age feminism]. Most commonly seen with long flowing hair, bare-feet, and baby suckling on her exposed breast. Yay!
