Bill Clinton
A very misunderstood man. The 42nd president of the united states, he has accomplished almost more than any other president in american history. he was impeached for something that should not have been a public afair, unlike the president of today who has lied and has not been impeached. In his term the economy was the best it has ever been, he created many treatys and alies throught the world, and did wonders to the welfare of the citizens of the united states. What most people overlook is the fact that he was one of the best presidents ever and instead focus on something that is not any of their business.
