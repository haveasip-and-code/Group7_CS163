Yun
A character in Street Fighter 3. Yun practices a martial art which seems to be rooted in Kempo, but I'm not certain. He has a (twin?) brother names Yang. Originally Yang was simply an alternate costume for Yun, but they are now separate characters. ; Yun is known for his relatively low defense and weak hits, which is balanced by his superb comboability. His most used super is his Genjin, which allows him to enter a Custom Combo mode, similar to that of A-groove in Capcom vs SNK 2. Using Yun requires you to be constantly on the offensive, while being very careful as to not be punished by you're opponents moves. He has no abusable pokes and his priority isn't anything to scream about. This makes him one of the more difficult characters to use. His only practical defensive move is his 'Palm Strike'. Yun's defensive tactics are pretty much 'counter with Palm Strike' or 'parry and counter'. Yun is really only recommended for advanced players due to the fact that he's severely unbalanced. A good Yun player is usually hard to find (unless you live in a big arcade spot), but fighting one is usually pretty annoying. ; NOTE: A watered-down version of Yun is also playable in Capcom vs SNK 2, but he isn't very popular in that game.
