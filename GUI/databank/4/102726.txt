vassili zaitsev
The greatest Russian/Soviet sniper, and one of the greatest snipers in history. At the Battle of Stalingrad, he pinpointed his German counterpart (Major Koenig), by tricking him into shooting at a glove on a stick, thus being able to see his muzzle flash and location. The result was that Zaitsev put a bullet in Koenig's head before he had time to chamber a new round (sniper rifles back then were bolt-action).
