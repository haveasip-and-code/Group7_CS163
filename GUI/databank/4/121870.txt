Vending Machine Random
The process of putting your change into a vending machine and mashing every button to recieve an unexpected and usually disappointing item. It is however funner than just selecting an item. ; If there are empty slots, thats just risky business. You have a chance of getting nothing!!! ; The results of a vending machine random usually are a lot of swearing and anger. Strangely enough, you will find youself doing it again.
