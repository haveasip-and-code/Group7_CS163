shiksa
A Gentile girl or woman, especially one who has attracted a Jewish man. The term derives from the Hebrew word 'sheketz', meaning the flesh of an animal deemed taboo by the Torah. Since a Jewish man marrying a non-Jewish woman is taboo also, this word applies to her. ; Traditionally this is a derogatory term, though in modern times it has also been used more light-heartedly. For example, [Seinfeld] once did an episode about Elaine's 'shiksa appeal'. ; The ideal shiksa is a blonde [WASP] who look like the opposite of a stereotypical Jew, but in reality, many shiksas are brunettes who might pass for Jewish themselves.
