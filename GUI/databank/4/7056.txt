nu metal
The reason [hipsters] were born -- in the late '90's, Bizkit and Korn were all the rage. Linkin Park and Staind dominated as well in the beginning of this decade. Since rock stations removed Weezer and Beck off the radio for this garbage, people who used to like rock either turned to online music magazines for guidance or switched to rap instead. Mp3 blogs and internet radio began stealing listeners from rock radio so now, because rock stations play ; either nu metal or old alternative (Weezer, Beck), modern rock stations are dropping quick. So next time some pretentious scenester sings some Futureheads song he heard off the OC, thank yourself and your red backwards baseball cap, Bizkit biter.
