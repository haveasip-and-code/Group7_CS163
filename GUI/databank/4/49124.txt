Episcapol High School
Spelled 'Episcapol' by jealous boys and girls who attend other private schools in northern Virginia/D.C., but spelled 'Episcopal' by everyone else with even the slightest intelligence. Founded in 1839 in Alexandria, Virginia, this boarding school affectionately nicknamed 'The High School' is the place to send your kids if you are southern, preppy, athletic, and intelligent. It was the first high school founded in the state of Virginia. The school's biggest academic and athletic rival is Woodberry Forest School in Orange, VA but for the past 15 years or so, Episcopal has been raising its standards of excellence thanks to the admission of females. Episcopal graduates usually attend colleges such as UVA, UNC, UGA, Vanderbilt, Davidson, W&L, Princeton, Harvard, Brown, Yale, Sewanee, Wake Forest, and Tulane. EHS has a tradition of excellence both in and outside of the classroom and tends to attract good-looking, athletic, and bright students. Students at Episcopal spend their free time playing lacrosse, roaming around in lilly, rainbows, and croakies, listening to 94.7 (THE ARROW), hanging out around Dal, or eating Maggie Moos at 'The Center'.
