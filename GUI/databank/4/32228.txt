Eat my shit!
An even more vulgar alternative to saying 'Kiss my ass!' when you are really pissed off at someone who did something to you that you didn't like, or when you can't think of a more original and witty comeback to use on someone who's insulting and/or threatening you. When you say this, you either may or may not attempt to make that person do said action.
