The Governor
A term widely used to describe the following sexual ceremony: While engaging in sexual intercourse, preferably from behind, and as the [money shot] approaches, the male 'doer' spits on his partners back. When he/she turns around in disgust, the 'doer' ejaculates into one eye of his partner and firmly punches the other eye, exclaiming 'you have been Governed!'. The 'doer', now also known as 'the Governor', then parades his triumph and is later honoured, by his judicators, with a t-shirt declaiming 'The Governor!'
