T.I
A skilled southern rapper who is praised by his peers as one of the hottest lyricists of the 21st Century. Very diverse in content matter, ranging from emotional and introspective songs (eg 'I Still Luv U') to smooth R&B anthems (eg 'Let's Get Away') to hard street anthems (eg 'You Don't Know Me') to braggadocious tracks which show off his lyrical ability and flow (eg 'I'm Serious'). Biggest hit to date is 'Bring 'Em Out' but was first given mainstream love after his mega-hit 'Rubberband Man.' Claims to be the 'King Of The [New] South,' which is not far from the truth. Represents Atlanta, Westside Bankhead.
