OBI hostel
Maybe the world's most fun, entertaining and sizzling party-hostel. Located just south of La Jolla, Pacific Beach and the Mission Bay in San Diego, CA. OBI Standing for Ocean Beach Int'l hostel, it's the place where not just (the majority tho) int'l travelers but also Americans party and have an awesome time staying.
