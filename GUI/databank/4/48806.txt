Rhinocotopolis
Rhinocotopolis was an anchient aborigine civilization discovered by the late great Rigel Rhinochoptapher the 18th century african archeologist in search of the lost treasure of Biotuken, the philosopher/treasure hunter extrodinare who is said to have burried his treasure in the deepest darkest caverns of the african plateaus. On his many journeys to the plains of Africa Rigel always seemed to come up empty handed, so he then decided to search the plateaus where the treasure was actually said to have been burried. Any way, on his way to the plateaus from the plains of Africa he discovered a tiny aborigine village. And it would seem that there was something amiss about this village, all of the aborigine's were albino. Though they carried out their day's as any normal aborigine would (Playing loud rap music, and shooting at each other) their skin color was not that of the average aborigine. Intrigued by this Rigel brought in outsiders to come and inspect the behavior of this seeming untouched anchient civilization. He brought in experts such as reverand jessie jaction, and dave chappelle to inspect the ways of these albino niggers, I mean aborigines. They preformed numberous experiments involving fried chicken and grape soda, all of which proving positive for aborigine, reguardless of skin color. 'well they definately arn't white' said Rigel ' and they definately arn't niggers' and so Rigel thought to himself 'by jove I'll call them Wiggers' and thus the term wigger was born. White trash all over the world would come to mourn this time, the time that Rhinocotoplois was discovered. And now Rhinocotopolis is used whenever referring a bit of white trash back to his homeland.
