emocore
What used to happen to creative hardcore punk musicians when they got sick of thrashing around and destroying the stage. Emotional lyrics, 'DC'-sound, with less strain and gravel thrown into the vocals. Well, that was when it started in the mid-80's. ; Nearly died during the mid-90's, but had a revival in the late 90's and early 2000's, especially with [At The Drive-In]'s 'Relationship of Command' and 'In/Casino/Out'. ATDI explored thier hardcore punk roots, with occasionally strained vocals and screaming, while sticking mostly to the DC sound and high register singing of emocore. ; Further extrapolation of these hardcore and hardcore punk roots back into emocore leads to music such as [Alexisonfire], [Thursday] and EP-era [Saosin]. These incorporate extensive use of screaming and hardcore-styled riffs, as well as soft, twinkly, DC-sounding moments. Many argue whether such bands are emocore, [post hardcore] or [screamo], but my scene refers to them as second-wave emocore, while first-wave emocore died with At The Drive-In.
