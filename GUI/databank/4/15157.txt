la jolla
The most beautiful and elite self-contained community of San Diego, home to such prestigious establishments as Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Salk Institute, La Jolla Playhouse, and, of course, The Cookie Lady. The average La Jollan is wealthy and, in most cases, tan. Though La Jolla is one of the most expensive places to live in the United States, it is a surf town at heart. ; Some believe La Jolla to be snobbish, but the community members are simply very dedicated to their community and its improvement. They love their home, and for very good reason. ; Windansea and Black's are the best beaches, La Jolla Farms is the most expensive residential area, and the view from the top of Mount Soledad is to die for. La Jolla was voted 'The Best Place To Live In America' in 2002.
