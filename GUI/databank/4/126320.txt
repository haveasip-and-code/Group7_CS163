Redneck District
Also known as a trailer park, or a lower-income neighborhood typically located in the Southwest, the Southeast, and the Lower Midwest. ; You know how most big cities have a 'red-light district'? It's kinda like that except a large town in one of these regions doesn't have one of these areas of town. Hence, they are replaced with a redneck district.
