wyckoff
Wyckoff is a great town in Northern New Jersey, Bergen County to be exact...It is an upper middle class area with a great school system...Parents can raise their children in this town and not have to spend one day worrying if something is going to happen to them...The place to hang out is boulder run, even though it kind sucks now that the cops are all over it so no one skateboards and stuff, but hey it has starbucks...The town is most know for having great labor day fireworks... ; Just a side not though, don't shop in the stop n' shop they aren't very nice there...
