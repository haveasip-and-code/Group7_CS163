State College
Location of Penn State's main campus to which all the branch students call 'Mecca.' ; Wanna get drunk? No problem! 21 bars within 2 square miles! ; Wanna get laid? Noooo problem! Frats are crawling with disease-infested freshman & sophomore students who will sleep with anyone who hands them a warm Milwaukee's Beast. ; Need an apartment? Noo problem at all! Just make sure you like getting screwed up the pooper with no lube every month. ; The residents hate the students, the students hate the residents, and the district court LOVES the steady income of money from the many crimes committed on Fridays & Saturdays.
