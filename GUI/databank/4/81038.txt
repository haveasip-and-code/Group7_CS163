Wingo
Originally applied to Halo, a 'wingo' is the action of using the butt of a weapon, particularly a flag, to hit someone in the back of the head. It is now applied a number of games which allow the player to perform a similar attack. It is to be shouted at optimum volume after said action is undertaken. Use in conjuction with [owned],[pawned]/[pwned] and [clipped]
