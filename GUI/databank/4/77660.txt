izan
A Jewish person who hates all Germans, because of the nazis. They don't realize it but they are being racists themselves. They often can be found blaming innocent Germans on the death of a distant relative during the holocaust. Therefore, since they are racists against Germans, its like the opposite of a nazi, its an izan (nazi spelled backwards).
