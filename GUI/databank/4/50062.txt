Sex Pistols
One of the most overrated bands in history. ; The band was extremely shitty. But they had a great producer so they sounded good on their album. They sucked extremely hard live though. Funny how a great producer can make a shitty band sound good. ; Wrote offensive lyrics about pretty much anything. They got popular because of that. They also put the 'anarchy' lable on punk music. You know, that sign Avril Lavigne uses too all the time, hahaha. ; All in all, a band that got famous because they pretty much hated everything and everyone. Their bass player sliced up his girlfriend and commited suicide after that. Or did he die from an heroin OD? Either way it wasn't pretty.
