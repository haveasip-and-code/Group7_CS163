1. an interesting japanese computer game where two fat guys and a goth chick battle evil monsters by chucking vegetables at them...the game was later repackaged as super mario brothers 2 in the USA ; 2. a narcissistic. yet incredibly insecure creature from the depths of birmingham uk, incredibly opinionated on the subject of creative form, doki is often seen snipering the successful contestants from the karaoke based 'fame academy' shows, we say good luck doki!
