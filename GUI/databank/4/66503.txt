East Village
A pseudo-artsy part of Manhattan. Filled with hipsters from [Williamsburg] who come on the L train to watch Bright Eyes at Webster Hall, and then promptly leave afterwards because no one can actually afford to live there. Lots of bars, homeless people asking for money, and geriatrics with walkers from Stuyvesant Town. Home to CBGBs, creepy Polish restaraunts, and thirft stores that charge $15 for a dirty T-shirt. Most people have no string opinions regarding East Village.
