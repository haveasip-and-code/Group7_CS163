tailgating
1) Usually found around sporting events, they involve [beer] drinking and [BBQ] from the back of a pickup truck or [SUV]. ; 2) The car that is so close to you in the rear that you can barely see it's headlights. Some people like to quickly brake to scare them off. Pretty annoying, but it's better to move to the right. Nobody likes a [Left Lane Dick]... unless there is no right lane. In that case, it's time for a [Skid Contest].
