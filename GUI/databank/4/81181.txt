no stats
no dice; no go; not available ; derives from days of hand-computed fantasy baseball stats. overeager owners (ie. steven blank) would call and hound the commissioner for the latest league statistics. one time, a flummoxed commissioner tony picked up the phone and screamed 'NO STATS' before slamming it back on its cradle.
