Don Pablo
Don Pablo is a hero. A reformed member of the mafia, he was once the lightweight wrestling champion. His short blue body weighs a mere 65 pounds, but he lives in a weight room, so he is pure muscle. He inspires little kids to not smoke marijuana, and to take care of their bodies. Young adolecents have picked him up and dropped him, hugged him, and even tackled him clear out of anothers arms. He to this day wears his comical grin, no matter the circumstances. I believe that Don Pablo is quite possibly the coolest person I know, so I think that you should go give him a hug.
