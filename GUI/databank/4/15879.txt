Fresa
-MEXICAN SLANG ; Usually a middle/high class wealthy type girl that always gets her way. Not necessarily preppy though..Girls that are fresas can't speak spanish consistently or that well, look like they are white, sometimes deny their culture or don't want to be what they are. They are really hard to get with, and are really spoiled. These 'fresas' talk diffrent from most other 'regular' mexican chicks...
