freaknik
Separate and apart from Spring Break, blacks leave college and descend either on Atlanta, the Gulf Coast, or a Florida beach area and go wild, sorta like they were in Africa before they were slaves. An escape from classes, it is almost a riot with riot police on patrol. It is hard to say what freaknik activities might be expected but always there is public loud music, cruising, breeding in public, drunkeness and brawls. Some refer to it as Black Spring Break.
