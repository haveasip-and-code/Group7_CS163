Aisha H
Basically, the coolest person in the world. She basicaly OWNS at golf too! Whenever she hangs out with my sister she wears her crown and pretends its her birthday, cause, basically, every day SHOULD be her birthday. She's just that awesome. You should really get to know her, but I'm sure that you're unworthy anyways.
