BOTAR
Stands for [Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution], an all acoustic band started by [Tomas Kalnoky]. They currently have one self released EP, entitled 'A Call to Arms' which contains five songs: a cover of 'Dear Sergio' by Catch 22, 'Here's to Life' by Streetlight Manifesto, and originals. There were few copies available, and they quickly sold out. The MP3's of the songs are available on their site for free, but there is some cool exclusive material for those who grabbed hold of the EP. For this first EP, there were 14 members in the band. ; Nick Afflitto - Trumpet ; Marcy Ciuffreda - Cello ; Jamie Egan - Trombone ; Rachel Goldstein - Vocals, Viola ; Layton Hayes - Piano ; Achilles Kalnoky - Violin ; Tomas Kalnoky - Vocals, Guitar ; Paul Lowndes - Drums ; Chris Paszik - Upright Bass ; Mark Rendeiro - French Horn ; Dan Ross - Bari/Alto Sax ; Pete Sibilia - Tenor Sax ; Shane Thomson - Congas, Timbales ; Natalia Ushak - Vocals ; [Streetlight Manifesto], Tomas' main act, occasionally plays BOTAR songs live. BOTAR is currently working on a new release, possibly full length, entitled '99 Songs of the Revolution.' Much is unknown about this ensemble, as few information is given away on their website. The ensemble is always changing, and you can sign up for an audition with the band on their website.
