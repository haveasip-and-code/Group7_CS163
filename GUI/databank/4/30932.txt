level 5 security clearance
derived from military security levels for access to classified info. i use it on a person or persons who needs permission before they are allowed to speak based on past experiences of saying the stupidest shit you've ever heard; use it especially on those who have a tendency to speak before thinking; i put 5 because thats the highest level i've heard in the army but you can use any number depending on how stupid the remark and your friends or random people are.
