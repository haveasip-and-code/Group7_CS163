Crack
Basically, crack is silly, intentionally non-serious, and has a high tendency to be extremely crazy and unfounded, such as purposeful [OOC]-ness or playing on cliches, inside jokes, and/or [fanon]. ; The term crack probably stems from crack as in crack cocaine, as opposed to a crack in a wall. As in, so horrendously unfounded/silly that only one could have come up with it while under the influence of crack.
