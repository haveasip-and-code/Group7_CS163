fox news
A far right neo-con 'talk show' that presents itself as news. In fact if the news does not favor their distorted view they focus on sensational tabloid stories of rape and murder to titillate the religious right that pretends morality. This show is so hilarious that I might even rate it as a comedy if it werent for the fact that some ignorant americans really believe it is fair and balanced. It is a show for lower IQ people who want to be reassured their small minds are correct and that everyone in the world who isnt white,right wing extremists re evil. Fox news hates you if you are Democrat, moderate thinking republican. Catholic, Lutheran,asian,black,hispanic, and the list goes on. They have a narrow box of extreme radical fundalmentalist with a corporate agenda and if you look closely rather perverted. The owner (Rupert Murdich' specializes in tabloids that exploit crimes against women and children then report every delicious sexual detail so the 'moral' religious right' can get their jollies while exclaing how hrrible everyone else is. It really promotes rich big corporations and Republicans like George W. and use their guise as a 'conservative' station to manipulate the average, easily manipulated person who wants to think of themselves as moral citizens while their mind is being filled with anything but factual news reporting. Wake up america and start watching C-span and see what is really happening.
