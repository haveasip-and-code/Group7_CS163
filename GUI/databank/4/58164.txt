BLINK 182
A pop punk band formed in 1992 by guitarist Tom Delonge and bassist Mark Hoppus. First drummer was Scott Raynor. Formally known as Blink, they had to change their name to avoid a lawsuit from an Irish band with the same name. ; Later on in 1997, Scott decided to leave the band to pursue his education, so new drummer Travis Barker joined. Since then, they have come out with 6 LPs. In 2005, the band took a break to spend more time with their families.
