portnoy's complaint
A book created by Phillip Roth. One would say it is about a Jewish kid losing his religion, until they notice the first 200 pages say 'cunt' 'pussy' 'wad' 'dong' 'dork' 'dick' 'putz' or 'fuck' at least twice a page. After that you could say it is about a Jewish kid losing his sex drive towards those whom he should stereotypically find atractive, Jewish girls, due to the actions of his parents.
