Furry
Someone who feels a need to post long-winded definitions of the word furry on the internet. These definitions generally avoid any sort of restricting or mundane structure, frequently sidetrack, cite historical cultures and personal spirituality, include [ad hominem] attacks on anyone who would dare to consider them strange, misuse the word [fandom], and generally avoid defining the word furry.
