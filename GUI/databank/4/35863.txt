existentialist
(n.) One who follows the philosophy of [existentialism]. ; Existentialists get a bad rap due to the fact that some [retards] treat it as if it's a philosophy of despair. However, it's quite the contrary. While the philosophy does state that life has no meaning, the notion is not intended to make the individual powerless, but rather empowered to live life with a sense of exuberance and accomplishment in order to give meaning to his/her existence. ; Furthermore, existentialism emphasizes individuality and personal responsibility for the ramifications that come with being an individual. Since the individual possesses the freedom of choice to choose his/her experiences and non-experiences, he/she is solely the one responsible for the consequences that come with these actions and non-actions. ; In layman's terms, you shouldn't be a bitch and direct the finger of blame at somebody else for the shitty decisions you make in the process of finding yourself. ; (adj.) Genearlly, a bullshit term the valley girls of the intellectual world will apply to describe, fallaciously(!!!), something synonymous to 'angsty/edgy but, still, like, totally cool.' These sentiments further tarnish the existentialist movement.
