Happy Tree Friends Forums
See [Happy Tree Friends]. (The following definition is based on the cartoon's forums.) ; A crazy place where spam runs rampant, furries talk about how they want to sex up the characters, emo and goth 8-11 year olds post about how they want to commit suicide and the occasional smartass enjoys flaming people on a totally unrelated topic. Also common is a thread which argues on a cartoon character's freaking gender. ; The ratio for on-topic posts to spam is 1:12. Most on-topic threads aren't worth reading anyway because they'll turn into a flamefest within 5 posts. ; In some cases, the boards have actually been used as an insult on other message boards. (i.e 'Go back to the HTF forums you scum!') ; If you like Happy Tree Friends, steer clear of the message boards because it will warp the way you see the show itself.
