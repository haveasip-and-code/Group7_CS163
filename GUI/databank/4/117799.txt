Absinthe
green alcohol drink. Good stuff is halucenogenic. Bad stuff just gets you drunk as hell. Either way it's worth it. Tastes horrendous. Tastes good with a bit of chocolate candy. Reccomend drinking it with a sugar cube. If your gonna have an international plane flight the next day. I reccomend stopping some where short of puking drunk if you can manage it. Because if you don't puke the hangover is pretty manageable.
