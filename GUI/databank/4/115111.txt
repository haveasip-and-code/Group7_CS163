The Edge
Real name David Evans, The Edge is the guitarist for the famous Irish rock band [U2], known for his love of effect pedals, harmonics, 'sonic soundscapes' and 'less is more.' He has a very minimalist style, so when he really rocks out in songs such as 'The Fly' (from the 1991 album 'Achtung Baby') the effect is far greater. Possibly best known for his intro to the song 'Where the Streets Have No Name' from the 1987 album The Joshua Tree, which is essentially a four-note arpeggio done repeatedly but is regarded as one of the greatest intros of all time.
