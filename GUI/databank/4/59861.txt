Fatal1ty
Fatal1ty, who's real name is Johnathan Wendel, is the self-proclaimed 'best PC gamer in the world'. In all honesty he is one of the worst 'professional' gamers alive today. Most true PC gamers also like to point out that his persona reeks strongly of homosexuality. ; His existence has been greatly popularized by the release of ABIT motherboards bearing his same name. Regardless, no amount of marketing can rid him of his ever-present gay aura.
