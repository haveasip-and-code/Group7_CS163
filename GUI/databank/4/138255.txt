Suffern
A small piece of Rockland County. Contains next to nothing, besides a few strip malls. Downtown Suffern can also be referred to as 'Little Mexico', as well as DTS. The schools in this town are crap, starting from the elementary schools.[Suffern High School] is infested with STDs, whores and people who are racially confused.
