Unfriend
The act of removing people from your 'friends list' on LiveJournal just to let them know you hate them, and you hope they die. In fact, you don't just hate them and hope that they die, but you hope they die a long, slow, painful, gut wrenching death. Preferably in a Turkish Prison that is overrun with skin eating mutant leeches.
