vanilla
Nature's favorite form of torture. It smells wonderful, but tastes FUCKING AWFUL by itself. This means you experience and desire great tastes, but don't actually get to satisfy your want. Quench your need. Make you happy. Oh no, you can only smell and wish. ; (While some coffee is like this in the fact that it smells better than it tastes, vanilla smells better than any coffee I've ever smelled. Vanilla > You.) ; It's also the most common ice cream flavor.
