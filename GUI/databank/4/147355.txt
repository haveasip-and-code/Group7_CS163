Roommate
Someone who claims to be your friend, but once you move in with them 'forgets' to pay you back for rent/electiric/cable/ethernet, bitches about dishes in the sink when they all belong to her, forces you to get rid of your cat by pretending they are allergic to it, destroys your furniture, pretends to be depressed to get attention, and generally freaks out about the stupidest things imaginable. ie: A roommate is a spoiled bitch who either can't or refuses to clean, and is used to mommy and daddy giving her everything.
