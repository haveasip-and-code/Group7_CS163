fizzback
After rapid consumption of continental strengh fizzy lager the fizzback is a very real possibilty. The victim is suddenly overwhelmed by a sudden urge to chunder, which leaves no room for tactical evacuation. Luckily for the victim the chunder is gas based and can be easily passed off as a mere fizzback rather than a more socially unaceptabble public vomitting. But, be warned, if the fizzback is stifled by covering the mouth, it will escape from the nearest orrifice, most usually the nostrils, but in extreme circumstances the eyeballs.
