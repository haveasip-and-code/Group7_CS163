Was in WWF only had about 10 matches on the lower level shows. One Against Jeff Hardy when Hardy was still with Michael Hayes. ; AJ . Overly hyped superstar. Yes is great but not as great as he is presetned as. Should Never have beaten likes of Raven at any time. ; NOw about to Face Samona Joe in super X Cup
