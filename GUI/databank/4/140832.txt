Fat Girl Tumble
when one falls backward as such: firstly, one must be FAT. secondly, there must be a rock behind one. Now, see, a person pushes another (the fat one) and they fall back. Not like a stumble, but a stiff complete straight fall. When you hit the ground your lege fly up at the speed of light and then they fall back. This is one motion. At the same time your arms are falling. This is known as the fat girl tumble. Degrassi was the inspiration for this. Look for Terri falling, shes the fat one.
