FASTCORE
Although a music type much like THRASH, the term THRASH is too closly related to METAL, THRASH METAL, and the like. Don't get me wrong all mentioned above rule!!! Fastcore is a more clean sounding, usually non grinding guitars, abrasivly fast drums (blast beats), with usually mid to higher pitched screamin vocals...?
