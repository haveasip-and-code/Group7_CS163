PWEI
a decent group from 1990s ( [Trent Reznor] was inspired by these guys) they fused Punk, Rap, Industrial, dodgy samples, and indie dance way before Primal Scream turned tried to do this and Limp Bizkit's piss poor rap metal took over. have now reformed and hopefully will get the respect they deserve.
