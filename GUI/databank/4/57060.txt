crowbar
The most revolutionary weapon ever to be seen in a game. Can be used for prying headcrabs off of zombies, breaking off Combine heads, cracking open boxes and 2x4's, and trying to kill G-Man. First acquired weapon in Half-Life 1 and 2. Not to be underestimated, especially in the hands of an expert such as Gordon Freeman.
