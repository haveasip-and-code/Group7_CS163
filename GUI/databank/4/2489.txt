The Libertines
The Libertines are a British band who love British culture, drugs, alcohol, sex, and rock and roll. Considered by some to be 'the only current band that actually acts like a real rock and roll band' due to their infamously scandalous history. ; The members are Pete Doherty (notorious adorable crackhead sleazegod) on guitar/vocals, Carl Barat (seedy yet respectable sex idol with the best hair and arse) on guitar/vocals, John Hassall (more quiet member, favored by Adam Green, with famous cheekbones) on bass, and Gary Powell (Sadly sometimes ignored yet absolutely amazing) on drums. The media however, LOVES focusing on the troubles and love-hate relationship of Pete and Carl, thus the other 2 members are hardly seen.
