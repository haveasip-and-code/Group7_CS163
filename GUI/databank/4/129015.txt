cabbage head
A resident of the Atlanta, Georgia, neighborhood known as Cabbagetown. This neighborhood was historically inhabited by the workers in the nearby cotton mill. These original cabbage heads were white working-class people from Appalachia. Since the mid-1990s, the neighborhood has been taken over by artists, slackers, and eventually, yuppies.
