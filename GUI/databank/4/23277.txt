originality
The way it's used currently, is to deviate from the norm. This is horrifically overrated, and because it's the [non-conformist] thing to do, other people who feel the same and do the exact same thing are more similar than they are different, even if they are alone. These people are insane, and clearly do not understand the true meaning of originality, like previous definitions state.
