de la soul
New York trio of MCs Pasemaster Mase, Posdnuos and Dave and producer Prince Paul which shot up into fame with their first album '3 Feet high and Rising' 1989. Very Dope. Very Influential. I would say most NY groups are influenced by their style. Often collaborates with A Tribe Called Quest, Jungle Brothers and Mos Def as the Native Tongues Posse. Recently released 'Grind Date' album which is dope as hell and you should all get it if youy wanna listen to the daddies of modern hip-hop.
