needle freak
Drug world expression for a drug user who gets a thrill from just feeling a needle go into the body - even if no drugs are involved. ; Comes from the Pavlovian stimulus/rsponse theory that after repeated use, the feel of the needle, followed by the rush of the drug will soon no longer require the drug to get the rush.
