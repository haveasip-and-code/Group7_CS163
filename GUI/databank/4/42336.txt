Scanman
A rapper who was with The Killa Klan Kaze, Kame Kaze, and the Thugz from da Southside Kazed out 2000 mass destruction album. He made numerous apperances with Three Six Mafia like Dont make me Kill, be a witness, and some other shit. His rhymes were fucking santanic as hell, and rapped sorta like Koopsta Knicca.
