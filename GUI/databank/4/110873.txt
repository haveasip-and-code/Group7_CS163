Joseph Smith (v)
An American prophet of God. Joseph Smith sought to know which of all churches was true, and following an examination of religions of the day, determined to ask God. In the spring of 1820, Joseph went into a grove of trees to ask for an answer. God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to the young man and called him to a great work. ; Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, ancient Scripture that testifies of Jesus Christ and His visit to the Americas. ; According to revelation and instruction from God, Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on 6 April 1830. ; The Lord told Joseph that his name would be had for good and evil throughout the generations, and ever it has been. While many insult this Prophet, the Church he started grew from 6 members in 1830 to over 12 million in 2005. ; Joseph Smith was an honorable man who sought all his life to fulfill God's work and will on earth. Finally, Joseph gave his life in testament to the work when an angry, evil, jealous mob martyrd him in Carthage, Illinois in June 1843. Joseph was being held on false and spurious charges and under the alleged protection of the State of Illinois and the Governor when the mob murdered him in cold blood, together with his brother Hyrum.
