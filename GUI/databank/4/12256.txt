ghost recon 2
The ass kicker of games, i played it this weekend on Xbox. I personally think its better than Halo 2. Halo 2 doesn't even have co-op on live, thats shitty, but Ghost Recon 2 on the other hand... YOU CAN DO 16 PLAYER CO-OP!!! ITS THE SHIT!!! GET IT!! it comes out for PS2 on December 1st.
