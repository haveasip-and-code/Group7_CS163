yarl
To sing like Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam. People like Scott Stapp (Creed), Jason Wade (Lifehouse), Alex Band (The Calling), are known for having Vedder-like voices. Another person known for yarling would be Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots, Velvet Revolver), but after he was trashed for yarling like Vedder, he gradually began to sing differently and now sounds nothing like Vedder. ; Although it has been said that Eddie Vedder's yarling was taken from people such as Ray Charles and Bruce Springsteen, the similarity between Vedder, Charles, and Springsteen is nowhere near as close as Vedder, Stapp, Wade, and Band.
