Hicksville
Hicksville. a.k.a. the ville. ; In New York, there is Long Island, east of NYC. On Long Island, almost perfectly in the center, is the slowly-but-increasingly urbanized town of Hicksville. The best thing to come out of here was Billy Joel. (said the school nurse, i have yet to hear a billy joel song)We don't have a separate identity from anything else. Our only cultural outlet is New York City. I have to leave here. I have to get back to my birthplace, new york city.
