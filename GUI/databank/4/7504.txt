ige.com
An internet site that sells Gold and Silver, the virtual currencies of World of Warcraft, for US Dollars, the real currency of the United States of America. Also known as a huge ripoff, also known as a boon for spoiled WoW noobs who want to buy armor that that's recommended for players twice their level. ; However, if you're an avid World of Warcraft player that's near or at the level cap, you can sell gold to IGE for real money, and potentially offset the $14 a month you pay for the game itself. Get rich quick. ; IGE also trades in the currencies from other games, although nobody plays Everquest or FFO anyways, so it's not really notable.
