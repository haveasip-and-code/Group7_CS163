Linkin Park fan
Someone who usually claims nobody 'gets' them. They always cry about how bad their parents are even though they get anything they want. Usually wear wrist bands or some ridiculous looking long sleeve shirt under their t-shirt to cover their arms, so nobody sees their razor cuts. They wear a studded belt and paint their finger nails black.
