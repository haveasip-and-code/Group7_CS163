postmodernism
A reaction to the work of Modern philosophers, most of whom created vast systems of meaning founded upon one central concept. In many religions, the central and beginning premise is some supreme being or concept. The postmodernist critique removes that central concept, it 'decenters' the system of meaning. Postmodernism points out that all systems of meaning are in constant negotiation and flux, therefore claims of transcendant morality are suspect. ; Furthermore, postmodernism critiques all claims of 'objective' truth by revealing that human subjectivity always exists in every truth proposition. Due to the pervasive effects of subjectivity, postmodernist critiques are critical of all sweeping claims concerning social policy, truth, justice, morality, and ethics. ; Finally, postmodernism is a school of thought which examines the traditional 'either/or' dichotomies in modern philosophy, and reveals that these supposedly neutral dichotomies actually favor one side over the other.
