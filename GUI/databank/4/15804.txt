flute
The best instrument in the world. People like to make fun of it for the whole American pie thing and how high it is, but they're really just in awe of its supreme glory! You know that saying, about jealous people? Yeah. ; Anyway flutes are generally made out of metal (silver, nickel, gold, platinum, alloys, etc) although Baroque flutes are often made out of wood. Flutes can play lower than most people expect. ; Did I mention it's prettyful?
