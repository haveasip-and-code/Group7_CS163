Earth
The 3rd planet in oour solar system, approximately 93 million miles from the Sun. It has one moon, called the Moon (real original), and its surface is over 70% water. There are 7 landmasses on the surface: N. America, S. America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica. ; The dominant species is the human. We spend half of our money trying to teach people and cure diseases, and the other half trying to find ways to kill other people (i.e. napalm, shotguns, TNT, machine guns, howitzers, thermonuclear weapons, etc.) The planet is plagged by a terrible affliction called AIDS, which is the result of HIV. No matter what, it started with someone having unprotected sex or someone sharing a dirty syringe. Or a man being bit by a monkey (I hope to God that monkey is burning in hell now).
