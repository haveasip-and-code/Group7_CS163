Kingdom Of Loathing
An online text-based RPG created by the excellent Jick. Highly original and imaginative, and hilarious too. All the graphics are based on black-and-white stick figures. ; Don't let the graphics and text put you off. Not for brain-dead people who only favour RPGs with high resolution graphics and cannot spell. ; One of the only RPGs online with some sort of interlectual value, who appreciate the ability to write properly and makes intelligent observations of the actual world around you. None of the obsessive crap, as you get 'adventures' everyday which limit the amount of time you spend on the computer.
