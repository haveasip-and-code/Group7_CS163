Chii
1. A persocom specifically created to be the second daughter of a scientist's family. Her real name is Elda. She lost her memory after her dying older sister, Freya, also a persocom, installed her memories into her. Her parents hid her away, by a pile of garbage, hoping someone would find her. She was found by Hideki Motosuwa. When she awoken, the only thing she could say was, 'Chii.' And that is how she received that name.
