typing of the dead
A spin-off version of the video game, [House of the Dead]. Instead of using the traditional gun to shoot zombies, you are to use a keyboard to help practice your WPM (words per minute). ; This version removes most of the scary elements, and replaced it with humor. (The main characters carry a Dreamcast on their back). Zombies throw spatulas instead of axes.
