Nokia
A Finnish company specialising in communications equipment. Many people know Nokia for their cellphones, however they also market complete comms systems, DSL equipment, and cable TV components. ; Nokia sells mainly 'candybar' type phones marketed to techy nerdular types, however they sell handsets in the extreme low end (1100) and the extreme high end (Vertu) of the market. ; They sell more handsets than anyone else. ; The Nokia name is impossible to pronounce correctly in English because there are sounds in it that don't exist in English.
