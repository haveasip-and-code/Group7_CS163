rurouni
[Samurai](from 1600-1868)who formally abolished their title for reasons varying from regret over those they had killed to the death of a master, lover or close friend. They rebuked their title and wandered around Japan with their swords, keeping them as grim reminders of their pasts. Often times they had no money and lived off the generosity of others.
