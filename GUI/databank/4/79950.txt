shock value
The only value in filthy, disgusting, violent, or obscene materials in the media (television shows, movies, online forums, etc.). Ironically, these things have become so common that even the [shock value] is gone, leaving their existence pointless and the masses desensitised (or disgusted). ; The reason half the definitions on UD exist.
