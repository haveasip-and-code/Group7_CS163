Bottom line is, its a kickass and original movie defintitely worth the time to sit down and watch and more than likely you will totally enjoy it. ; Don't listen to the moron's post above in which he basically calls the movie a sellout. He is just a plain person that trys to make his individuality through likeing movies that very few other people know about because he thinks that makes him cool. If the movie kicks ass then who gives a shit what other people think or how many other people like it. ; Watch this movie!
