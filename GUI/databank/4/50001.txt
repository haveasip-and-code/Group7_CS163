elite
A noble creature of high stature. It stands seven feet tall and has impressive musculature. Commonly seen on the battlefield, it's rank can be derived from the color of armor it wears. Blue is the common color of the foot soldier and red denotes a command position. There have been sightings of golden elites, some believe they hold the highest command rankings, and a soldier reported to have seen a white elite once, however there were no other reports. It appears that the ranking system is based on the number of kills in combat the elite has had. Truly magnificent soldiers.
