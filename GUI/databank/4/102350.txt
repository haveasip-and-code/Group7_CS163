anarchism
A system of government (or lack there of) where everyone can do their own thing (that means ANYTHING) Anarchism is an idiots version of socialism, i.e. the state is the people and thereby serves the people by working for the common good, and halting those who do not (in most cases, corporations)-socialism. The funny thing about anarchism is, with no government to hold down greedy companies, anarchism becomes 'corportate republicanism', (Sid Meyers, Civilization) whereby big business controls every aspect of life, from utilities and the military, to your paycheck and children's education, and the only democracy is between the leaders of major business around the globe. In essence, rather than bringin us towards a utopia, anarchism bring us closer to the ultimate exploitation of the human race.
