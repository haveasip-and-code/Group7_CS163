WSBA
Acronym for the 'Washington State Bar Association.' Also, 'Won't Stop Bad Attorneys.' Colloquialism. Pronounced Wauzbuh. Stems from blatant abuses to legal consumers which are seemingly condoned or ignored by the WSBA and Supreme Court. Despite voluminous complaints and damages, the WSBA historically does too little, too slowly, to protect Washingtonians from unscrupulous attorneys who violate the rules of professional conduct.
