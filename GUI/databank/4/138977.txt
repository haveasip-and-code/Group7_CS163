.50 Action Express
The .50 Action Express is a powerful rebated rim cartridge developed by Evan Whildin (NOT the Israeli Army)of Action Arms specifically for the IMI Desert Eagle (NOT a close range combat pistol) The rim diameter of the .50 AE is the same as the .44 Remington Magnum cartridge for whcih the pistol was already chambered, consequently only a barrel and magazine change is required to convert a .44 Desert Eagle to the larger, more powerful .50 AE. All Desert Eagle pistols are gas operated automatics with a rotating bolt locking system similar to that found on the AR15 M16 rifles. The recoil of the .50 AE Desert Eagle is roughly approximate to 240 grain .44 magnum ammunition fired from a heavy revolver such as a Ruger Redhawk. Significant but not life changing.
