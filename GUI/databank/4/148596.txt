Mini-Core
Typically 12 - 13 year old Middle School boys and girls who have become enveloped in the 'Hardcore Scene'. Often seen wearing band shirts, sporting guaged ears, handing out papers with Myspace URL's pre- written, and attending local hardcore shows. They also love hitting on band members almost twice their age.
