Phil Anselmo
Ledgend. ; He was with Pantera. Had a bunch of side prohjects. Superjoint ritual and Down being the two major ones. He played guitar on the Superjoint ritual Cd`s `Use once and destroy` and `A Lethal dose of american hatred` I describe them as `perfcted garage rock` people just expected a lot more from him. Personally, I find both cd`s very good, same ol phil. Down is more melodic and relased 2 cd`s also `Nola` in 95` and `Down II` Down is more melodic and in general is thought to have more musical depth than superjoint ritual. I also belive Rex is playing with them, Rex being the old Bass player of Pantera. ; Everyone hates phil. Not me, I love the fact he`s an asshole. He`s a successful herion addict. How many people do you know that have lived thier entire life addicted to a substance and lived, and he`s still going strong. He is a God of metal. Who cares if the guy is an asshole, listen to the music.
