Roaming Gnomes
Little, dwarf-like creatures with pointy red hats. By day, you may see them frolick merrily in people's gardens alongside tulips and fresh soil, though at night they are rumored to steal your undergarments, preferably socks. Some believe this is in protest of them being decorative lawn ornamnents.
