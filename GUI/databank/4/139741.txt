True Gamer
Hard-core gamers who take games seriously. They don't quit after two deaths. True gamers not only appreciate the graphics, AI, and other things, but they KNOW HOW TO PLAY. (Unlike some cocky noobs.) True gamers are the people who may\will buy books about the game, talk about it over the phone, and buy the soundtracks. A TG never panicks, they always find ways to come out on top. TGs acknowledge the fact that they can not be the best, but appreciate their skill anyway. They also don't gloat or shove it in peoples faces, they just nod their head when they rack up a kill, beat someone on the racetrack, or score a touchdown. (ETC.) Of course, if its the computer you're playing against, you can give it the finger, because AI aren't human. TGs analyze games without thinking about it, and decide whether it is really a good game or not. Noobs will complain about how unrealistic a game is. Wake up idiots, Video games ARE ALL UNREALSITIC. They aren't real life.
