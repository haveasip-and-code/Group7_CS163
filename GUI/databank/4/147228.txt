Goody
A man who can do no bad. This person will abstain from DRINKING, smoking, lying, fornication and many other evils. This good man, also called Goodman, does not shy away from sports. He excels at sports such as chess. Physical sports such as basketball or even dodgeball are far to difficult a task. A Goody is very unsuccessful with the ladies. In fact, the ladies will only come to him out of pity.
