corpse bride
Tim Burton's most recent (Sept. 2005) film, in which he employs stop-motion, one of the most arduous processes in film-making. The plot is based on a Jweish-Russian folktale in which betrothed man jokingly recites his wedding vows and places the ring on a stick-life form, which happens to be a dead woman's finger, thus she comes back to life and claims that they are lawfully wedded. Wow I sound so pro... Anyway it's a great film by a mesmerizing genius with fantastic music by Danny Elfman. The characters and their portrayals are wondeful, as well as the storyline. Go see it! It's Tim Burton's!
