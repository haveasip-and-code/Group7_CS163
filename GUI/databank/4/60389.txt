farmingdale
A town comprised of many males who aspire to nothing but sports. Even though the entire school is obsessed with sports such as Football and Lacrosse, farmingdalers have something to show for it. No matter how much Massapequa may think they are better than farmingdale in such said sports... they..sadly are NOT. Proven so after Farmingdale took home the LI Championships in football.
