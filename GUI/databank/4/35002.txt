idaho
idaho is a very open state with lots of mountains and fields and is known to be very beautiful. it also has nice towns that are NOT filled with neo-nazis and potato farmers like sun valley, a nice sophisticated ski resort (home to arnold schwarzenegger, demi moore, bruce willis, tom hanks, mariel hemingway, and many others). it is true that idaho is a republican state by majority, but there are areas in idaho that are decent.
