mullet
A hair cut with the front short (business in front) and the back long (party in back). Like The force, There is a dark side of the mullet kingdom, led by an evil lady with a crazy mullet down my road. There is also a good side. This kid I saw a a lake, about 5 years old, had the best mullet in the world. He leads the good side with all his glorius mulletude. However, a mullet cannot be grown. It has to be trimmed (in the front only). You cannot start off bald and spontaneously grow one. One day one child will be born with a mullet. He will also grow mullets, and will not have to cut the front to keep it 'business in front'. He will be the Redneck Messiah.
