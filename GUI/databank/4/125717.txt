mothers against hard rock
A shadowy group of mothers opposed to 'hard rock' music. So far they have targeted popular post-hardcore/screamo/emo/whatever you want to define them as bands [My Chemical Romance] and [the Used]. This is considered by many an attack on the 1st Amendment right to free speech and a petition started on the internet as a protest to this has gained over 4,000 signatures so far. This group (MAHR) appears to have no known website (at least a Yahoo search turned up nothing) and little appears to be known about it at this time except that they are trying to ban bands that many people love.
