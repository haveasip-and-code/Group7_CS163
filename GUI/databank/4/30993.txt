gym
A holy temple to those who do not have a serious job and are not attending college. A gym usually has free weights, weight machines, benches, and a track or track machines for cardio workouts. ; To utilize the power of the gym, one must be there for a majority of the days of the week, a few hours at a time, working on different areas of the body each day. Do not be one of the idiots who goes there just to bench press... that is a [guido workout] and will give you nothing but [man boobs].
