shelf bra
Shelf bra is a type of bra that does not cover the nipples or the upper portion of the breasts. Its function is to lift the breasts up and provide some form of support (or so they claim). Highly impractical for daily use, serves 3 real functions: ; 1. Lifts the breasts, making them look full and firm under a sweater or such ; 2. Makes the nipples prominent under clothing ; 3. Makes a girl look like a porn star, which may spice up a couple's sex life. ; For bedroom usage, a shelf bra may be paired with matching panties, garterbelts, stockings etc.
