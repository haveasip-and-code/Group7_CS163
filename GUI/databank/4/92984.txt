Kirby Dude
A user fairly unknown on the Gamefaqs board Life The Universe and Everything, or LUE, and LUElinks. With the creation of upLUEd, a website for the LUEsers to share their favorite downloads, he gained fame for uploading massive amounts of music, including the entire Pink Floyd discography, Dream Theatre and Frank Zappa discography. These caused him to come out of the shadows on relative unknownity. Sadly, upLUEd was taken down due to the IRAA and his music fame faded. He still posts very frequently on LUElinks and has garnered much love from the users.
