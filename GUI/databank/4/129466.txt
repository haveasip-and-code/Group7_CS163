post rock
Post rock is a genre of rock music coined by British music Simon Reynold as 'using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbres and textures rather than riffs and powerchords.' Post Rock will often times be built like classical music with different movements and emphasis on musical composition and dynamic movements. Common instruments used by post rock bands are guitars and basses as well as drums, auxillary percussion, string instruments, pianos, and even bagpipes and the occasional tape loop run through the record.
