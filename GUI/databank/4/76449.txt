Thara
The prettiest, smartest, most loved girl in school. Everyone is crazy about Thara, even the guy at the Golden Skate, Manuel. And Eric, the guy with the mustache. People come flocking to her when they see her on the streets and they can't help themselves, while Tham is sitting there like a nerd alone.
