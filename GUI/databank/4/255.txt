estate agent
A highly stupid non-professional white collar worker with a complete absence of communication or organisational skills. Able to charge a fee for either doing f*ck all, delaying every transaction or movement involving property, or just generally being an annoying c*nt. Couldn't organise an explosion in a bomb factory.
