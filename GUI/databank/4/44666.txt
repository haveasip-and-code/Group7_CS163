Quad Cities
A set of four cities on the Mississippi River including Davenport and Bettendorf of Iowa, and Moline and Rock Island of Illinois. It is debatable whether or not East Moline of Illinois is included. It is well known for being the headquarters of John Deere, Whitey's Ice Cream, the only place where the Miss. runs East-West, and an interesting flavor of both states.
