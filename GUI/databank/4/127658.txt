Ridley
A large, highly intelligent purple dragon like creature in the Metroid games. He has appeared in every metroid game besides metroid II and Metroid prime 2. He is highly intelligant and is a war strategy genoius. There is some debate as to weather he is a creation of the space pirate forces, controlled by the Mother Brian, or if he is himself the leader of the pirate forces. a robotic version of ridley was built and dubbed 'mecha-ridley' while his remains where repaired with cybernetic enhancements such as stinger missle lauchers, force feild powered wings, enhanced alloy armor, and mouth emmited laser beam, In this form he was called 'Meta-Ridley'. In Metroid Fusion his frozen remains where posessed by an X-parasite and he became a larger bulkier creature known as 'X-Ridley'.
