Ganstanger
A person who owns a mustang, with these issues: Clutch burnt out at 3500 miles. Warranty replaced. ; Shifter got stuck between gears from new (possibly cause of the clutch going out). Dealer wouldn't fix because he said it was normal and I laughed when he couldn't get it into gear to pull it out of the shop. ; Warped head at 7500 miles. Dealer replaced it, but commented that I must have been running the car hard to cause this sort of damage. ; Power front seat was broken after I got it back from the dealer after head work being done. Dealer replaced. Would also run hot after the head was replaced.
