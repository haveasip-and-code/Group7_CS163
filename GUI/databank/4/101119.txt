Elvis Ramone
One of the least known members of the Ramones. He is also the drummer of Blondie (the band). In the revolving door of the drummers for the Ramones -- Tommy, Marky, Richie -- Elvis came in at a time when Marky was too much of an alcoholic and before they got the uberquick drumming of Richie. He played for a few gigs before they kicked him out for better punk drumming talent.
