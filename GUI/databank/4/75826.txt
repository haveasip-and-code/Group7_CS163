Phillips Academy Andover
Phillips Academy Andover, known nationally as Andover, is a coeducational, preparatory boarding school in Andover, MA. Andover has been known as 'the most preppy' or 'quintessential' United States prep school, but over time has worked to shed that distinction. ; Andover students are the brightest of the bright, with nearly 65% of each graduating class matriculating at a top 20 University. Therefore, competition is high and the tension on campus is great. When combined with the 'Andover bubble' effect students experience, the high-tension atmosphere of Andover leaves students to drinking and drugs. However, it seems these activities have little negative impact on either the grades or the pyschologies of the students. ; All in all, alumni feel an increasing love for the school as time passes, despite the feeling of desperation many felt while in attendance. ; The school is located 25 miles north of Boston; students have no dress code; there are approximately 1100 students; there are 35 AP certified classes offered and the Physics department was recently hailed 'the best in the world' by College Board.
