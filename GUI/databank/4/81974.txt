The Master and Commander of all things on earth. (see also: [god]) He strikes down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger on those who attempt to poison and destroy his brothers. And you will know he is the Lord when he lays his vengeance upon you. Resides on EFnet, mostly idle, but always there.
