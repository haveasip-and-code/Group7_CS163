Franz Ferdinand
A band representing the national trend of taking a good, out-there, little-known band and blowing them up to the point that they are no longer good and out-there. This can be especially frustrating for those that purchased their CD before anyone else even knew who they were. Other examples of this include Coldplay and the movie Napolean Dynamite.
