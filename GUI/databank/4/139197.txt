Interstate 8
MOne of Modest Mouse's Albums. Which has a greater meaning, but you have to think about it and actually listen to the song ' Interstae 8' It says, ' I drove around for miles, I drove around for days, I drove around for months and never even got no place' also thinkk of the actual number 8, it is the sign for infinite only right side up, so basically Interstae 8 is a never ending Interstate.
