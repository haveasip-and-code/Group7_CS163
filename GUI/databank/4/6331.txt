Cicada
Male member of intellectualwhores forums who lost his [virginity] to a [stripper] when he got way too [drunk]. CLAIMS he doesn't remember. Note that he also lost a $1,200 lighter (probably at the [club]), and had the indecency to tell the [bouncer] that it was 'worth more than his monthly salary'. It is unexpected that he will ever see that lighter again, but since he is a rich person, he'll just waste money on another. No big deal.
