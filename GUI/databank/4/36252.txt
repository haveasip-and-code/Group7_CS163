shot not
When a group of people have to designate someone to do something for the group (ex. get beer, get napkins, get ketchup, or other stuff like that), someone calls shot not and places a finger on their nose. the last person to put their fingers on their noseand yell 'shot not' or 'shot' for short is the [loser] and has to do the activity that no on wanted to do. most of the time there are multiple shot nots, and they are called by the loser who is just trying to get someone else to do it, but you shouldn't participate in those shot nots because they are not real. ; online shot nots do not count unless there is a [chat room] with more than 4 people in it.
