Maoism
A branch of Communism created by Mao Zedong. This branch differed greatly from [Marxism]. ; For instance, Karl Marx thought that economies had stages they went through such as slavery, feudal, ect, until you get to capitalism. Marx taugt that capitalism would eventually lead way to the next stage of communism. ; Mao Zedong lived in a country with a bunch of peasents. However, he thought China would do pretty well as a communist country even though he was breaking with the very basics of Marxist thought. So he got some peasents, killed people, and took over the government. From peasents to communism, only not real communism. ; Marx taught that the prolaterians (see [proletarian]) were supposed to take over and then lead the country themselves. ; Mao Zedong taught that people didn't really know what was good for them, but of course he did. He had some kind of metaphor that set up a body where he was the head, the goverment the arms, and the people the other parts. Or something like that. Basicly he wanted to be seen as God. ; In short, Maoism is a lame excuse for communism that Mao Zedong used to gain power and not Marxism at all.
