Curling
The ancient Scottish sport of curling has been called a hybrid of bowling and chess set on ice, but perhaps the closest analogy is shuffleboard. Two four-member teams slide 42-pound granite stones (the best of which come from a single quarry in Scotland) on a sheet of ice toward a target area. Teammates sweep the ice in front of the stone to help maneuver it towards the center target. ; Each player on the team throws two stones during an 'end,' which is sort of like an inning in baseball. The team with the most points after 8 or 10 ends wins the match. Did I mention that you can knock your opponents' stones out of contention? ; The name 'curling' comes from the Old English verb 'to curr,' or growl. There's a fair amount of shouting during the game, as team members urge each other on while sweeping the ice in front of the stone. ; This year, the British women's team gave their country its first Winter Olympics gold medal since 1984, while the Norwegian men's team upset the Canadian favorites.
