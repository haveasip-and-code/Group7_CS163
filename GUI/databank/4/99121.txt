drifting pretty
The Drifting Pretty Program is the premier drift training program for women in California. It was established in late 2003 by Nadine Toyoda. Toyoda and her former driving partner Yoshie Shuyama were the only women out at the United States' drift tracks in the 2002-2003 drifting season and saw the need for a program like this. ; In the past years, the drifting scene has grown tremendously, but only for men. For women on the other hand, there has not been a prominent woman drifter community recognized as they have in Japan. The Drifting Pretty Program has been changing that here in the states. In just one year, the amount of women driving at drifting events in Southern California has increased on average 400%.
