mase
a hell of a good rap artist. has a unique slow rap style. his childhood upbringing is unknown, so i will assume he grew up with the good life and simply rapped for fun, not for women, cars, jewels,etc... he admits that he has a respect for women, unlike fuckheads like 50 cent, chingy. he is hated for leaning into pop rather than rap. hes not the best, but is worth listening to.
