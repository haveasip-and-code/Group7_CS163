COCAINE
Cocaine is a drug derived from the leaves of the coca plant. It effects the release of dopamine in the brain, creating an intense euphoric high. Once the effects of the drug wear off, there is little dopamine left to be released and a state of depression occurs. Basically, you feel like shit. ; Cocaine, a.k.a. coke, blow, snow, nose candy, yayo - is usually snorted, but can also be smoked in a pipe (crack) or injected. Crack is a form of freebase cocaine and creates an even more intense high in the user. ; Effects of cocaine: increased body temp, increased heart rate, loss of appetite, insomnia, and paranioa. I have a tendency to look out windows and talk alot, but hey, thats just me HAHAH. Cocaine is without a doubt the greatest drug that has ever been created. I wanna say thank you to all you Columbians out there. I love you guys!!!! :-)
