Shock rock
A genre of music that is oriented to shock. Though it is becoming harder to shock people these days because we have 'seen it already'. Music is usually heavy metal ([Alice Cooper], [Ozzy Osbourne], [KISS]) or Industrial metal ([Rammstein], [Marilyn Manson]). But in the end its all just music. The performances were more meant to be shocking then the music itself.
