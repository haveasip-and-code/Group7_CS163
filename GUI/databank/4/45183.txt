Buffalo Grove
A town considered to be in the 'northwest suburbs' of Chicago. It is prodominantly Jewish. The better half of the town goes to Stevenson High School while the other half goes to Buffalo Grove High School. ; Everything in Buffalo Grove closes before 9 o'clock except for Buffalo's Ice Cream Parlor so this becomes the late night hang out. Also, the popo pull you over for going 1 mile over the speed limit and bust every party they possibly can. They try to dominish our hopes of escaping boredom by becoming raging alcoholics or potheads. ; High school students tend to go far away for college with high hopes that life isnt this boring everywhere.
