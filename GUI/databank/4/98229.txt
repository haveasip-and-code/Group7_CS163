Gambino
A NPC character on Gaia Online. He heads the infamous G Corp, and is currently in a heated battle with the Von Helson sisters (Two other NPCs), because they kidnapped his son, Gino Gambino. Gambino is a crazed man who has lost his sanity in the search for his son, and in that craze, he asked for donations from the Gaian users and built a giant tower. The tower itself was a monument to Gambino's power and lust for revenge, and so, when he was shot down by a mysterious cloaked figure, the tower fell down with him.
