scene lingo
Scene kids 'lingo' is made up of purposely typed typos. They overly-use words like 'rad' 'whoa' hxc''bijillion' etc. ; If your a computer geek like me, and hang out on forums, they are there. None of them speak like that in real life, but on the internet, they seem to have abbreviations for everything.
