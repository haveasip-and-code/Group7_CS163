Beast Mode
From the series Beast Wars. Reverting to Beast Mode was when either Predacons or Maximals transformed into their animals forms. In Beast Mode, they were usually able to move faster and transforming also sped up their internal repairs. Also, in the first season, reverting to Beast Mode protected them from Energon poisoning, which was what happened when they were exposed to too much raw energon.
