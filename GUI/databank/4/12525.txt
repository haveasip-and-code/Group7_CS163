Ronald Reagan
For some reason, this man is widely credited by the conservative media for ending the Cold War, and having the biggest economic boom. However, that is all a bunch of bullshit. Here is what the Gipper really did: shifted tax burden on the middle class by giving the rich ginormous tax cuts,invaded defenseless island nations like Grenada and invaded Lebanon in the interests of companies like Lockheed Martin and the Carlyle Group. Why did Ronnie invade Grenada? He answered 'you can't have eggnog without nutmeg' as to make his invasion a crusade for Christmas. Funded Osama Bin Laden, and Nicaraguan terrorists funded by weapon sales to Iran, and called them the 'moral equivalent of our founding fathers', traded weapons for hostages, gutted the environment, willfully ignored AIDS, and whose wife bilked the government to buy dresses costing more than the average American made in a year and got foreign policy advise from PYCHICS! THANK GOD HE IS DEAD! Had it only happened 25 years ago, then we wouldn't have the shit in the White House we have now!
