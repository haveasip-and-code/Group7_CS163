paved over
An acceptable way of saying 'pissed off.' (same acronym). Source: newspaper headline about residents in a small Vermont town that described people wanting to maintain their gravel road as being 'paved over' by the decision of the town road commission to pave the road when residents wanted gravel. The beauty is that it can be said anywhere.
