AZ
a.k.a. AZ the Visualiza ; Incredibly talented emcee. He has the illest flow in the game, hands down. His music is so fluid and smooth, and his rhymes are intelligent, but still street-wise He isn't about whores or the bling-bling. ; AZ is the best emcee to come out of Queens, IMO (yes, better than Nas). Made his first appearance on Nas' 'Life's a Bitch' off of the Illmatic album, and has worked with Nas alot. Every single hip-hop fan should own his album Doe or Die
