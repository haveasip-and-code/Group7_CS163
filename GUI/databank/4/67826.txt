Knock First
An emo/pop punk band located in the San Fernando Valley (Southern California). The name derives from when a teenager (most likely male) is masturbating and gets walked in on to be caught in the act; hence knock first. ; Changed their name to [Down For The Count] in 2003 due to a conflict with the name of an ABC show also called 'Knock First'.
