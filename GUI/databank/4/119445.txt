Former FedEx Employee
Any idiot who works for a package delivery company and leaves large boxes or expensive electronic equipement at a recipients home without getting a signature (on the doorstep or the like), then only to discover that the recipent called to complain that the delivery was never made, when in reality they kept the stuff without paying for it.. hence leaving the FedEx employee with some explaining to do.
