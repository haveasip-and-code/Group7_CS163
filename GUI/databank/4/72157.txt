bombastard
Bombastic: Grandiloquent, pompous speech or writing ; Bastard: (Slang) A person, especially one who is held to be mean or disagreeable. ; Those defs are from the dictionary, now combine them and you have a bombastard. ; If you want to see an example, go to any law school and listen for someone in the lounge/ library/ class that is throwing random latin phrases, improperly, into his/her speech. A bombastard is quick to point out any percieved flaw in anyone else's ideas, and believes him/herself to be perfect. Argues with professor, claiming the professor's interpretation of the article, which THAT PROFESSOR wrote, is wrong. Arrogant, annoying, wastes time pontificating.
