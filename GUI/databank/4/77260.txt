St. Vincent College
Small liberal arts college located in Latrobe, PA, about an hour from Pittsburgh. Despite some bogus ass policies and an administration with a knack for incompetency, misspending your $28K tuition on useless claptrap, SVC is a great place for starting a career; especially if that career is booze jockey. Don't mistake this college as one of discipline, even with a bunch of monks running around, because those rosy-cheeked clerics drink more than the student body combined. Hell, they used to have their own brewery before it burned down in the 60's. Give those crazy Bavarians a bottle of Heineken and they'll be your best friends for life (and death, since they'll be here when they die as St. Vincent is haunted out the bung). Even though we haven't had a football team in over 40 years, SVC is a bitchin' place to go and drink, meet some good people, and maybe learn a thing or two in between. Gotta love it!
