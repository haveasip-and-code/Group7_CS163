turning lane
The lane you turn in, which gives you a brief few seconds to show off to everyone your 84's, candy paint, or obnoxiously loud music or any other accessories you may have outside of your vehichle, or possibly inside if you have an invisible top. Or you may want to show off your invisible set and princess cut in the turning lane, who knows?
