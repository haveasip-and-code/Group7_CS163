cyberpimp
One who aspires to be a pimp, but can never be the real thing. He/she are frequently seen online at chat rooms/forums/personal ads/dating sites boasting how cool/'da bomb'/pimp-ish-alish they are. They are really a cybergeek or geekette and whould never qualify for true pimp-dom. They give the proper 'pimp' a bad name
