New Order
New Order is the best band from the 80s. They have many sweet albums that inclube Substance, Low Life, and Technique (my favorite). NO has way better music than the cRap we see nowadays on MTV. Heck MTV doesn't even play music videos b/c all the music today sucks? Or it just isn't as good as NO. Unfortunately, almost all of the population (USA) hasn't ever heard of New Order, but they have heard of 50 Cent. This makes me want to cry. ; -Best songs include: ; Bizarre Love Triangle ; True Faith ; Vanishing Point ; Blue Monday ; Perfect Kiss ; Mr Disco ; Sooner than you think ; Round & Round ; These are some of my favorites.
