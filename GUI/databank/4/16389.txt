long islander
a long islander has the best of both worlds--the greatest city in the world and some nice beaches all within 15-20 miles. the only people that resent long islanders are people who live in shitty areas of the city...people who wish they could afford a park avenue address...people who know they could never afford long island real estate. so basically, deal with it. classy areas of nyc don't want you and neither does long island.
