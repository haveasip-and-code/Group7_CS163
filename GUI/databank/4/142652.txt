dial-up
Slow medium for connecting to the Internet, which some people STILL use because: ; 1. They can't afford broadband (understandable, unlike the following) ; 2. They don't know about other ways to connect ; 3. They've been brainwashed into thinking AOL is number one ; 4. Don't have broadband in their area.
