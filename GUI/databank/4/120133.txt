Nationalist
Someone who has no concept of personal [identity] apart from how it relates to outdated ideas about [race] and [ethnicity], and believes that these factors are somehow crucial. Of course, the term 'race' is of little important genetic value, and pure races have existed either in history or prehistory, but don't tell them that. ; Despite the idiotic nature of these backwards beliefs, Nationalists can be quite intelligent and back up their views with erroneous facts to support them. These are [Darwinian] and/or Nietzscheian in flavor.
