peterprancer
A gnome-like individual, relatively furry, who prances about to obtain attention from others who normally ignore such ridiculous behaviour. Due to this person's inaptitude to participate in regular activities, such as playing frisby, he must make a fool of himself so others can laugh and point at his incompetence.
