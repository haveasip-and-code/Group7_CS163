valdese
small town near the geographical center of burke county in the foothills of north carolina, home to noob italian's that are too american to eat pasta, and one or two actual italian's. overrun by prejudice and dirty police officers that do whatever it takes to oppress the proliterians. popular spot for drunks, low budget potheads, some tweakers, and an assortment of crack/cokeheads, pillfreaks, acid trippers, and high school pseudo-drug-addicts hooked on keyboard cleaner and whipped cream. major production of ice in the surrounding mountain areas.
