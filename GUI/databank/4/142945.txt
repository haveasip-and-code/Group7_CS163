knights of the round table
The Elite few formly coined as the 'chump squad' now perfer to be known as what they are, The Knights of The Round Table. In order to clear up former aligations in defense of The Knights of The Round Table, we defend that our parties are not limited to one case and one case only, but infact they know no limits in any way shape or form. The Knights of the Round Table are, and will remain, The Elite Few. Those who deem Terror upon the name do so only because they fall short of what they strive for, supiriority.
