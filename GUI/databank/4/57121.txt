wannabe emo kid/trendy
Girls: Pose for pictures to put on their myspace account, downloads one Taking Back Sunday song and classes themselves as emo, their MSN names overcrowded with X's and dashes, eg: 'xxSlitWristTheoryxx.' Put stars all over their clothes and anything they own. Love the colour pink. Own one pair of converse. And maybe a pair of dickies. They ruin all decent music some how. ; The Guys: Pink shirts, belts, stars, slightly camp fashion sense. Shop at TopMan oftenly.Own a pair of pink converse, and model their hair based on either Tom Delonge or Dougie from McFly. ; My first bad experience of a wannabe emo/trendy...
