neopets general chat
1) The general [idiot] congregation place on Neopets. People here chatspeak and often try to get dates online. (It was deleted over a year ago. It has faded into legend... and now the stupid people are in all the other boards. EMS, I miss the days when I could visit (on an old tour bus, no less) and _not_ see 'ONG R U GAWF?!?11!?') ; 2) (another form of the word - Neopets GC'ers) One who goes to the Neopets General Chat. Some are chatspeaking lovesicks or child molesters.
