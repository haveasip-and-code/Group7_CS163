graduation
Can be either the greatest moment or the saddest. I thought it would be the greatest but looking back I would give up everything just for one day back in school. Crushes, unfairness, homework, love, friends, idiot teachers, recess, lunch, all that stuff. I miss it all. I find it strange to be looking back right now on this. But I guess the saying they say is true. 'You never knew how much fun being a kid really was until your older.'
