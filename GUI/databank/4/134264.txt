Cheesemousse
A large mythical creature that one goes hunting for in large groups while standing in a circle, slapping one's legs and clapping one's hands. If one finds a cheesemousse, the mere sight of the creatur will be so disturbing that the entire group will feel the need to run away screaming and deciding that [Snipe hunting] is a much better pastime. Mainly found and hunted for at Bement Camp and Conference Center.
