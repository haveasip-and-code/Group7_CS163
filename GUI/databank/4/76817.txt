lacubrious
Update: Evidently it is a made up word. From an interview with Variety - ; 'I have a friend who calls himself Dr.Lacubrious,' Mraz said. 'He's like, it means lazy, its another word for lackadaisical. We couldn't find it anywhere, and one day he left a message on my machine, and he's like, you won't find it in the dictionary because I made it up. And I thought it was very appropriate, because it is based on a friend of mine who's the king of one-liners, who'll say anything to get what he wants. And he's usually pretty smooth about it.'
