stickies
ok stickies r wut the plasma grenades r called if u have played xbox(live) for more than an hr....everyone calls them this, simply because in a battle saying plas-ma gren-ade....takes way too long, too many syllables...its much easier doing the stick-ies....way better.....they r by far the most entertaining, and effcient(besides sniping) way to kill opponents(or teammates) ; other associated words [plasma grenade] [large beautiful blue explosion of doom]
