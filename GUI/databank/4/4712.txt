Stallis
This is a term for the city of West Allis or Stalli-ville. Some identify it with White Trash Fest (Western Days at State Fair Park) while others with its infamous highway 100 where cruisers come from all over to pick up randoms. The rest of us define it was a way of life. We either want to stick it out to see what drama will be created or run away as far as possible.
