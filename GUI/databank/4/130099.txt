Madden 2006
A sad, sad excuse for 'the future of gaming.' In my opinion, the few weeks you spend saving up for the game, isn't worth the 2 hours you'll play it before it gets boring. The new Superstar Mode reaches a new level in stupidity, getting close to even the idea of invading Iraq for WMD. Superstar mode basically allows you to go to practice, take the occasional interview, and play games... nothing more.
