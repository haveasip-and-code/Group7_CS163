Case Western Reserve University
Case is not as bad as everyone says it is. Most of the people who have a problem with it are just those who are bitter about the fact that they couldn't get into one of their ivy league schools, and had to settle for Case. Most of the time, I tell people to stop complaining about Case, and if they really had the balls, they'd transfer to a university that has what they really want. ; Most of those who complain say that Case doesn't have enough of a party atmosphere. That's total bull. Case has a decent party scene, and if you're picking a school based on whether or not the party scene is high enough, then you have bigger problems. ; Now, I do understand that people pick schools for different reasons. But if you picked a school to go to because you want a calibar education, and you want to be pushed to your limit, then Case is the place. Most people who are here know what they want, and they want to learn and succeed, not take the time to party. ; The point is: if you want to study, and do nothing else, then come to Case. If you want a party, go to Kent. Another point: Case is not that bad as everyone says. The curriculum here is not anything short of what you'd expect to have at any Ivy-League. And, no, I'm not in the political sciences, or some area that requires me not to take the sciences. I'm a Biology/Pre-Med major, and the sciences and math here aren't as hard as what everyone says.
