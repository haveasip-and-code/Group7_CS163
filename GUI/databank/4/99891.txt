Chudes
A chav (somone who thinks they rule all humanity) crossed with a gumpus that thinks they're rude and hard. They're probably not. A female chude will probably be wearing heavy eyeliner, a scowl and carry a burbury handbag. A male will have a TN cap on, be standing outside shopping centres and shouting abuse. They usually hang in big packs. It's for protection, in case a REAL rude comes along and starts talking to them. This would scare them and they would run away and hide. If you or someone you love has been in contact with a chude, don't worry. They are losers.
