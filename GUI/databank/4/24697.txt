Vinyamar
Fortress-city in Beleriand, mentioned in Tolkien's work The Silmarillion. It was located in the [Falas] and was part of the realm of [Cirdan]. Like [Eglarest], it became a haven for elves fleeing after the [Nirnaeth Arnoediad], until it was successfully besieged and sacked by Morgoth's forces. Surviving elves fled to [Balar].
