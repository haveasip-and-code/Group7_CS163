Dwight Yoakam
Dwight Yoakam is one of the best artists in recent country music history. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he doesn't give in to what's trendy in Nashville and plays what he likes instead. As a result, his music is unique, honest, and never pretentious. He's able to mix elements of Bakersfield country, traditional country, bluegrass, blues, alt.country, rock, and more together seamlessly to create a sound that's both fresh and true to its roots. In addition to his unique musical style, he also writes some of the most emotional and thought-provoking (yet somehow still simplistic) lyrics. ; If that wasn't enough, he's also an acclaimed actor and director in Hollywood. What a guy.
