From the Midway boards
To be 'from the Midway boards' is to be unintelligent, or of a very young age (approx 10 years old). A popular phrase in the gaming community derived from ribbing members of a certain internet message board, renowned for being very young and/or quite dim. One does not actually have to have visted said website to be 'from the Midway boards,' as it is just a euphemism for acting childish, immature, or just generally stupid.
