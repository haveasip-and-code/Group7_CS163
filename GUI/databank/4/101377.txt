Phish
A 'jam band' that have tripped so much, smoked so much, and gotten wasted so much that they can never remember how their songs go. So they make it up as they go along! C'mon, people! They're not REALLY jamming, they just can't remember how the song went! That's why ever time they play it it's different.
