Ring Tax
The resultant of 'LORD' (see seperate definition) activity leading to the next mornings' 'Ring Damage' (see seperate definition). Denial of Ring Tax is frequently apparent in habitual LORD traders. Unlike 'Ring Damage', Ring Tax cannot be insured for & must be paid. Like personal Tax, Ring Tax is calculated on an annual basis. Ring Tax cannot however be offset against other personal or corporate tax. It can however be somewhat hidden in larger trading portfolios in cetain instances. This can lead to further LORD activities leading to renewed Ring Damage resultant in further Ring Tax.
