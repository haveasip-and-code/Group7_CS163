Krashnu
(pn) also 'Kraschnoo', An ubiquitous and omniscient deity whose being transcends the Sealab episodes to which it owes it's modern name. The many-appendages and protuberances of Krashnu can be said to represent at once all creatures, desires and sexual partialisms. One especially interesting aspect of the god is one of its many breasts which contains a dimension encompassing all breasts that ever were, will be, or have ever been imagined or represented.
