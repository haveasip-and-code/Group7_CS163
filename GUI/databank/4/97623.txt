This is a way of cheating at video games. Basically, the player backs up game files (usually savegame files) and then restores them after dying. The result is that the player never really dies and beats the game much more quickly, taking much of the fun out of the game. As far as I know, this originated in the rec.games.roguelike.nethack newsgroup.
