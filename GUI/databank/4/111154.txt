Rice Car
Any cheap car, especialy Asian, that has been 'upgraded' with after-market parts(exaust, body kits, nitrous, spoilers, speakers, lights, etc...)in an attempt to make it faster and/or 'pimpin'. ; In reality, instead of making a car better, 'ricing it up' makes it utterly and completly gay. Rice cars are easily beaten in races by American and European sports cars. Also, anyone who owns a rice car is looked down upon and seen as shameful by non-ricers. Rice cars are typically driven by young lower and middle class Asians, Hispanics, whiteboys and even some African Americans.
