No Cash
A gritty crust punk band from Nazareth, PA. Although included in the Lo-Cash family of music, the band was distinctively separate from the Crack Rock Steady Seven and did not originate from C-Squat. The band utlizied piercing, fast metal and punk riffs with a fast combination of screaming, clean vocals, and borderline rapping. Producing only one full length CD, 'Run Your Pockets', the band also did a 7' split with Team Spider, 'Summertime in the City.' Unfortunately the band has since broken up and little is known what proejcts (if any) the members are working on.
