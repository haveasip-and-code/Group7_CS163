CD Player
While harder to use, require more handling, and are more clunky, I prefer my CD Player. I bought an MP3 Player, and I enjoy CD's more. Then again, I buy albums and everything. Personally I enjoy hearing an album as an experience more than a singular song. So that's the real factor. If you like Albums, get a CD player, it comes with better sound quality. If you like hearing songs individually, buy an MP3 Player.
