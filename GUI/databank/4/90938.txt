Scorpio
Zodiac sign for people born between October 23 and November 22. Water sign, associated with sex (corresponds to genitals and bladder etc on the human body). Actually has three signs: scorpion, eagle, and serpent. According to astrology, Scorpios are introspective, reflective, mysterious, vengeful, calculating, possessive, intuitive, yadda yadda yadda. Pretty badass, as zodiac signs go.
