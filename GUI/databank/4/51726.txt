cheapquel
A low-budget 'sequel' to a hit motion picture or some other popular media extravaganza. Its sole purpose is to reap the benefits of cashing in on the aforementioned successful franchise by luring idiots into dishing out their money expecting quality at least on par with the original, only to find out it was a cheap marketing tool.
