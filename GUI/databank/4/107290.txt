DVD-9
A brand of DVDs famous for providing high quality DVDs yet at the same time are pirated copies. Can be found for $10-15 each per DVD (compared to say, $30 for a normal DVD) or much less ($4-5) if you shop in a place inhabitated mostly by Asians. ; Can be distinguished from other cheap copies by the elegance of its packaging and the phrase 'DVD-9' printed on the bottom right hand corner of the cover (if DVD-9 is on a sticker, it ain't real but check in the store's DVD player if you can to make sure).
