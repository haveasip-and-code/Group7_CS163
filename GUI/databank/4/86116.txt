straight-edge
Ideals invented by [Ian MacKaye]. Primarily focuses on maintaining a pure body and conscience by abstaining from drugs and alcohol. Promotes monogomous relationships (not mariage) and a vegetarian diet (although this is not essential). Ian MacKaye went so far as to shave his head but no one does this as a sign of their devotion anymore. Early straight-edgers could be identified by 'X's tattoed into their hands.
