I Drink  You Drink
Fairly self-explanatory drinking game. One person says 'I drink,' and takes a drink. They then say 'you drink' to the second player. The second player replies by saying 'I drink,' taking a drink, and returning the favour with a call of 'you drink.' The game continues until you're out of beer.
