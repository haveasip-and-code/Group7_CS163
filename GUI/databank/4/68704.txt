censorship
Well, I guess UrbanDicktionary isn't going to let me define PG anymore. They fucking removed a definition that had been up for a year. How about this: underage pussy doctor. You can't censor that. Who's underage? The doctor or the pussy? And what's underage? Under 40? Under 25? Assholes. You let half-literate douche bags define 'Punk'd' for fuck sakes. C'mon 'Punk'd?' At least fucking spell it right. I'm fucking out of here, c'mon Carl let's go eat fried chicken.
