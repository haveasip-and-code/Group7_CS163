DerrrUhhhh
A Combination of the word Duh, usually used to respond to a question that is blatently obvious,and Der a word usualy used in the state of michigan for someone saying something absolutly retarded..This word was originated by Chris A. and Kelly P. during a raging snow storm in January 2005...Since then the word has gone on to be one of the more popular slang terms in the town and from what i hear its pretty popular in asia too.
