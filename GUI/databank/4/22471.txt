may wee
This word, or two,mean yes and originates from the French term 'mais oui'and basically means yes said very enthusastically. This is used by us [genious] folk to show our fantastic language skills unlike those [wicca wicca blazin' squad] memebers or those involved in the [ponchomania] phenomina whose language skills are roughly nil. Anyway may i wish you much [elemayo] in the use of this new word.
