Plastic Gangster
A wannabe gangster, or as the 'Plas-Gang' in question might say, 'Gangsta!!' with unnecessary emphasis on the 'sta!!' part. Odd. And the sort of things that a Plastic gangster might get up to are; 1. Telling other people to do things. 2. Getting other people to fight for them. 3. Generally doing everything that real gangsters would do, but with less conviction and intent. And then, when they get in real situations, they always wuss out of the whole thing. Like if they could smash up a fence, they'd be like, nope, sorry. Gotta go home for a bath. or...something.
