anti-choice
A more accurate title for someone who claims to be 'pro-life'. ; One who believes the fate of an unborn fetus is more important than a woman's life. ; One who thinks people should not be able to make choices about their own bodies and lives, but thinks the government should control this matter. ; Ironically, they are usually also Republicans, a party that's supposed to be against government-controlled things. They also usually favor the death penalty, oppose education funds - basically they only care about children until they are born. They have been known to create organizations that try to convince/force women to keep pregnancies until birth, and once the child is born they kick them out and forget about them. ; Anti-choicers also usually oppose contraceptives, birth control and realistic sex education, despite the fact that they prevent countless unwanted pregnancies. ; More extreme anti-choice individuals picket at women's health clinics, often trying to physically prevent patients from entering, bombing women's health clinics, murdering doctors, harassing and stalking clinic employees, etc.
