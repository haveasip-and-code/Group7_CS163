mhotiang (MO-TANG)
Its alot like a rat tail but on your forehead. There are many different types of Mhotiang's, Like the superman, or the beaded mhotiang, and the dreaded mhotiang. It was basically birthed in the eighties, but now it is making its Mhotiang comeback. Its a great piece of flair to add to a flattop/mullet.
