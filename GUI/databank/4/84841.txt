US Constitution
1) An obsolete document printed in the 1700's on hemp paper, establishing a new democracy and forming the basis for our current government. Well written piece but the Homeland Security Act has rendered it ineffective for protecting US citizens from illegal searches and seizures by our own police and military, under the guise of terrorist hunting.
