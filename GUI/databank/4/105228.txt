Mattapan
Neighborhood of Boston. Over 80% of the population is black. 12.2% are hispanic. Less than 5% are white. 22.3% of the population lives in poverty. Referred to as 'Murderpan', due to the number of murders that have occured since all the Jews moved out, and all the blacks moved in. A handful get murdered here each year. But the 1980s there was like a new one every few days. If only Boston's founders could see what this area has become, now that would be funny.
