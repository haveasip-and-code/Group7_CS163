moon pie
moon pie is an actual product! it is a chocolate, marshmallow and grahan cracker (smore like!) confection/junk food snack pie, round in shape. exclusively seen/eaten in the south. they are commonly sold at gas stations and truck stops and as such has a rep as a white-trash product. i have seen one, but never eaten one. paired with a drink to 'wash it down' which i THINK is usually milk. some of you southern red necks need help me put here.
