An MMORPG game where many people either love it, or play a month then decides it WAY to repetitive. All one does is click to kill monsters, to get cash, which you buy more armor, so one can click on more creatures! Hey if they add any more interesting things to this game, it might be better. However, it is currently free (still in beta I've heard) But if it is in Beta its still quite good. Webzen (creator of the game) once said the game is still 20% done, can't wait till the next 80%.
