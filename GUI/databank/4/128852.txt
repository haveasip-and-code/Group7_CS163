tan trash
A drug addict whose skin is tan for one of the following reasons: ; 1.) The meth they are on makes them think they are ugly (which is pry true) so they go tan ; 2.) They are on a meth binge and have gotten sunburnt from walking along the highway in the heat for 8 days ; 3.) Their skin is so wrinkly you can't tell what color it is, so it automatically becomes tan.
