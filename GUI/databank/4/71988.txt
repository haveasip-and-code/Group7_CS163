819
A numeric symbol representing the life of T-Dub, a legend among men. Derived from the word big, 819 was accidentally created by a young mexican named [A-Train] who was vandalizing his friends' bedroom. He was trying to write BIG T on the wall therby giving T-Dub the props he deserved, but instead he wrote 819, because of his poor grammer and drunken state. T-Dub used 819 as his trademark party animal name for a few years after its initial discovery. 819 has risen to everlasting greatness since the passing of the great T-Dub in May 2002.
