Saturday
The BEST day of the week! Most people seem to like Friday. Now, think about it. People like Friday because it's the day before the weekend. However, what if it was Friday everyday? Doesn't seem like much, huh? ; On the other hand, Saturday is the best because the whole day is free and you don't have to worry about anything the next day like Sunday, so you can stay up all night.
