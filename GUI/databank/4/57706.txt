no skunk
Came about somewhere in New Jersey(I remember it from grade school in Passaic 1998ish, where if one kid says something stupid or gives wrong information, his friends(or simply someone near) declare 'no skunk' then proceed to slide their finger across his neck to inflict pain. It has alot of other things involved with it, like when you say 'no skunk' the soon-to-be victim can say 'softies' and you have to do it softly, or if you say 'hardies' you get to do it harder than usual. ; See also: [medong]
