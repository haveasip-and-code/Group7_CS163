krikkit
A planet with a single sun located inside a giant dust cloud on the utmost eastern edge of the galexy. because of the dust could there had never been anything to see in the sky, and night was totally blank. On the first trip into space in a spaceship built in someones backyard in almost exactly a year after discovering that there was such a thing as space, the masters of krikkit flew out of the dust cloud and saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite dust and their minds sang with fear. For a while they flew on motionless against the sweep of the Universe, turned around and said 'it'll have to go'. ; The Krikkit attack on the galexy had been stunning. Thousands and thousands of huge krikkit warships had leaped suddenly out of hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building the next wave and then calmly zaspping those worlds out of existence. ; It took the entire galexy approximatly two thousand years and two grillon guys, before Zipo Bebrok 5x10^8 suggested that the planet of krikkit was to be encased for perpetuity in an envelope of Slo-Time, inside which life would continue almost infinitely slowly, untill the rest of the udiverse came to its final end.
