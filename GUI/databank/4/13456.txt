Padua girl
Pada-hoe ; you know the saying 'padua to bed ursaline to wed' well i have a theory on that. see padua is the all girls school and ursaline is the school where boys with make-up eventuly become women. thats why it cost so much to go there, the gender-reasigning process is expensive, and that also explains why they are soo good at sports, i'm sure we've all thought 'pants check' when watching the UA teams...
