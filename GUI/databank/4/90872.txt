tomcats
three crazy drunken f*ckers who get all the attention at the neighborhood bar, all of whom must work at dunkin donuts and claim to own everywhere they go. they also must periodically go behind the bar to crush cans and be accused of snorting coke in bathroom; however, are envied and hated by cokewhores
