ned flanders
An extremely God-fearing man, with creepy little kids named Rodd and Todd. Used to have a wife named Maude, but she was hit by a barrage of t-shirts shot from bazookas at a NASCAR race, causing her to fall off the bleachers. Has an extremely ripped chest, and had a relationship with Sar Sloane, the biggest hoe in Hollywood (in the Simpsons anyway). Also a huge [Beatles] fan.
