brewing
A method of smoking hashish. Performed by breaking or 'bodding' the hash into little bits of hash or 'bods' and picking up these bods with a cigarette. Then the cigarette with the burning bod on it is inserted usually into an empty water bottle through a hole made on the side near the bottom by the lighter. The cigarette is left in the bottle until the bod on the cigarette stops streaming smoke and turnes burning orange. The cap is then unscrewed, a bit of smoke is let out(usually 1-2 seconds), because the smoke at the top will be 99% cigarette smoke, and the rest of the smoke is quickly inhaled and held in for a personally prefered amount of time.
