Tits McFree
noun: denoting a female wearing a top so low-cut that one or both of her mammary glands has broken free of their terrestrial limitations (i.e. one of her tits has popped out of her shirt because she's got so much cleavage). Especially appropriate when the top in question is green, recalling an Irish vibe, ergo the 'Mc' in 'Tits McFree.' Term is a play on the classic denotation 'Tits McGee,' which is typically considered to refer to a merely well endowed female regardless of whether one of her endowments is currently under public exhibition.
