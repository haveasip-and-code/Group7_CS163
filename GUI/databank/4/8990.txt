dictionary polluter
1. n. one who puts stupid ass definitions on Urbandictionary.com about people they know personally from their school. ; Listen up, kiddies: its not cool - and it never will be - to write about how (hot, athletic, sexy, ugly, stupid, mean) you think (name) from (location) is. ; Your pal won't think you're much cooler, you're enemy will only laugh at you more because of your pathetic cyber-nerd venting methods and your date won't think your confession of true love on the internet is original. In fact, they'll probably think you're an [assclown].
