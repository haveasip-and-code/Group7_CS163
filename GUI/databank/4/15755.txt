A 12 step program for those who wish to stop drinking and get sober and stay sober. It is not run by anybody but is a democratic group of fellow drunks. It is not religious, but there is a spiritual aspect to the program for those who want it. It's a great program where its members often find lasting deep friendships with other sober folks. It works!
