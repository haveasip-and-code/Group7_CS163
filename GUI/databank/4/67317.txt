princess
The sort of girl who has never had to work for a single thing in her life. She is usually sheltered to the point where it's ridiculous, and spoiled beyond belief. She has trouble accepting that there's anything wrong in the world and can hardly believe that there are people who don't have an American Express Platinum or a heated swimming pool. She's often gregarious, or, in some occasions, very much a bitch. There's one constant, however. She'll invariably be spoiled or somewhat snotty.
