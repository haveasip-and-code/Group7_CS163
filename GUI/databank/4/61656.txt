dumb ricer
to modify your late model honda accord in such a way that it will look remotely like a nissan skyline, fags think that making a skyline is a substitute for the real thing. adding fake rim wheel covers is also denoted as being a dumb ricer. Same goes for driving an automatic like a standard, putting the car into neutral at a red light and revving the engine, you only look more like fake rice poseur.
