kickboxing
A lot of Americans will tell you that their country is solely responsible for kickboxing. But... While they had a big part in the development of it. It is originally derived from a combination of [boxing], an English/European sport/method of fighting, and [muay thai] or [thai boxing], another combat sport, but invented by the Thai people. ; Kicboxing blends the kicking techniques (and knees and elbows if you're taught for street fighting too) of Muay Thai, with the more conventional punching and footwork techniques of western boxing. ; All in all. It is the most popular 'hybrid' as some people would call it, in the world. It is lots of fun, a good way to get some decent fitness, and a good skill to have.
