mactel
This term refers to the upcoming Apple Macintosh systems with x86 Intel processors. Apparently, (Apple/IBM/Motorola) is going to halt the production of PowerPC processors, so Apple is switching to Intel. Or maybe this is just another ploy to get PC users to switch to the Mac platform. The world may never know.
