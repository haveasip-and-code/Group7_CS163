Fanny Mangler
A small contraption with little spinning prongs. Discovered by Cook in 1842, used to reduce pleasure in aboriginal women, and cause intense pain, and prolonged contractions, leading to a more substantial orgasm for the male, in order to stimulate release of sperm. Hencefourth, increasing fertility of the males and raising the chances of creating a larger litter.
