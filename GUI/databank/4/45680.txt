rut
To round a number to an absurdly low number of significant figures for seemingly no reason. This term is derived from the name of the author of several High School physics textbooks in New Zealand; Chris Rutter, who seems to have rounded numbers up, down or sideways depending on the mood that he was in while writing the answers sections of the textbooks.
