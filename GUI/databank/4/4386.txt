the Cup and Sniff
when one loves the smell of their farts yet doesn't want (or is too lazy) to fart and then lean over to smell the area that they farted in. Instead, they can make a cup out of their hand and fart into it, close the 'cup', and bring it to their nose, where they can open it and sniff.
