scene kids
'unfortunate, tortured youth,' often complain about their [teen angst] with not much consideration for anyone with any real-world issues or other people in general. '[Scene kid]' often coincides with wearing obscure band t-shirts (even if they've never heard them), dying and cutting one's hair more than once ever 2 weeks or so, playing in some obscure band that usually sucks (with an extremely random name), and wearing 'outlandish' clothing to get attention. Often threaten to do stupid things for small amounts of money but really have no balls at all and are all talk. Usually fortunate suburban kids who feel they have something to express by going to 'shows' and jumping on each other and making people feel less scene than they (calling others, ironically enough,'[poseurs]'), scene kids tend to hang out at the mall (probably near but not too near a hot topic), they're the kids wearing the [Taking Back Sunday] t-shirt to the TBS show, and they most definitely claim to have heard them first and might even know them personally, because it matters oh so much (!?). most scene kids probably don't really know who they are because they've spent so much time following the crowd of myspace users and spend more time trying to figure out if [Warped Tour] is still cool and taking pictures of themselves from angles than they have on job applications or learning anything relevant to 'real life.'
