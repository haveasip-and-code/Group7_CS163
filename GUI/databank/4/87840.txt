crapbunnies
A word that was mistakenly created during a 'funny word' conversation (i.e. Spoon is a funny word). The first person had said, 'crap' and the second had said, 'bunnies'. Then, crapbunnies was created. ; Since its creation, it has been used as a replacement for an explitive (i.e. shit) for the most part. However, it can still be used as an explanation of small round pieces of shit (that look like rabbit droppings). Or, feel free to create your own definition.
