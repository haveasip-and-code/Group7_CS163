livestrong
What began as an awesome idea to support the Lance Armstrong Foundation for Cancer, the word Livestrong can be found on yellow rubber bracelets that just about everyone seems to be wearing. Since it's creation, other foundations for just about everything have ripped off the idea and made braclets of their own, except sell them for way more than just $1.
