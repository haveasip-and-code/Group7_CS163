The Sprinkler
A dance that utilizes multiple parts of your body. You take your left or right hand and put it on the back of you head with your elbow sticking out on the side. Then take your other arm, stick it straight out and move it up and down. Oscillate your entire body quickly. This is The Sprinkler. Very funny, fun, and amusing to watch or do, especially when chanting, 'Do the sprinkler, do the sprinkler...'
