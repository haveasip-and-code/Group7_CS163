Cherry Hill  NJ
A big suburb only seen by non-Cherry Hillers while driving through to get to Philly. A numerous amount of Jews can be seen walking to and from the JCC in their yamacas or driving their mercedes around. The East Side and the West Side have their differences, but, objectively, they are all the same: rich, white kids with dumbass rich parents, and who feel the need to pretend they're black. If your are thinking about moving to Cherry Hill, don't. If you already live in Cherry Hill, sucks for you. For all those who have no idea what Cherry Hill is, lucky bitches.
