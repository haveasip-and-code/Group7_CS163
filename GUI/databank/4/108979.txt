joe pesci
An actor with a career starting in 1961 with an uncredited appearance as a dancer in Hey Lets Twist (1961). Now 34 films under his belt including Raging Bull (1980), The Super & JFK (1991) and.. um, the Home Alone series. Not a bright moment I'd say. But, I guess he's the rich famous guy and I'm the one sitting here writing a definition of him, so who am I to say....?
