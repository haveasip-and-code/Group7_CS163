too cool for school
The ock in your typical local community college class who resists (in the classroom) expressing himself or liberally speaking to people unless called on. He is typically sleepy-eyed with perma-frown/stance and at any and every alloted break, this guy will jump on the cell phone and become a totally different person. see also total dick and indistinguishable.
