blue sky mining
The practice of completely stripping a region bare of all natural resources without regard to sustainability, such as clearfelling a rainforest, intensive cultivation without fertilizing, or open-cast strip-mining a mountain range. This phrase was also used by 80s rock band Midnight Oil as the name of a popular song.
