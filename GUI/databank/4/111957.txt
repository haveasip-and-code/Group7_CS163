songmeanings.net
A site that used to be alright as it gave a type of open forum for people to discuss the lyrics of the song and what it meant. ; Then people just used the space to give ill formed and ignorant opinions of songs and bands and just turn the site into a 'I hate this band because <reason>... however, listen to me while I shove even more reasons why you should like this other band down your throat! HEre's some cool... art house rock! Yeh man, we're hip... but NOT HIP! Dangerous'.... but I digress. ; It's basically a musical lyrics version of Urban Dictionary, in what it's supposed to be and what it became.
