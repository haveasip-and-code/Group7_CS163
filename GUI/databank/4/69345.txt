rock climbing
Of all so-called '[extreme sports]' (activities that about 1/2 the time are undertaken, or claimed to have been undertaken, by otherwise boring people in a desperate attempt to become interesting), this is probably the trendiest way to give yourself the affectation of ruggedness, danger, physical fitness, etc. Note that most people who express an interest in rock-climbing or purchase incidental gear such as carabiners, have never climbed and never will. ; See also: [posers], [conformity of noncomformity], [North Face], [bungee jumping].
