back to mine
A series of mix compilation cd's by well respected dj's and electronic dance music artists such as Faithless and Nick Warren. The artists select songs outside of their normal genre and usually put together a nice relaxing mix. Back to Mine cd's are perfect for listening to either while in the bedroom or after coming home at 6 am or later to mellow out to. They are very chilled out mixes and are not for dancing.
