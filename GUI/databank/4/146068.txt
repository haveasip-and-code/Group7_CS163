When your feeling pissed off because nothing is going your way, when you see the girl you fancy in the arms of another man, when you feel as if all the luck in the world is against you, when your breathing to live and nothing else your feeling 36degrees the. originally derived from the placebo song '36 degrees'. can be enhanced to 'when silver turns to blue im thirty six degrees under without you.' in a word when your pissed off cause your gf got laid with another guy.
