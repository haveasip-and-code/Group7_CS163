LOK
Abbreviation of 'lol ok' in a whole series of words from, lok through to roflmfaok (rolling on the floor laughing my fucking arse off ok). All inbetweens are also in use, lmaok etc. Why? Thanks to me, Dan (a.k.a. AktiveDesign) I invented this wonderful string of words and now the world owes me big time...
