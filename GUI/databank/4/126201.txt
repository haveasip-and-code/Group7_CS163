New Monkey
A type of hardcore rave music, which is led by an MC (Master Of Ceremonies.) This all-encompassing genre uses trance and dance with MC'd vocals to make it what it is. This type of music is a favourite in South American and African dance-halls, replacing the techno/house style with a more ethnic sound including various bass instruments.
