cockeysville middle school
a jail...a school in cockeysville MD with no windows and ugly lockers. we are a mix of ghetto, white trash and rich snobs... and then the people that aren't afraid to be themselves.even though our school is ugly, we will go to dulaney and have a life... unlike some other schools in MD who aren't as fortunate.
