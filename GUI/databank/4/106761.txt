Krebs Cycle
An enzyme mediated pathway that reduces the electron transporting coenzymes FAD+ and NAD+. The reduced forms of these molecules, NADH and FADH2 provide the electrons that power oxidative phosphorylation, the most efficient step in aerobic respiration. ; Additionally, the Krebs cycle synthesizes ATP through substrate level phosphorlylation. ; It was named for its discoverer, Hans Krebs.
