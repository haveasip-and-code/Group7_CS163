Feminism
Feminism is the movement of women that attempts to break down the barriers of gender inequality. It is thought to have began in the late 19th century with the womens campaign for the vote. It began to pick up steam in the again in the sixties with the arival of the pill but began to fizzle out in the 90s. ; It is now largely regarded (particularly by ignorant skinheaded men) as obselete. 'Ya vote, ya work, Wha' ya monin' 'bout ya freaky lesbo' is the general thought among this crowd. ; True women can vote but that is hardly the surface of gender inequality. Women CAN work but are also expected to look after the kids and do the housework. Equal? I don't think so. Women are also statistically paid less for doing the same jobs as men and hold relatively few high powered jobs compared to men. ; Sure women have made progress but there are still major inequalties in society that need to be solved. ; 'Why do I care?' I hear those of you who are male say. Well, you have mothers, sisters, wives etc. Wouldnt you be furious if they were disadvantaged because they were black or gay or disabled? Of course you would! So why is it ok for this to happen to your family because they are women? ; You do not have to hate men or burn bras or be a lesbian to be a feminist. You just have to believe in equality. ; Feminists (including men) kick ass!
