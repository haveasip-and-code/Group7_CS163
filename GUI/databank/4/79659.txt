The Passion of the Christ
A movie about a guy who doesn't and never did exist getting beat by jews for about 2 and a half hours and forced to carry a wooden cross that he would soon be nailed to and die on it. Was a cool movie except they should have had someone like Adam Sandler beating this fuck or atleast Tom Green. Would have made the movie about 10 million more dollars.
