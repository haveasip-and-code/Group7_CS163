Cincinnati Urban
One of the rarely-listed accents/regional dialects in linguistic studies. This big city accent is basically the lower-Midwestern nasal twang typical of southern Ohio, Indiana, and north/northwestern Kentucky mixed with a lot of northern Chicago/Cleveland influence. Locals will usually pronounce 'a's' like 'e's'. For example, a Greater Cincinnati Area local would say 'cless' instead of 'class'. In addition, locals will also say words that are characteristic of the Upper Midwest, such as 'pop' and 'you guys'.
