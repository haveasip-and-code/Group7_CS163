melodica
A sub-genre of electronica music that makes heavy use of melody. The melodies in this kind of music are usually very complex. Whereas trance music might play the same couple bars of music like 36 times in a row, melodica music doesn't tend to repeat itself. Generally, melodica does not have lyrics.
