Austin  TX
The capital city of Texas, where Longhorns, hippies, yuppies, scenesters, frat boys, sorority girls, rednecks, WASPS, and transvestites all live together peacefully. The most liberal, liveable, and fun city in Texas, or anywhere. Popular for being the live music capital of the world and home to the coolest university.
