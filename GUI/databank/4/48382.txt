paisa
A Mexican living in the United States that wears cowboy hats, belts and Boots made of Ostrich skin. Also Rayon shirts, unbuttoned at the top so that the chest ( usually hairy ) can be exposed to show off a cheap gold chain adorned with a symbol of the [Virgin de Guadalupe]. This person will speak very little English; preferring to speak in Spanish and use the phrase, [mamasita] or [mija] when trying to attract the attention of a [piruja] or [hoodrat].
