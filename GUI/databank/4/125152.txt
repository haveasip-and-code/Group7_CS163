new Jersey
The best state ever. Contains seedy bars, diners, and hoboken people with ridiculous accents. Awesome comic book stores, the place to be. Other states may make fun of us Jersy-ites but thats only because they know we're the coolest. Plus we got Jay and Silent Bob and Seaside Heights so i fart in your general direction if u think it's less that the shit.
