Guy code
The honor and respect all guys should show to their friends. Even if they are only slightly friends with this guy. You can never talk to, hang out with or do anything nice for my girl unless it is first approved by me. [Never rub another man's rhubarb!] Furthermore, you cannot change your relationship with her if we ever break up. Ending the friendship along with castration is the prefered punishment for breaking any of these rules.
