free software
Free software does NOT mean that you do not have to pay to get it. Free software is a matter of freedom, not price. In order for software to be free, users must be able to run, copy, distribute (with a fee or without a fee), study, change and improve the software. ; Do not confuse free software with open source software. Although they are very similar, the philosophy behind them is different. Free software is about ethics and open source software is about being practical.
