butt sneeze
a.k.a. sneeze-butt, ass-sneeze, asschoo ; A butt-sneeze is a semi-mythical phenomenon that involves a rapid expulsion of air and liquid from the rectum. The 'sneeze' is often mistaken for flatulence due to it's sound and pungent odor. ; Despite it's rare occurance, controversy has erupted about whether it is necessary to say 'bless you' after a butt-sneeze, as one generally does after a regular Sneeze. ; The late Father Y. A. Nire had the following words on this matter: ; 'In the past, it was believed that the soul escaped the body when a person sneezed. So, by saying 'bless you', the soul was returned to the body. Religion tells us that sinful/harmful substances leave the anus - for example: excrement. However, divine things enter the anus - Such as, my penis into a supermodel. Since the soul is considered divine, it is unlikely to travel out of the anus. Therefore, one does not need to say 'bless you'.
