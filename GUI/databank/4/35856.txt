M.W.S.
Short for 'Multiple Weapon System'. Developed by Miyuki for [Shion] to use inside the Encephalon against enemies. Later created a model for real-life use while Shion was on the Woglinde. Modified after Shion landed on Second Miltia into a more portable version capable of long-range Ether attacks.
