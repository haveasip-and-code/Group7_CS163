Cunt Rock
1. Music which may considered a reaction to Cock Rock (which celebrates loose sex, drugs and machismo) in which women whine about relationships, celebrate monogamy, talk about recovery, and portray men as sexist and abusive. 2. Music in which women reveal their own version sexism against men in general. Example of such work can be found in the music associated with the Lithe Fair Musicians: Sara Sarah McLachlan, Joan Osborne, Jewel, and the Indigo Girls. The tradition is being continue by such artist as Avril levene, Kelly Clark and Hillary Duff.
