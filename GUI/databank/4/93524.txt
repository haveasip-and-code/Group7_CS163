rza
10th chamber doesnt know what hes talking about either. rza IS the leader of the wu tang clan. gza taught rza about the 5% nation, but rza and the ODB were the first to really bring in the wu-tang and shaolin. all they would do is watch kung fu movies all night. brush up on your history b/c its disgustingly wrong.
