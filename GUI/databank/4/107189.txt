shitties
Shitties, (also [Shi'ite], etc.) Coined by Sir David 'Brown' Brunton in 2005, was originally a term to describe those, who at social or [hudge] gatherings were acting over dramatic, stupid, and in the end just plain shitty. ; 'Shittie' was then adapted to rule out those who were not wanted/welcome at those future events. Of course, with all new slang, and the help of the internet, those with low self esteem felt that they were targeted by those non-shitties. ; The rule of 'Shittie' is as follows: ; -If you have to ask yourself if you're a shittie, then you are.
