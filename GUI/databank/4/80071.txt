mannequinism
an epidemic where a citizen plays no key role in the economic or social contrasts of our world, such as closing oneself in a dark box, or having too much in hand hence having no time for volunteer work, or any participation in a community, in turn, this leads to the person literally turning into a mannequin; a subtle, crippled figure immune to the active world around it.
