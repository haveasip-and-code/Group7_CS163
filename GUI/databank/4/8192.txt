dew
At night when all the world is sleeping, fairies and pizies come out to play (see[thumbalina]); they can't use toilets.. because I mean, who has out door toilets small enough for a fairie to use?.. anyways, they miniture peterpan lovers take a leak on your lawn. Then you go outside and walk on it, you sick fuck!
