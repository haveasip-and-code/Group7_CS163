Where I live. Very good school (something like a 99.9% college acceptance rating). although I must say that there are a lot of preppy kids here. Also the birthplace of genetics (where DNA was first discovered by watson and crick). Located on Long Island, NY right on the border of Suffolk and Nassau county, but I think it's considered to be in Suffolk county.
