st. anger
Probably Metallica's worst album. Being such a hardcore fan of the band I at least would like to say there are some okayish songs on the album, Some Kind of Monster probably being the best. Even when Metallica changed their style with Load and ReLoad they were still a kickass band, but their latest album was very poor to Metallica standards because they tried experimenting with nu-metal music. I don't believe Lars is the downfall though, I mean his drumming in St. Anger sounds pretty much the same in all the songs but all the songs sound the same anyways. It would make sense if they had recorded all the songs, one after another without really changing the guitar FX or drums, but it took them three years, but seeing the DVD named 'Some Kind of Monster' you can sort of see what problems they had making this album.
