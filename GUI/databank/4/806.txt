Best Friend
Best Friends are very special people in your life. They are the first people you think about when you make plans. They are the first people you go to when you need someone to talk to. You will phone them up just to talk about nothing, or the most important things in your life. When you're sad they will try their hardest to cheer you up. They give the best hugs in the world! They are the shoulder to cry on, because you know that they truly care about you. In most cases they would take a bullet for you, coz it would be too painful to watch you get hurt. ; 2 Girl best friends: They do all the girly things together, no one says anything. ; 2 Boy best friends: They do all the boy stuff together, no one says anything. ; 1 Boy + 1 Girl best friends: They do boy and girl stuff, People says lots of stuff
