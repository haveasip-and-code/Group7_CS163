acceleraphobia
Your definition is of acceleration is wrong. People do legitimately have a fear of acceleration, but such people have no fear of speed. It's simply the rate at which one arrives at that speed that causes discomfort. Therefore, someone with a fear of acceleration can quite comfortably travel at 70 mph on a motorway, but they're not going to floor the accelerator in first gear, because that's just stupid and only morons drive like that.
