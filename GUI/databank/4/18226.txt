Kino
One of the greatest bands in Russian history. Kino consisted of Yuri Kasparyan, Igor Tikhomerov, Georgij Gurianov, and legendary vocalist Viktor Tsoy. Kino did many songs that are still famous in Russia today, such as 'Kukushka' (Cuckoo) and 'Deti prokhodnykh Dvorov' (Children from the Crossing Yards). Sadly, Kino does not exist anymore, since Viktor Tsoy was killed in a car accident in 1990.
