apostophe
The most butchered punctuation mark in the English language. Apostrophes are used ; 1) to ; indicate contractions, ; 2) to indicate possession (in some cases), and ; 3) VERY occasionally to denote a plural (where otherwise the meaning of the sentence would be unclear). ; The use of an apostrophe in the contraction 'it's', (which means 'it is'), but not in 'its', (which is a possessive) causes problems for many people who didn't pass third grade.
