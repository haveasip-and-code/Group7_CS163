BOOYAH
Booyah is a modern day version of an 18th century mid-west lightening rod that is traditionally placed on the peaks of structures such as a house or barn. ; The difference between 18th century lightening rods and the modern day BOOYAH is that the old lightning rods have one glass ball. BOOYAHS have one to three translucent glass balls of different colors. Depending on the colors selected, a BOOYAH brings to the house and its inhabitants different positive energy sources such as courage, energy, peace and harmony.
