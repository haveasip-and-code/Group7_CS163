Phantom Of The opera
An overblown, overhyped, overscored musical adaptation of Gaston Leroux' 1911 novel. Music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, who has ripped his tunes and style from Puccini and then beat them into the ground with an enormous sledgehammer. ; Reduces the original novel, a satirical Gothic pastiche, to a simplified would-be meaningful, actually-is crap melodrama. ; Includes such pathetic lyrics as rhyming 'succumb to me' with 'succumb to me,' completely eviscerates the character of Raoul, and makes the 19th-century operatic genius the Phantom sound like a 1980s rock star.
