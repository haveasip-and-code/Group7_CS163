Infantry
On the eight day, God created Infantry. He sayeth 'let there be a game fit for Man, who was created in my image, and for me when I am bored' and thusly Infantry rose from the sea of binary code, a testament to divine power and the coolness of developer Harmless Games. But Man became sinful and an asshole (no surprise there), and God decided to destroy what he created. 'Man has gone wrong,' God said, 'and I shall destroy these sinful men and bring about the ruination of their great game.' And verily, He flooded the earth for 40 days and 40 nights, and made HG sell Infantry to Sonly Online Entertainment who promptly ruined it on divine order (not that they needed any help though). ; Luckily for mankind Noah was allowed to build an ark and save his family and the animals, but God was swift and merciless with Infantry. After SOE completed its task, what remained of the once mighty game was set upon by all manner of demons, hackers, script kiddies, and nade lamers. And when the dust settled, Infantry was leveled, laid low by the hand that rent Sodom and Gomorrah, then banished to the underworld to be lorded over by Satan's assistant Joe for all of eternity.
