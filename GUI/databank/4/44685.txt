mum truck
Also called [Chelsea Tractor] [4 by 4] [SUV]. An obese squarish collection of green house gases on wheels rich idiot mothers use but darent ever take off road for fear they will smudge their tested on animals make up. A typical mum truck is about 10 meters tall, takes up all available lanes and as much of the car park as mum thinks she's rich enough to deserve. it has enough room in it for about 20 normal people but usually contains just fat little Reginald and Emelia on their way to independant schools.
