Mad Dog
The common name for a rabid female creature that lives in the hills of Orinda, Ca and drives a small, blue Honda. This creature preys on the lives and feelings of high school aged public speakers, which she enjoys covered in fermented salad dressing and stinking shrimp. She is extremely dangerous and may be identified by the overuse of the words \'accurate\' (pronounced akrit) and \'enunciate,\' the misuse of the phrase \'in other words,\' or by the repetitive scratching of a large mole on the back of her neck. Methods of attack include giving the evil eye, talking about her grandchildren or her 5 marriages, or petitioning the board of the NFL. Take caution as she has been known to wear sundresses that cause blindness unless eye protection is worn. ; Also known as \'Ecrats the Ogre\' and \'the devil incarnate.\'
