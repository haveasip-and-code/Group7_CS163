UTA
University of Texas at Arlington.(or ; U T Almost) A medium sized campus in the UT system. It has a cannon and a football stadium named after a professor who still teaches here. But.....It has no football team to blow the cannon for or for the cheerleaders to cheer for and, alas, the stadium is empty.
