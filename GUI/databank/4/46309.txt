clusterfuck
Marine slang -- A clusterfuck was any group of Marines big enough to draw enemy fire, or several Marines close enough together to be wounded by the same incoming round. More generically, a clusterfuck was something that was all screwed up. Whenever three or more CAP Marines gathered in the open, talking or working on something, somebody was sure to call out 'clusterfuck!' and one or more guys would walk away.
