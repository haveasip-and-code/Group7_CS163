Mega Man
A blue robot who was created by a doctor of science named Dr. Light. He was orginally not bulit for combat, instead he was created to be a house robot, sort of like Roll. His designs for the armor came from Blues' (Proto Man). Has a transforming dog called rush, a cat that name escapes me, and is one of the coolest robots around. ; He has had 8 games (on [NES], [SNES], [Saturn], [Playstation], and then there was the 5 on [Gameboy] and Meagman and Bass on [Gameboy Advance]
