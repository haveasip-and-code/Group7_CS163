blue screen of death
An error message that appears in blue and white on windows 95/98/2000/me/nt/xp/2003 boxes every time you: read a cd-rom/plug in a usb device/install new hardware/read e-mail/play solitaire/look for porn/listen to mp3's/click on start/change the background/chat over IRC/install any kind of new software/make 'backups' of windows Cd's to share with your friends/type word documents/try to get you fscking soundcard to work/calibrate your joystick/open 3rd party browsers like firefox/compile cpp files/keep your pc on for more than two minutes ect. ; The problem is rarely caused by bad memory. the main cause is bad programming, whereby a program (usualy explorer.exe, but other virii are also known) ignores memory boundries and writes data to memory locations allocated to other programs, causing them to abort.
