Hoboklahoma
Slang reference to the NYC suburb Hoboken, NJ, used to note the town's lack of discernable personilaty, character, hint of creativity, and predominance of lame vacuous blonde bimbo babes and perpetual baseball hat wearing frat boys, whose idea of exotic is ordering a Yuengling over a Miller lite, similar to those found in the state of Oklahoma.
