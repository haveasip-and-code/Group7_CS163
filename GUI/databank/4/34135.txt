french
1.French : the second most used language in the business world. Also the official language used to write treaties because it is the world's most concise language. ; 2.Also a major influence on the Engish language (arguably half of English words originate from French, and another large percentage from other languages such as German, etc) ; 3. French fries are not French, oddly enough. They're Belgian. But still an official French speaking country. ; 4.The official language, if not secondary language in a shite load of countries ; 5. Me! bwahahahahahaha
