Surf nazis must die
A really low budget Troma film. ; This is what's on the back of the DVD Sleeve, confirming how shitty the movie is; ; When the grandson of a gun wielding woman is murdered by neo-nazi surf punks in the post-apocalyptic future, this grandma hunts them down for some bloodthirsty revenge. ; It is funny in the sense that you can laugh at the poor stunts and random sex scene.
