contempolonial
Late twentieth-century example of American architecture, which is characterized by an absence of the traditional ornament, associated with the architectural style it parodies. Early examples of the centempolonial were built to provide cheap, quickly built houses for G.I.'s returning home from World War II. Today, houses of this style are built to appeal to the widest group of potential homebuyers without regard to individual lifestyles. Synonyms include [Ranchburger], McMansion, Contemporized Cape.
