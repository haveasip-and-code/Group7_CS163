clannie
Any one of a number of people, who follow one or more bands around for the soul purpose of 'socializing' at the band's shows, rather than actually listening and appreciating the music being played. The 'socializing' however, is negative: gossiping, slandering, causing drama, starting rumors, crying, fighting, looking to get laid, STALK, looking to break up with someone or cause a break up, bitching, pissing, moaning, or being a general PAIN IN THE ASS to anyone who is there, trying to hear the GOD DAMN MUSIC! See [idiot], [asshat], [hag], [bitch], [asshole], [groupie], [obsessed], [stalker], [alcoholic], and [mentally ill].
