Dog's Bollocks
bollocks n. are testicles. The word is in pretty common use in the UK and works well as a general 'surprise' expletive in a similar way to bugger. The phrase 'the dog's bollocks' is used to describe something particularly good (yes, good) - something like 'see that car - it's the dog's bollocks, so it is'. We also describe a big telling-off as a bollocking, and additionally use the word to mean 'rubbish' (as in 'well, that's a load of bollocks').
