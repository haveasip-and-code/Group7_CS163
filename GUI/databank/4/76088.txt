Ardsley
An extremely EXTREMELY pathetic town 20 minutes away from New York City. Not small enough that everyone knows EVERYONE, but let's just say that town is a Starbucks, CVS, and like six other stores? Very boring and 90% of the people here are white rich suburbanites who have no idea of life past the small walls of Westchester. It is said to be quite 'diverse' though, at least the schools, and our schools are extremely 'good' and teach us 'a lot'. Right... ; Also, sadly, the hometown of [Jesse McCartney]. Stupid druggie that he is.
