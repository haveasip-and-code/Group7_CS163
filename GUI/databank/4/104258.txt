Mike Myers
Extremely lame 'actor' whose acting skill consists of doing the same character with different clothes over and over again. Watch 'Wayne's World', 'Austin Powers', the 'Axe Murderer' one, and any of his SNL sketches. He does and says almost the exact same things but changes his clothes and tries to alter his accent.
