Terran Solar System
A system of planets, asteroids and comets orbiting an average sized, middle aged yellow star on the edge of one of the Milky Way Galaxies outermost spiral arms. The system has a single star at its heart known as The Sun. The Sun is accompanied by four rocky inner planets, three of which exist in the habitable zone, with only one that is currently capable of supporting complex life. Beyond the four solids is an asteroid belt followed by four large gas giants. One of which has a beautiful set of rings. Each gas planet has its own diverse mini system of moons. Even farther out is a small sold planetoid that is considered the ninth and final planet mostly by local tradition. The Terran Solar System is surround by several clouds of dust, rock, and ice outside of the orbits of the nine planets. These are debris left over from the system's creation. They are known as the Kepler, Kuiper, and Oort Cloud. The system's name is unusual because it takes uses a hyphenated version of the name for it's third planet. And central star; whereas most systems are just named for their main star. For example: The Vegan Star System's main star is Vega.
