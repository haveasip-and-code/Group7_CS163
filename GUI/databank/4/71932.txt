mosher (n)
A mosher -by definition- is a person (particularly youths) that 'mosh' and weares make, uniformed clothing. ; But in a deeper sense, a mosher is a person that is not afraid to resist conformity and express themselves. ; To many, a mosher is not a person that weares Dickies and Vans, a mosher is a person that will resist the norm. ; By this definition, a mosher could be a person that weares 'townie' clothing, but because i am prejudice, not many townies are intelligent enough to express themselves. Anyway, even if they were they wouldn't have much to express!
