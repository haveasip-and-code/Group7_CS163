Ah, this movie is such a classic. From the hilarious scene to where a character named Connie asks her boyfriend: 'Curtis....are you DAY-YED!!!!', to a little league baseball team getting hit by flying soda cans (the coach takes one of 'em in the crotch - HAHA!). Also, the soundtrack is by AC/DC (which, by the way, you can buy the soundtrack on CD. It's titled 'Who Made Who?'). King's only directorial film is an underrated gem. The film's plot: For a week in 1987, a mysterious comet was floating over Earth. During this week, we have truck stop customers and employees, led by Emilio Estevez (who plays a cook in this movie), trying to stay alive when automobiles and appliances come 'alive' and start killing people.
