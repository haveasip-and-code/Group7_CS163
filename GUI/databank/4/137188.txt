chav!!
Chavs are people who wander around the streets aimlessly, drinking cheap alcohol and kicking off with everybody they see, as they have nothing better to do. They wear scruffy looking trackies, tucked into their socks, to make sure they look as stupid as possible. Chavettes have bright orange faces and lots of cheap fake gold jewelerry on. :)
