soccer moms
Moms who love their kids and don't mind taking them places... especially to soccer practice. You gotta love 'em... especially those who coach soccer! Lot's of people tease them for driving big SUV's but that's because they are generous enough that they always end up driving tons of kids everywhere! They are hardworking and love their kids and soccer. It's a hard job so don't tease them... could you make dinner, lunches, breakfast, clean, drive kids everywhere,shop for an entire family,and still manage to be cheerful all at the same time?! (I'm not a soccer mom but it's annoying when people trash talk them... I am a soccer OBSESSIVE however)
