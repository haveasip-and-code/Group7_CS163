goo goo dolls
greatest band ever....slightly mainstream, but low-key enough that only 1 in 20 people will have heard the name, and only 1 in 150 will probably know any of the music. ; vocalist/guitarist [John Rzeznik] fronts the band, with amazing lyrics and wonderful, inspirational, sentimental, and completely unique songs. ; bassist robby takac sometimes writes songs and lyrics, but are usually never half as good as Rzeznik's. ; drummer rotates every once in awhile (don't get too attached) ; most famous song, 'Iris,' appeared in the film City of Angels ; best albums to date are Dizzy Up the Girl, Gutterflower, and Live in Buffalo ; superfans tend to be completely oblivious of anything else when the goo goo dolls are mentioned, and are way in love with Goo's music and spirit. ; some semi-well-known songs (besides Iris): ; Broadway ; Slide ; Dizzy ; I'm Still Here (from Treasure Planet soundtrack) ; Here is Gone ; Sympathy ; Name ; my personal favorite song of theirs at the moment is Name.
