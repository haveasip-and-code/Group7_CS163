kamehameha
1. King who made Hawaii a kingdom ; 2. Part of the Pacific Ocean to the West of Hawaii, named by Japan, unrelated to the ruler. The name roughly translates to 'wave that winds up with the turtles'(directly 'turtle contact wave') because the area was known for its turtles. So, any turtles in the area will be hit by any waves that comes trough. It definitely does not mean 'big turtle wave' ; 3. Energy attack in Akira Toriyama`s manga/anime [DragonBall]. The 'Kamehameha Wave' is noted for its intense power, so it is a very good name for an extremely powerful.
