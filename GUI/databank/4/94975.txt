B-Boy Stance
An ancient pose used by the hip hop & break dancing community in the 80's. The most popular stance is that of the arms crossed in front with hands under each arm pit while standing with head tilted slightly back. Although nobody of African American heritage does this anymore, it is mostly being kept alive today by out of touch white comedians and actors trying to act black. Usually accompanied by either a weak rhyme, [beatbox] or the term '[yo]'.
