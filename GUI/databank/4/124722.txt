Pyro
A pyro can be a range of things: If used alone pyro is a slang that is implied to mean that you like fire, But if used as a root word it relates to fire in one way or another. The slang term is used way to often kinda like [noob] or [powned]. Athough alot of people think you just need to like fire to be a pyro thats not true. To be a pyro you need to love fire, not be able to spend a day without it. Your a pyro if a day isn't normal when it lacks fire involvement. A pyro is not to be mistaken with an idiot or terrorist.
