Fedora Core
Homepage: http://fedora.redhat.com/ ; One of the two continuations of RedHat 9 after it split into [RHEL] and Fedora Core in 2003. ; Fedora Core is a completely [FOSS] [GNU/Linux] [distro] that uses [RPM], [Yum] and a modified [Linux] and is financially supported by RedHat, Inc. Fedora has a very fast release cycle, producing two or three stable releases a year. As of version 3, all of Fedora Core is rather big, taking up four CDs and a little less than seven GB of hard drive space, although not nearly that much is needed to get a Fedora system up and running. Also as of version 3, the default desktop environment is [GNOME] but included in the nearly seven GB is also [KDE] and [Xfce]. ; As of the Fedora Core 4 tests, Fedora is for the x86, x64 and PPC CPU architectures.
