St. Louis University High
College Preparatory School located in downtown St. Louis also known as SLUH. Best guy school in the city, most people think it's full of nerds and computer geeks, but that is not the case. The guys of SLUH are the most popular in the city and get any girl they want(for the most part). Yeah of course there are a few nerds, but what else would you expect from a school that requires at least a low A GPA? SLUH guys are the shit.
