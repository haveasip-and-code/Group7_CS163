ballet
an extremely rigorious but fun and rewarding SPORT. generaly stereotyped by dancing on toes, the color pink, tutus, spinning around, and being graceful. i say it is characterized by bloody feet, sore muscles, hard work, lots of sweat, falling on you butt(by mistake of course), fond memories of performing, excitement of sharing something you love with an audience.
