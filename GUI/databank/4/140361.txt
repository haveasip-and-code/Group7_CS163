Lazicon
A hybrid of 'Rubicon' and 'Laziness.' ; The exact point in a day which, once passed, you realise you're not gonna achieve or do anything within it except farting around indulging ones own whims. ; The day can start off fresh, where anything is possible, and you might even have plenty of stuff you wanna get done, but once that lazicon hits there's no going back; your remaining hours are then 100% committed to self-indulgent slobbery & overall nothing-at-all-ness. ; Sometimes you can feel a lazicon creeping up on you, having maybe a half hour window to deflect it, or see your day swept away by its siren-like allure.
