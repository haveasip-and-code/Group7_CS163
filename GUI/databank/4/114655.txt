Pointy finger of doom
This animation tactic is used in poorly dubbed Anime, especially those shows involving dueling or fighting. When a character extends their arm at full length towards their opponent(s) and then extends their index finger, this is known as giving the 'pointy finger of doom'. This is used in lou of the middle finger, or other originally written, but then dubbed trash talk.
