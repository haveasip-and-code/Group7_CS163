burning rembrandt
On June 15th 1985, a Lithuanian man entered the Hermitage museum in Leningrad, and approached Rembrandt's 1636 painting 'Danae'. He slashed and stabbed at the ancient canvas twice, then tossed a bottle of sulfuric acid at it. This event is referenced in the phrase 'a burning rebrandt'. Though acid was used to burn this painting away, anything that burns in anyway may be remarked upon as being a burning rembrandt, or as burning like a rembrandt.
