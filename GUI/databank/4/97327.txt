Nagstock
Debauched [party] or [shindig]conducted over a period in excess of 24 hours, to the accompaniment of loud cheesy or heavy metal music, involving excessive consumption of alcohol primarily [beer] and an evil concoction known as Punch concocted ceremoniously by a [lunatic] wearing a traffic cone upon his furrowed brow. ; Named for its creator, The Nag, a wise and inspired individual whose true name is now lost to the mists of time, famed for his having organised a three day festival-style party at short notice and on a shoe-string budget, and for his profoundly impressive abilities in the fields of languidity and excessive alcohol consumption. ; Recent additions to the traditional aspects of a Nagstock have included servings of Vodka Jelly and the occasional Magic Muffin. All in all making for one long heaving display of mirth and mayhem and impropriety! ROCK ON!
