cube cruising
Similar to [cube crawling], but different enough to have a distinct entry. [Cube] cruising is when a person spends a significant portion of the work day visiting cubes and chit-chatting about any and every thing. ; Cube cruisers either have too little work to do, or they simply don't care if their low productivity causes a bottleneck in the office.
