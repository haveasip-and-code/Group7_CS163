Buffalo Bills
single handedly the coolest football team in the NFL. Lost 4 straight Super Bowls in the 1990's. But the more important thing is that they MADE IT to 4 straight Super Bowls....and people still say that they sucked. Lets see the Dolphins or Patriots make it to 4 straight. ; Oh yeah, they had OJ Simpson playing for them as their star player too! ; JP Losman in 2005 all the way!
