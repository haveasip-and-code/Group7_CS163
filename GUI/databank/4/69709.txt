Richfield
Richfield is an old suburb of Minneapolis consisting of about 35,000 people. The demographic profile is close to 40% asian, 30% black, 20% senior citizens, 10% confused caucasians. Not only is it minutes from MSP Int'l, downtown Minneapolis, home of Best Buy, overshadowed by its snobby-ass neighbor to the west [edina] but is also an oxymoron.
