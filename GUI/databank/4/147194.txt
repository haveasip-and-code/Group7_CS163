METROSEXUAL
There are many misconceptions that exist in our society regarding the metrosexual male. The term, metrosexual, describes a fad and is not a social status. A metrosexual male is an individual who believes that wearing tight designer clothing gives him social status. Contrary to popular beliefs, many metrosexuals that emulate this style are living at the poverty level or with their parents. In fact, many metrosexuals are financially dependent and barely have a high school education. As a result, a lot of the metrosexuals work at menial jobs (e.g. waiter, cubical worker, and customer service representative). In addition, many overdress for the type of labor that they do, which can give others a false impression of sophistication and success. Sophistication is a word that is commonly misused by the laymen. This word describes an individual, who is well-educated, worldly, refined, cultured, and of high social status. Therefore, being sophisticated does not mean wearing tight designer clothing, drinking martinis, carrying a laptop, drinking lattes, going to upscale nightclubs, working out, plucking ones eyebrows, etc. Again, I want to emphasize and clarify that anyone can follow the metrosexual trend, but not everyone is sophisticated.
