Goomba
Taken from an Italian word meaning friend, the word is mostly used today as insulting term for Italian-Americans. By calling someone a Goomba, you are implying that they have ties to the mafia. ; An Italian New Yorker with greased back hair carrying a baseball bat saying 'Hey Tony, get a load of Sammy Sosa over here!' to ever black person that walks past him may be called a Goomba.
