I mean...
An immediate response to a stupid question, or question with a next-to-obvious answer. The placeholder is supposed to be used by itself, with the '...' implying a period of silent waiting for the question asker to re-contemplate the stupidity of his/her question and/or understand that the person that he/she is asking the question to is of superior caliber and need not waste time answering this goddam stupid question. In fact, 'I mean...' need not be used after a question. A cocky fucker can just use it all the time, and not have to say anything else!
