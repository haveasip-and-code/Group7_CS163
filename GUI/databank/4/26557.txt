Kanye West
A new rapper who I actually admire (being a rock listening person). He doesnt pull the same old Lil Jon shit like 'lets get high up in the club and fuck some bitches'. i love that. it is rare. kind of like Tupac. I definitely respect Kanye for rapping about real life and not some club & pot. Go do your thing!
