Shoe the eye pint
Taking an action with no thought for your own safety or credibility in order to save a fellow gamer from certain doom/discovery/failure. A selfless act of friendly and much-needed help. ; In this instance 'gamer' means one who is out attempting to have fun, often by meeting/pulling/hooking up with people in bars and clubs etc. Although this really could refer to anything in which one acts to help a friend in an unusual situation, such as distracting an angry husband while a friend makes his exit, or quite possibly negotiating with a Colombian drug cartel.
