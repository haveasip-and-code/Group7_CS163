libertyville
An ever growing stuck up suburban town with its inhabitants seeking to further enlarge their egos by boasting about their worthless incomes and snotty upper-class nieghbohoods. Their football team won state; but some, actually, many people wonder if they would have been as successful without the prevalent use of steroids. Home to the most notorious slut in the area, the high school has become a breeding ground for skanks and upper-class tools.
