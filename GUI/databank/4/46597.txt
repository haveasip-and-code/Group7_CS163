chalga
Chalga is a definition of gipsy music. There's an enormous difference between chalga and the so called POPFOLK, which is widely spread in Bulgaria. The POPFOLK music sounds more like pop rather than chalga. This difference should be noted, because not all of the bulgarian people listen to gipsy music. The brutal or 'hard chalga' as it's sometimes called, has nothing to do with POPFOLK! Even it is hard, some valuable texts could be found in the pile ot scum which these beautiful girls sing.
