abercrombie and fitch
A shallow, superficial, materialistic clothing brand that encourages ignorance and superficiality among teenagers and uses pornographic images in their ads. They use phrases on their t-shirts such as 'school should be optional' or 'I don't school let get in the way of my social life,' forcing idiocy upon teenagers. Abercrombie and Fitch brain-washes teenagers into believing that $60 for a t-shirt is not at all expensive. In addition, a size XL from Abercrombie and Fitch is about equivalent to a size Medium at another store.
