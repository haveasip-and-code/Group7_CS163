Kick-ass claymation cartoon from long ago! It's about this strange clay boy and his clay horse who goes around doing stupid things. They sometimes save people, they sometimes save each other, or they just BS around doing nothing. ; It's no longer showing, I believe, but when it did, it was one of the funniest shows around! Especially when you watch it as an adult.
