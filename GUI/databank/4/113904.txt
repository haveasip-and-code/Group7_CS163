TVA
A government department formed under Roosevelt's New Deal in the mid 1930s that to this day produces [gobs] of [hydroelectric] power and sells it to customers and power companies very cheaply. TVA has one of the best power grids in the nation (just look up in and around Nashville), you're going to see transmission powerlines everywhere. The typical transmission voltages they send power at are 161Kv and 500Kv, TVA also has made [Tennessee] livable through its many dams, and along with the [Corps of Engineers], has blessed [Tennessee] with many lakes to recreate within.
