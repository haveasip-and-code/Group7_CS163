homewrecker
1) One who moves in with or near you and makes your life miserable. S/He may steal your boy/girlfriend, break your property, make your friends and other close ones hate you, or many other things. ; 2) A show on the abomination that is [MTV] which revolves around Ryan Dunn from [Viva la Bam] seeking revenge on those who 'did you wrong,' whose wrongdoings so far has been pretty childish. He crashes the wrong-doer by turning their bedroom into an unlivable shit hole through means which most likely would warrant a law suit if this show weren't so obviously staged.
