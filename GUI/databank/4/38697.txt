Math chemistry
Math Chem is an intense chemistry course littered with complex math equations and impossibly described concepts that are specially designed to fry the average sophomore's brain. This class is one of the worst on earth, and the experience of math chem is made shittier by the presence of a bitchy teacher who yells at the class if one person doesn't know an ultra-specific content that comes from exactly line 19 in chapter 15, section 7 to the left of Figure 15-34. Not knowing that will lower your grade by withdrawing 60 points where no amount of extra credit will save you, and your lack of bs knowledge will lead to your suffering for all eternity.
