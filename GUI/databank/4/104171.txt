Garou: Mark of the Wolves
Made by SNK in 1999, it is considered to be Fatal Fury 4 by many. One of the best 2D fighters ever, featuring a VERY well balanced roster and rock-solid controls. Button mashing noobs have no chance at this game. [Terry Bogard] is the only 'old' SNK character here, although most of the other characters follow the same fighting styles as their predecessors (ie. Tizoc --> Raiden, and etc..). It is said to be set 10 years after the death of Geese Howard.
