Wal-Mart fall apart
Though this phrase originally referred to products from Wal-Mart being of poor quality, it may now also refer to the communities essentially destroyed by Wal-Mart - it throws its weight around and puts everyone else in the area out of business, essentially destroying the local economy while ensuring that what's left of it depends solely on Wal-Mart for survival.
