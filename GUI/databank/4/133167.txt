commieblock
Serial hi-rise public housing, usually tall concrete building that has identical buildings around it built in a cluster. Invented by socialist governments to provide fast and cheap housing for its citizens. Most of them are in countries like Russia and China and provide the bulk of public housing. Rare in Western countries, but some of American 'projects' are in fact commieblocks. Modern commieblocks are very clean, comfortable and prove to be excellent housing type with many advantages over urban sprawl.
