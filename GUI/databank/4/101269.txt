Pete Abrams
Creator of [Sluggy Freelance], and all around pioneer of web-comics. Pete has managed to post a new comic daily since 1997, and has collaborated with comic creators Ian McDonald and Clay Yount to further expand the Sluggy Universe. Creator of icons [Torg], [Riff], [Zoe] and [Bun Bun] Pete has been the impetus of modern web comics and inspired many in the field to begin their own works. He irregularly appears in his own comic as a glowing avatar, and has been known to feed his minion Shirt-Guy Tom to rabid, puffin-dingos. SluggyFreelance, and by extension Pete Abrams, was awarded the Epic Shortbread of 2004 by [WebSnark] (and by extension Eric Burns).
