Hermitage
Hermitage. It's one of the breeding grounds for sluts, whores, and druggies. Not to mention annoying and stuck up freshmen of the class of 2008. They think they own the school when, in fact, they don't. They must know every 'popular' person in the school to be 'cool.' I know I can name a few (or more like a hundred or two) that are like this. They think they are at the top just because they just 'happen' to have a brother or a sister that is an upperclassmen. or a neighbor. or 'friend' or whatever. Another thing. How they refuse to have any manners at all? Example. I'm walking to my class. Two or three freshmen are standing in my way. I say ' excuse me please '....no response. One more time. Still no response...even though they KNOW I am there. But that's enough about freshmen. Let me move on... ; but first.. ; Don't you just love how we are always on the news. about shootings and stuff? yeah. it's great isn't it? the people at our school are no civilized people like me and others. they feel the need to threat the school and the people in it. like it is some kind of fun thing to do or a trend? what in the world? wow. oh, and let's endanger the lives of about 2500 people just because the guy in the other gang 'wants your girl.' ha. that is so lame.
