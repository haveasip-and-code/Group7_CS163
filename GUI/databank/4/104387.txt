america
If the world were a high school America would be the popular, beautiful, brilliant, rich girl who everyone knows and wants to be friends with but also has people constantly talking behind her back. She's extremely ambitious and president of many extracurricular clubs. Anytime she makes a mistake everyone tries to bring her down but her self confidence is too strong to break. When times get rough everyone turns to her for her overly generous helping hand. Yet, her peers are quick to forget about all she has done and ALWAYS go right back to talking shit about her because they can't help being jealous.
