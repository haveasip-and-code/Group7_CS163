child molestor
One who engages in [child molestation], often used synonamously with [pedophile] while actually being quite different. Most child molestors will be pedophiles, yes, but you don't need to be attracted to someone to have sex with them, as many young women will tell you of old rich men. It can be done to fulfill a need to inflict violence against children or those unable to defend themselves, to get a thrill out of being bad and breaking the law, to 'try it out', to make money off distributing an illegal video, to get back at someone, to scar the kid and possibly make him a psychological dependant, or to hurt the parent of the child. ; A child molestor is a person who has sexual intercourse with an invidual under the local law's age of sexual consent. Usually refers to a legal adult, though a much older child can also be guilty of it. ; The laws are in places as societies deem children to be mentally and emotionally too immature for sexual intercourse, leading them to be manipulated and unable to protect themselves from being hurt and scarred by the experience. ; One wonders why similar restrictions are not applied as adamently to the mentally handicapped, the emotionally insecure, the easily influenced mentally immature sheep, and the stupid.
