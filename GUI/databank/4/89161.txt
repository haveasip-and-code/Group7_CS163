Northport
There is alot more to this little town, if you live here you know alot of it. Northport high school, or better known as north'pot' high school is a pertty unique high school with the best art program in ny state, and the 'commons.' Beautiful harbor and village, still has trolley cart tracks on main street. A million lil dinners and sea worthy resteraunts. People either love it and move back there to raise a family or hate it and wish to burn it to the ground. Stickers on street signs and pot holes galore! go get a half and half with a lmberjack and then u can call urself a northporter...but u have to write on the big foam cup if u want to think ur cool. and anyone who thinks e-npt is better than npt prbably lives in enpt and is jealous. Over priced houses and underpaid teachers. Its great in the summer time if u have a boat. No matter how many people say they hate living in a small town or that its boring id bet money that over half of them deep down probably likes it.
