Northern Kentucky
In reality, this is a line of land mass that makes up about a third of the Commonwealth's land mass as well as over half of its population. It runs from Henderson County on the far west end, and all the way to Maysville on the far east end, both of them along the Ohio River. The major metropolises, medium-sized cities, and large towns in this area include Henderson, [Owensboro], [Elizabethtown], Madisonville (not far from the South), [Louisville], Frankfort, Lexington, Florence, Covington, Newport, and Maysville. This large land strip is the Midwestern part of Kentucky; everything below, including [Bowling Green], Paducah, Glasgow, Somerset, and Richmond, is the Southern part of Kentucky.
