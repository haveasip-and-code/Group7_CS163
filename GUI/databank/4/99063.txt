7/7
A very crass attempt by journalists to rope the 7th of July bombings in London to 9/11. They had previously tried to dub the Madrid bombing 3/11, but strangely forgot to try this method for the Bali bombing. Of course, they don't realise how irresponsible this is due to the fact it will instantly create the impression Osama bin-Laden was involved so the reactionary press will bleat on about al-Que'da for days on end and get in the way of the police finding who was actually responsible (and it was neither al-Que'da or embittered members of the Paris Olympic Committee).
