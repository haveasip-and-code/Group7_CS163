Kyo Sohma
Kyo Sohma is the red headed hottie of 'Fruits Basket'. Kyo is cursed with the cats spirit, so when he is hugged or weak he turns into a little orange tabby. Kyo lived a life of pain rejection and misery, because of being the 'cat' who was left out of the zodiac. Yuki(who is cursed with the spirit of the rat) is Kyo's rival and they are constantly fighting. Kyo's mother commited suicide and his father blamed him. The only people who understand this hot headed kitty are [Tohru Honda] and [Kazuma Sohma]. Kyo is distant and afraid of rejection, but deep down, he just wants to be accepted.Will Tohru accept Kyo when she sees the cats 'true form'?
