Chicago Cubs
A baseball team from Chicago Illinios, with a classic home feild known as Wrigly, famous for it's ivy on the walls in the outfeild. The team it's self is quite terrible, and haven't won a [wold series] since the [stone age]. If they ever come close, there's always someone to blame it on when we fuck up weather it's be a fan or damn goat or something else retarted that it totally and completly unrealted the sport of baseball. Nicknamed the lovable losers for their blowness at it. Also have the greatist fans in the sport, and some like to poke fun at them when they're frusterated with their preformance lately........
