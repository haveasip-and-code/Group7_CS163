Wavis
Wavis is a compound formed when you take the chemical solution, ; Dexamphetamineate Methatide and Ambrosetextide, and soak it into bread. ; Once the bread is dry, it is completly harmless and is undetectable drug wise. ; The 'Wavis' at this stage is unusable, until toasted. Once the bread is toasted, the chemicals are reacted together and once eaten, it's a very potent 'trip' drug. ; It is possible to use wholemeal/brown bread, but the potency is reduced if either is used. ; The main problems with wavis is it being a photo-sensitive combustion compound. ; (take a photo usign a flash and it will combust due to the intensity.)
