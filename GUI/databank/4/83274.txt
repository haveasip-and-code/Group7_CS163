Torrington
Torrington could be described as a run down ghetto with some nice middle class neighbrhoods and a few wealthy upper class neighborhoods/ developments. The 'city' of Torrington has several dumpy plazas and strip malls along with the lack of any significant nightlife coupled with hardly any restaurants ! Unless you consider McDonalds and Burger King your restaurant of choice ! The closure of several major firms has left Torrington's local econamy stagnating and several other major manufacturers and retailers are considering leaving the area. The average income is around $40,000 and the population is around 35,000 and growing. Thankfully you can meet a lot of citizens who make more than $40,000 and live the lifestyle of most Americans !
