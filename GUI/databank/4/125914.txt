10th kingdom
A 7 hour long movie (mini series), about a girl named Virginia who is transferred through a magic mirror to a place of nine kingdoms where fairy tales are real. She struggles in her way to find home with her father and Wolf (a wolf who looks like a man, but has a tail and other wolf-like qualities), and a dog named Prince, who is really a Prince in a dog's body. Her adventures lead her to many places and meets many fairy tale characters such as Snow White, Cinderella and a family of Little Bo Peeps.
