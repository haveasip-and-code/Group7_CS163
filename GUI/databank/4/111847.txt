add me whore
A person on Myspace who goes around adding random people just to increase their friends list. They also join groups and put up 'Add Me' posts and the dumb ones post 'Add Me' bulletins (the reason this is stupid is because when you're posting a bulletin, only your friends can see it, so they've obviously already added you). You can tell if a person is an add me whore by looking at their friends list--if their list is huge, they don't have a lot of stuff filled out in their profile, and most of their comments are 'Hey! Thanks for the add,' then you've got an add me whore.
