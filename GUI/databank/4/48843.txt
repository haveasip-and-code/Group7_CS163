Chucks
Chucks are shoes put out by Converse. the complete name for them is 'Chuck Taylors'. I've also heard them reffered to as 'Connies', but this sounds lame (in my opinion). ; People have already listed a whole lot of steroetpyes that wear chucks (really anyone can wear them, they look great and have a really simple design) but no one has mentioned the B-Boys of the late 70s through to the 80s. ; While everyone know Adidas Superstars are strongly embedded in this period of history, Chucks are often overlooked. ; I've seen images of B-Boy rocking chucks with the tongues out (postitioned outside of their jeans) and with FAT laces. ; Just thought everyone should know. When i think of Chucks, i think of B-Boys and the Ramones.
