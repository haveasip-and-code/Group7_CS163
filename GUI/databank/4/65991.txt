Twirly
A twirly is what it is called when the cock is 'twirled' in a circular motion, traditionally with the index finger. It can either be self-administered, or performed by an intimate partner. A classic rendition is the reach-around twirly. This happens when, of two homosexual males, the giver of ass-sex, reaches around, and twirls the receiver's cock.
