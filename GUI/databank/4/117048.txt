N.D.G
unlike the other ghetto parts of montreal (uptown,lil' burgundy,texas,stl,DTP-downtown projects, verdun), N.D.G is definitely the ghettoest hood in MTL. it stands for 'notre-dame-de-grace' but it is called N.D.G or just D.G for short, often standing for 'niggaz deal ganja,''niggaz drugz & girlz,''no damn good' etc. It's on the westside of montreal and the most dangerous part of N.D.G is on walkley street. other well known drug spots in N.D.G include the corners of randall street, fielding st., montclair st.,chester st., and the co-ops projects on cote-st-luc.
