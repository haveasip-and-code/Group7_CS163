V.F.R. or VFR
V-Four-Racing ; The VFR line was initiated in 1986 by the Honda Corporation, and has seen almost 35 variations since that time. ; It has its' characteristic v-four 90degree engine; capturing both the low-end torque of the v-twin class, and the high-end power of the inline-four. Its' engine displacements have ranged from 400cc to 800cc, with the current incarnation settling at 800cc displacement (781cc real). ; Through out its production it has captured the hearts and minds of experienced riders; dropping and picking up the title 'Interceptor' as time has passed so many times that the name is synonymous with VFR. ; Though originally coined as a race bike, it now tends to be termed an old-mans sport bike. However by creating a bike with power, handling, and comfort in mind Honda has proved to live up to it's reputation as more than a vehicle company. Honda is an engineering company, and the VFR is no bike to be scoffed at.
