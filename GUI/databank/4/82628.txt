Bauhaus
Bauhaus as an architectural movement dating back to the 1910s which is in no way related to Gothic architecture, therefore it is plain incorrect to call 'Bauhaus' (the architecture, not the band) a type of Gothic architecture. ; Bauhaus the architecture emphasised no frills, a minimalist type of design. The band Bauhaus, which was into frills and costumes and details, probably used the name of the movement in an ironic fashion - this has been the topic of debate, but i'm confident that Peter Murphy ISN'T stupid and the name is an ironic statement!
