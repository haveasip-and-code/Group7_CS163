lubbocked
This is the unpleasant term, first used by 'Loaded' a U.K. 'lads' magazine to describe death by [fisting]. Its roots lie in the case of a young man Stuart Lubbock who was fisted to death at a poolside drugs and sex party hosted by the U.K. television celebrity [michael barrymore]. ; It is at this drugs and sex, poolside party, that [michael barrymore] and his perverted [chums] took the naieve stuart lubbock into a private bedroom, and [fisted] him to death. The medical pathologist recorded 'serious anal and rectal injuries'. Yet [michael barrymore] was aquitted and 'death by misadventure' was recorded.
