Martini
A Martini is an alcoholic drink made classically with gin and vermouth and served with a green olive (when served with coctail onions the drink is called a 'Gibson'). ; It is served chilled, often by ice in a specific shaker, then drained into the signature-style glass. ; The ratio of the two liquids is 5:1 (traditionally, 2 and one half ounces of gin to half an ounce of vermouth) usually, though by changing this, a person can make the drink 'drier' (more gin) or 'wetter' (less gin) depending on his tastes. ; Martinis can also be made with other alcoholic bases, the most common alternative to gin being vodka (often called a Vodka Martini, Vodkatini, or Kangaroo) ; Other variations of the Martini centre around the inclusion of other alcohol or flavours in the drink.
