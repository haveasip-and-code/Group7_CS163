UCR
Otherwise known as the University of California, Riverside; or the 'last resort' UC. Many who go there are said to have had no other school options-- which is not quite true for ALL students per se, but close to factual for a large chunk of the attending. ; Dorms are inhabited by mostly freshmen as second+ years run away from campus to apartments. Many go home for the weekend because the student body are 'goddamn' 'penises' and don't make better the situation they're in. ; A UCR party will consist of: ; 1. Alcohol ; 2. Alcohol ; 3. Standing ; 4. A little music ; 5. People throwing up ; The concept of 'Drinking Game' seems to allude these students. ; Notes about the campus: ; During winter, the campus is actually fairly green *gasp*
