hoggar
Resembling an imposing 2-seater buggy, the Peugeot Hoggar looks avant-garde and unreal at first sight. ; The Hoggar is a sports car for extreme conditions, with two seats and two up to the minute power trains deployed transversally, one at the front, the other at the rear, giving it the attributes of a 4-wheel drive vehicle. ; It also looks a lot like the Warthog from Halo. ; More info available at http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/
