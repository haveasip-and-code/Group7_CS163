camwhore
Someone, usually female, and often of the [scene], [emo], or [goth] 'subculture' who enjoys taking countless pictures of their heavily made-up selves and posting them online. Camwhores usually post their pictures on [myspace], less often on [livejournal] and [xanga], and sometimes even on our very own [Urban Dictionary], out of a desire for attention and to show off their low-cut t-shirts and pale, underdeveloped boobies under poor lighting. ; There are four types of pictures that the camwhore takes of herself: ; 1. The 'Emo' picture-Common on livejournal and Urban Dictionary images for [emo]. Showing 3/4 of the face, camera held high, and looking down. Sullen expression a must. Usually taken in black and white. ; 2. The 'Oops, I did it again'-Often used by scene girls on their myspace, the 'Oops I did it again' is an attempt to seem coy or playful. Taken from the front, hand over mouth, eyes pointed up and to the side. ; 3. The 'tuff' pic-Favored by ugly hardcore girls on their myspace profile. Another 3/4 view, this one is taken at eye level. Beady eyes and an angry expression shows just how xxHARDxCORExx the 'tuff' girl is. ; 4. The 'Happy Little Fairy'-Another common Livejournal pic, this one is favored by underage cutesy girls. Taken with the photographer lying on her back, camera pointed down at her face, wearing a dreamy, shit-eating gaze.
