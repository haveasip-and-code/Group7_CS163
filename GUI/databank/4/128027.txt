Lunamaria
Full name: Lunamaria Hawke ; A young female ZAFT Mobile Suit pilot from the anime series Gundam SEED - Destiny. Originally piloted a custom ZAKU Warrior, but after Shinn took up the Destiny Gundam, Lunamaria recieved the Impulse Gundam. Being the love interest of the main character as well as a pilot of a hand-me-down MS, one could speculate that it is only a matter of time before she dies in battle.
