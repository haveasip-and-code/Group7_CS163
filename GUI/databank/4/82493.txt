hustla dance
Dance that involves standing in mock boxing stance with one leg forward and fists raised. The front foot is kicked forward as the fists are rotated simultaneously in small circular motions to produce a smooth 'hustla' dance image. Usually accompanied by dark hoody, baggy jeans, and ankle high kicks of Nike, Adidas, or Reebok brands to add to the overall smoothness and sex-appeal of the hustla/dancer.
