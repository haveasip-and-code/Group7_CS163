bret hart
A 27 year Canadian veteran of the pro-wrestling industry whose proficient technical wrestling skill was overshadowed by his incessantly whining, self-pitying off-camera persona which led to the infamous [Montreal Screwjob], his final appearance in the company where he was unexpectedly denied of a title win. His delay in years to finally get over it, along with his fanatically loyal fanbase still not being over it has also hurt his image as an otherwise accomplished, if overrated superstar. Has a tendency to seek sympathy from fans by painting his foes in negative light whenever he doesn't get his way, and tends to be as morally hypocritical as people accuse the U.S. President of being.
