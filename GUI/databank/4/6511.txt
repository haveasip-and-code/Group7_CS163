kummu qasai
A [qasai] (butcher) famous for [phaddas] (voilence), drugs, thug-ery and kiting in the old city of Lahore, Pakistan. He started off as a humble butcher apprentice, but through sweat, toil and red-tape, worked his way up to the higher echelons of Lahore politics. Now a much feared assasin and still enjoys strolls in his 7-series BMW and khich in [paichay] sporting his 200 grand Rolex watch.
