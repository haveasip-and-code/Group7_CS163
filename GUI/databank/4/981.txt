White Plains
Best town in [Westchester]. As a result of several unfortunate events in the early months of 2005, this town is known for being host to parties which are destined to be abruptly ended by the city police (particularly if this party is attended by one Brian Klasner). However, police tend to use illegal tactics to end these parties, so legal action is rarely taken. ; This 'small' town has recently been drastically upsized as a result of the newly constructed movie theatre/city center. This very [diverse] town gets along very well. With a very diverse population, this is an all-around great city.
