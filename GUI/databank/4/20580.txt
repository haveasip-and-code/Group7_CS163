chanel cole
Chanel Cole was the greatest contestant of Australian Idol in history. Chanel used a combination of lyrics, melody and tone to enhance and capture the audience. Chanel was a unique and lovely individual who rather then in the competition to win, was there to create both a fashion statement and music statement. A statement of how music really should be.
