Vo Dilun
proper noun (regional U.S. English): the state of Rhode Island, as said with a Rhode Island accent. This spelling, popularized by 'Providence Phoenix' mag columnists Phillipe and Jorge, probably comes closest to the actual RI accent centered in Cranston (Cvan-stin) and Providence. The RI accent is most aptly characterized as a cross between the accents/dialects of Boston/South-Eastern New England and Long Island, NY.
