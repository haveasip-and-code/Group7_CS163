South park
The best show on telivision. Always makes fun of current events and society. During the Terri Schivo case, a south park was made (the psp episode), and when mexican immigration was at an all time high, they made an episode for that (the goobacks). The funniest episode is about the 2004 election. It makes fun of the election and PETA. South Park has four main charecters called [Kenny], [Stan Marsh], [Kyle Brofloski], and [cartman]. Has won numerous emmy's and always stays fresh by adding new charecters. New charecters added have been Token, Jimmy, and Timmy. Old charecters that have died off were Ms. Choksondick and Ms. crabtree. It was created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker.
