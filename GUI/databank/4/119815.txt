Brunel Bodge
A masterpiece in engineering disaster. Brunel University, West London happens to be well known amongst it's students as being very poorly designed, a path from a fire exit continues halfway across the grass and comes to an abrupt end.They have also just placed railings by the side of the road to stop people crossing (which would normally be fine..except this is at a pedestrian crossing.) ; NB.This is not to be confused with a design by Isambard Kingdom Brunel himself, which is the total opposite and includes at least semi elite design.
