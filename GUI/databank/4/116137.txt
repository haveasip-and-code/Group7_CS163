gongongahaffa
Gongongahaffa (guhn-guhn-gah-haf-fah): ; 'You are going to have to'. ; Gongongahaffa is almost always followed by a verb/noun pair. This v/n pair will often exhibit the same compressed quality that Gongongahaffa exhibits. The single most popular gongongahaffa expression is: Gongonahaffa-eepoo or 'You are going to have to eat poo,' which is used to convey 'You're fucked now!' to someone who has gotten themselves into a bad situation: ; Ooooh! You shouldn't have done that. Now gongongahaffa-eepoo. ; There is sometimes confusion about why this word is not 'gongahaffa' which might seem to make more sense. The answer lies in the word's origins. The word comes from a song by a musical artist named 'mr strauss': ; 'You're gongongahaffa eat poo, yeah that's what you're gongahaffa do, yeah now gongongahaffa, yeah now gongongahaffa, yeah now gongongahaffa eat poo.' ; Note that the short form, 'gongahaffa' does occur once in the song. This short form, however, is considered deprecated. It is no longer in common use. ; Gongongahaffa, in some communities, can be preceeded with 'You're.' Despite the obvious redundancy of doing so, it is considered technically correct, albeit a little strange, to do so.
