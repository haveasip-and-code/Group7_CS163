fashioncore
the afformentioned 'fashioncore' t-shirt was created by Floyd the ex (maybe present) merch guy for taking back sunday, not 18V. it was made only to poke fun at a few so called 'sceensters' Floyd saw at a show who, upon exiting the pit proceded to check their hair in there shiney aviator sunglasses. only a hand full of shirts were made, although plans for a slew of fashioncore merch were kicked around all were eventually squashed.
