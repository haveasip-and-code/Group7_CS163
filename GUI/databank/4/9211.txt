hair metal
A genre that like most genre of music has some good bands but also has some posers. The posers really make the genre look bad. ; An example of a good bands would be Motley Crew. ; An example of a poser band would be Kiss. They are more of a travelling theatrical group than they are actually a band. ; But I must say Hair Metal really isn't metal at all. Nothing is heavy about it.
