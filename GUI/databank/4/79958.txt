Port Jefferson High
The smallest High School in the area. By the time you graduate you are sick of everyone because you either a) had more than 4 classes with them since grammer school b) you know their entire background and why they are the way they are, and they know your entire background c) you've hooked up or dated them or everyone d) there is no avoiding these people, you will bump into them almost anywhere, because they are always searching for new people to hang out with just as you are.
