dir en grey
One the most well-known japanese rock band, famous for their lead singer kyo - a beach blond weird dwarf - who cries/screams/shrieks and (used to)spit fake-blood/sperm/saliva during the songs, their weird and stoical drummer Shinya, their (no longer) beautiful and androgynious bassist Toshiya and their two guitarists Kaoru (leader) and Die. Formed in 1998, they released 5 albums so far, and came in Europe (France and Germany) in summer 2005. Considered as one of the biggest visual-kei-related jrock bands (even though they officially no longer belong to that movement). They are (unfortunately) the priviledged target of -bad- fanfiction writers, who like/tend to introduce kyo as an irresponsible 12-years-old sleepy head, toshiya as a slut, kaoru and die as perverts, and shinya as a female.
