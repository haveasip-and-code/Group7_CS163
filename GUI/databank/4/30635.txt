throws Mike at it
The ultimate solution to fixing badly done anime dubs. ; 1. Find Mike McFarland ; 2. Kidnap him and take him to your place of residence. ; 3. Pick him up ; 4. Throw him at your TV while a badly dubbed anime is on the screen ; 5. Repeat while yelling 'FIX IT!' ; Note: This was brought about during a conversation about how much we respect Mike McFarland and the amazing job he is doing on [Fullmetal Alchemist]. I'd like to add in here a defintion for God reading 'God: Mike McFarland' but have person convictions against that.
