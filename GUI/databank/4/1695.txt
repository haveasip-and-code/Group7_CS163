final fantasy x-2
The sequel to Final Fantasy X. Dubbed shitty by guys who are so uncomfortable with their sexuality that they hated it based on the premise that they played a female character and the abilities system is based on different outfits. Didnt necessarily need to introduce a totally different storyline, it was needed to tie up loose ends from X. In all, a pretty good game. Touching, I might say.
