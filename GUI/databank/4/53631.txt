Rumery
Noun, also see 'Coach Rum.' A large, manatee-shaped creature with a plethora of great, oozing blisters profusely erupting over the entire facial area.

She has quite the affinity to 'lemon' Gatorade. ; Her mating shrieks have been known to be heard by canines only. She has often been known to try to 'siren' children to her after-school 'tutoring' sessions through use of her ultra-soprano singing voice, usually blaring out a country tune. ; Her other weakness is her source of power - her ever-expanding stomach, or 'crystal ball,' if you will. She rubs it constantly to keep her strength up. ; Beware! Spewing puke might occur during the early morning hours. Keep out of range! She can shoot up to 50 feet!!
