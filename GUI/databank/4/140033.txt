fliesh
A man of unique interests and tastes. Finds hilarity in the concept of bondage, but will never partake in it. Believes that great knowledge lies in the repetition of odd words such as: hoist, dredged, and foot. Has a deep seeded fear in the existence of goblins, gouls, and mentally disabled patrons working in public service. Loves women before all.
