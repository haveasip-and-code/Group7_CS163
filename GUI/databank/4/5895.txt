uglylera
1. A nickname, not completely uncalled for, given to the often underappreciated and highly talented singer Christina Aguilera, who's dressing style and so called 'dance steps' (read strip-tease show and softporn acting), along with her dirrty lyrics and tons of makeup on her otherwise pretty face has led people to descibe her in this non-flattering fashion. ; 2. To be overtly sexual in an ugly, dirty, over-the-top sort of way, making you look more or less uglylera-like.
