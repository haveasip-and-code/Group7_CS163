kregs
Short for 'crossed-legs', a technique used by bodyboarders to enhance the stylefactor of foward or reverse spin moves. When the bodyboarder raises his/her legs up in the air while doing a spin, as you do, they cross their legs over one another before releasing them into [spregs] at the end of the spin. ; Origins of the term are unkown, but it is likely that it was created in Western Australia as it is widely used here, and all the maddest bodyboaders come out of WA yeew!
