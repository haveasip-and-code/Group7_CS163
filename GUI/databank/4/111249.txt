Teabaggin
In BDSM circules, particularly femdom, teabagging has a different meaning. ; You take a male, possibly tied up, and a glass of ice water and move the glass so that his balls are submerged in ice water. It is important to bob them on and off or he will just go numb. Much more painful to do it on and off. It is even more effective if you switch between ice cold, and very warm water. (Not hot water, you do not want to cause burns. It should be cool enough to comfortably hold your finger in it for a full minute.) ; If the bottom isn't tied up then there is a psychological aspect to it. And if there is D/s involved then the bottom might be ordered to do the bobbing. ; Girls should think about this if they are asked if they want to try teabaggin
