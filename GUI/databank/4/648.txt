Water Polo
The best sport is the whole god damn world, with the fittest athletes around! Played with 7 players. 6 field and 1 goalie, where field players have to put the ball past the goialie and into the cage to get points. Sound easy? It's the combination of soccer, football, under water wresting, and a little boxing.It is alot better and harder than football.
