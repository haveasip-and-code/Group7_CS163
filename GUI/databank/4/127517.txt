Morocco
So yeah it's a country in North Africa, got beautiful beaches and mountains, great weather the whole year, especially in my Casablanca :)Home of the Couscous and other original dishes... it's got the best cuisine in the world (Really!), French Chefs got money that's why they're considered better.Moroccan people are nice people in general, but they're severely stereotyped... as Siham said they think we are all black, it's true some are black but actually Morocco is a melting pot.... lots of white people in there we all live in peace and harmony. it's true that the majority of people are 'middle-class' not to say poor, but we're up to date with everything, we got TV, cars,internet, mobile phones and all the rest.Main cities are: Casablanca, Rabat, Tanger, Fes, Marrakech, Agadir. cities like Marrakech and Agadir have been corrupted by massive tourism but anyway, we still want you to visit us :),people in Morocco speak Arabic, and French is a second language. humm what's more.. Moroccans rock!
