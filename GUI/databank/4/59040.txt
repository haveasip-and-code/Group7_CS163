They will usually have only one or two groups of interest, and are extremely passionate and knowledgeable about them. Often, a nerd will focus on numbers and definitions.

Sometimes dorks will fit in this category, too. ; Here, only geek and gamer have a positive connotations, the rest are deemed insults.
