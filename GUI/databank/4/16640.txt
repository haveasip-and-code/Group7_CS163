St. Anger
St. Anger is Metallica's latest album. It is way too under-rated. No, it's not as good as Ride The Lightning. But, you have to listen to it!! ; Great Songs are Frantic and St. Anger. Some Kind Of Monster is good, too. ; Listen to it when you're alone with no distractions and you'll see what I mean. This is what I did. And, I love it. (Not as mucgh as Ride The Lightning!) ; If it still sucks, then you suck, ; METALLICA ROCKS!
