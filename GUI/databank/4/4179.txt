hogmaws
the linings of pigs' stomachs, also commonly known as tripe. Notorious in soul food cooking because on the motherfuckin' plantation whitey would only give us the shitty parts of animals left over, such as pigs and cows, so niggas had to make do, ya know what I'm sayin'? Not to be confused with chitlins, which are pig intestines.
