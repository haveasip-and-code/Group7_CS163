elusive letter k
Originated when Tollie (I) was obsessed completely with A Series of Unfortunate Events. Tootles and I were using the Sebald Code in our online journals - I wrote a small, extremely odd script about two people in a boxing ring. The male commented on how it was the perfect place to box, and the female said why yes, much better than a tree or a large barn with the elusive letter K on it. ; That is the origination of the elusive letter K - it is used when someone says something, and the other person replies [k]. The example shows this.
