Fedex Pope
A game often played by pre-teens who have run out of pot and need to occupy themselves. First, all the Cardinals convene, then when a new Pope is chosen, white smoke billows out of the empty bong. The new Pope chooses his royal name (something to the effect of G-Money, or Pube XVI), and then his position is secured by placing an empty Fedex box on his head.
