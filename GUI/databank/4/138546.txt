Amanita Muscaria
Also known as Fly Agaric, Amanita Muscaria is the legendary red capped mushroom speckled with white dots. Containing the psychoactive compound Muscamol, Amanitas are hallucinogenic if injested. ; It is highly recommended against eating an amanita raw. The best experiences typically come from drying them completely and eating them, or making tea from a crushed dry amanita (it is best not heat the water completely to boiling). A fair dose to feel any effects would range from 3 to 10 grams (1 to 3 caps). ; Amanitas range widely across the Northern Hemisphere, generally in northern Europe and the northwestern area of North America. ; The effects vary GREATLY among users of Amanita, as their chemical makeup can vary depending on the season, climate, and location they are picked in. Never consume an amanita whose cap has fully opened (unless you want a bad time). ; Commonly sought after effects include: dissociation, euphoria, and sedation. Negative side effects may include: physical exhaustion, sweating and mild to moderate nausea. ; This is not an extensive view of the amanita as reliable research should be done on any substance before consumption. ; Currently, Amanita is legal to possess and injest in the United States.
