montana
A very beautiful, exciting state in the northwestern region of the United States. ; Very good areas to go snowmachining, and lots of beautiful mountains and rivers. Oh, and the meth capital of the U.S is actually North Dakota, just so you don't get confused by the idiot who wrote that above me.
