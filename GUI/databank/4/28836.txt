duality
A great game that didn't get made. Originally designed by Double Aught Software, it was to be an incredible first person shooter (or egoshooter). It takes place on a planet which has extremely hot weather on one side, and perpetual darkness and ice on the other, due to its axis being pointed toward the sun. In the early plot ideas, an alien race (non-human, as they have four arms and are three meters tall) had colonized this planet. However later, they were replaced by humans. The new humans can only live at the equator, where there is normal weather, just a narrow band around the planet. The humans are divided into two main classes: The high classes, aristocrats and the preistly factors; and the low classes, the workers and the polys, (the polys are a physicly deformed species) They have lived on this planet so long, with the ruling class of factors controlling all technology through the guise of spiritual leadership, that they do not remember where they came from (Earth). It is beleived by a rebel faction that the factors are spreading a plague to control population, that is why you were captured, to test a syrum. If the syrum is the antidote to the plague, it proves that the factors have indeed been spreading it. You are thrown into the middle of this, and must unlock the secrets of the past. There are also several alien species inhabiting the planet, including the hunched grrlopers, spider-like infess, and flying airpede, as well as the builders, a sentient race living underground in hiding where it was forced to go when attacked by a powerful enemy. They and their enemies are slowly awakening... ; Duality had its own engine, it even had a level editor which did not require another modeling program. It had a variety of weapons and an intriguing story. Unfortunately, Double Aught didn't even release an open source version of what they had when they shut down the project.
