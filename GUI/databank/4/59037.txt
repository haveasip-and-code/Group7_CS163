DMB
Acronym for Dave Matthews Band. This is a Jam Band consisting of Dave Matthews on Vocals and Guitar, Stefan Lessard on Bass, Carter Beauford on Percussion, Leroi Moore on Sax (Woodwinds), and Boyd Tinsley on Violin. While many such as Butch Taylor have toured with the band on a regular basis, only one other person has officially been a member. Peter Griesar was the keyboardist for the band during its infancy in the early 90's. The band first played live in 1992 and have continued to do so ever since. Tape trading similar to the grateful dead's cult following has fueled the bands progression to world fame. DMB's music is very diversified and includes acoustic rhythmn, world music, and classical influences rolled up into a 'jam band'. The music produced embodies a large emotional spectrum and common themes are death, life, drugs, and sex.
