Shlomo the Camel
* Shlomo the Camel is a famous camel often used in songs (Shlomo the Camel has 100 humps, 100 humps, 100 humps, Shlomo the Camel has 100 humps and that is how he goes, backwards) (only it sounds better in Hebrew than in English). It's mainly a road song, like 100 bottles of beer on the wall. ; * Shlomo's character has been deformed and mutilated when it was carried over to such concepts as being the CEO of 'Hashish for Free', and/or having e^1 or phi or pi or i humps (those are all unique mathematical numbers). ; * Generally, Shlomo is just an ordinary camel, but for some reason he's very famous, perhaps because of his incredibly unbelieveably stupid name. ; = For more words of wisdom check [dracoturtles].
