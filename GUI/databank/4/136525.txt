Bitgod
Someone who yearns for the the way things were 'Back In The Good Old Days' and automatically assumes that way on which they imprinted was the-way-it-should-be. Bitgods are not always incorrect in that belief -- but they are autonomic about it and haven't thought it through. The word is the acronym for 'Back In The Good Old Days'.
