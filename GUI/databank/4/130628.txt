Kneesie
A form of practical martial arts involving thrusting the knee into someones thigh or knee. A painful experience that doesnt cause lasting harm physical but can mentally cripple a man. Few people can actualy Kneesie but in fact threaten others with it. Outlawed in several states and legend has it that it originated in a school field when a [JEEP] assaulted a member of the general public resulting in him being Kneesied into a rugby post.
