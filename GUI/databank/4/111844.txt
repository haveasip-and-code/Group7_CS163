sauce bernaise syndrome
Being sickened by the taste, smell or even thought of a particular food or drink because, on a previous occasion you became ill shortly after consuming it. Your mind has made a connection between the food/drink and the illness although it was purely coincidental, and the food/drink item actually was not the cause of the illness.
