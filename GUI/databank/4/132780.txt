load juggler
A person skilled in the art of juggling several objects held in the hands, blanced on the arms and against the chest etc. To make the load more bearable or to put something down, the load juggler will shift different objects around his body. Such a practise is called load juggling. Skilled load jugglers can often slip things into their pockets, overturn the whole load and even throw a few objects in the air whilst shifting the rest around in the hands before catching them.
