staten island
One of the five burroughs in the state of New York. Plagued with cloned girls and '[gangsta]' boys, Staten Island becomes less and less bearable to live in. There is virtually nothing to do on Staten Island so getting [fubar] is the only logical thing to do to keep busy. The good thing about Staten Island is the easy comute to Manhattan without having to drive which makes going out to clubs and bars on the weekend an easy task.
