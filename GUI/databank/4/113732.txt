lopezed
The act of someone altering your ideals of beauty by being attractive in so many ways, including physically, as to redefine beauty for you entirely; The act of being humbled with respect to your superficial manners of categorizing and simplifying the world around you using arbitrary standards (and asinine statements) which have no real relationship to reality, true desire or appreciation of beauty; the act of admitting that, no matter what ideals of beauty one holds true in general, most of the time the greatest beauties that are expeerinced in life are those which challenge prefabricated, prescriptive and ultimately limiting ideals.
