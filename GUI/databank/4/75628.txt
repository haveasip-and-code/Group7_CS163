weap
a long time ago somebody said weap. Spelled weap. You obviously knew that it wasnt spelled weep by the way they said it. They came to the conclusion, that weap is a noun. A weap is a small homeless man wearing but one sock and underdrawers on his nose. I dont know how he does it... but he manages with the help of the good lord. Amen.
