hemaga
Hemaga (pronunciation HE'-m&#301;-juh) adj. ; 1. Very great in size (mass, weight, girth, height and/or length). ; 2. Extremely significant and important. ; Origin: ; My buddy and I were walking along the railroad tracks to go fishing. We saw a freight train sitting idle on a second pair of rails. One of the boxcars had graffiti spray-painted on the side. The largest piece of graffiti read: ; 'People Are BIG ; MACHINES ARE HEMAGA!!' ; We interpretted this as meaning that a piece of machinery is much large than a human being. Even though this is not always true (e.g. person vs. blender), it was true at the time (e.g. person vs. train).
