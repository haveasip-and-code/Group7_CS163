belly button hair film
This is the direct result of not owning a [bedside rag]. A belly button hair film occurs after you have goo'd on your stomach lying in bed. The goo gets on the hair between your pubes and your belly button, so you try to get it off by placing your thumb and fore fingers together and sliding them up the hairs. This gets the bulk of the goo off but leaves a film of goo between the hairs. And this is known, to me, as belly button hair film.
