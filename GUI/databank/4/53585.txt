Mad Cactus
An all-knowing, invincible cactus with a serious attitude problem. Whenever it dances, small annoying children are thrown into an interdimensional time portal and are ripped apart halfway through. Then it hangs out in front of Denny's, pissing people off because it's such an ass. Then it dances some more.
