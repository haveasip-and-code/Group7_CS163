Garandoo
Garandoo is used in a greeting between Excel and Pedro from Excel Saga. The original meaning is unclear but the word appeared in a Japanese singer's album title. The singer was well known for wearing skimpy clothes and people wondered if the hair on his stomach wasn't from...down there. The definition of the word is now considered to be thick body hair and how this has to do with Excel and Pedro using it as a greeting is unknown.
