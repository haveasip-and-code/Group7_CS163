badger badger badger
An intellectual movie in which several [badger]s dance and sing. They appear to be singing 'badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger' (etc) and then 'mushroom, MUSHROOM!' ; What they really are singing is 'magic magic magic magic magic magic' and then 'mushroom, MUSHROOM!' ; The occasional incident in which they articulate the beautiful word 'snake,' they say something like 'oohhh a snake, it's a snaaaake' but if you listen closely it sounds like 'hallucinate.'
