drummer
Drummers are the hardest position in a band to fill, and keep filled. A good drummer is hard enough to find, but a good drummer who is also responsible and committed enough to be in a working band is rare. ; Many good drummers are just flakes, or crazy, or un-reliable. Hey, they hit things all day, right? Conversely, many responsible drummers are just not good. There is something in the raw talent to play the drums that also makes a person a little crazy, more so than other musicians. ; So, if you find a good drummer who is actually responsible, hold onto that guy!
