L'Arc~en~Ciel
L'Arc~en~Ciel, otherwise known as L'Arc and Laruku is a Japanese rock/pop group that started in 1991. Their line up is currently as follows: ; tetsu - leader, bassist. ; hyde - vocals. ; ken - guitarist. ; yukihiro - drummer. ; (more on L'Arc can be found at laruku.com, an excellent English fansite) ; The line up was changed in the beginning of the band's career, but the most notable switch was their drummer. Sakura was their drummer before he was busted on heroin/drug possesion and was replaced by yukihiro. ; L'Arc~en~Ciel's popularity and fan following is insane in both Japan and overseas, even after more than a decade. All four members have sucessful side projects, and hyde has acted (erm... his skill at that is questionable >_>;) in movies, alongside the infamous [Gackt], and Chiaki (the girl in Kill Bill). ; Side notes: ; - there are tons of inter-band pairings in L'Arc, but most the most common jrock pairing involving L'Arc would be between [Hyde] and solo/ex-Malice Mizer vocalist [Gackt]. ; - The band is nicknamed 'Laruku' because that's how the Japanese pronounce 'L'Arc' ; - Serious annoyance of mine. It's spelt L'Arc~en~Ciel. Yes, the A is capitalized, yes there are tildes (~).
