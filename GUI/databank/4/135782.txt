pseudoship
It's when the projections and ideas of a person outweigh the reality and knowledge you currently possess of them. It's when a connection is driven more by optimism, than reality. It's usually found somewhere between the acquaintance stage and the friendship stage- though it often feels higher than the friendship stage because so much hope is invested in the potential manifestation of the person you're in the pseudoship with.
