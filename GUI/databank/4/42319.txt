The Callaghan Clap
Originated by the man, the myth, the legend, Bill Callaghan. The Clap is what Bill uses to signify that the drink is on him at the wonderful JJ Bubbles. If you're not paying attention, Bill will wait and start to get angry that you're not acknowledging him, or he will simply give you the 'Air Clap' from a distance.
