Washington Heights
(also known as the heights, da heightz, home of the haze, domincans'vill and like our parents say: Guashington Heights) ; The neighborhood in uptown Manhattan- NY famously known for the large population of Dominicans. It goes from 157th street all the way up to Dyckman. ; Used to be New York's crime capital back in the 50's through the late 70's and had alot of Irish, Jews, crackheads, prostitutes and in much more poverty. Not so much anymore though. However, you still see alot of Jews and rich white people hidden in the quiet neighborhoods nobody knows about.
