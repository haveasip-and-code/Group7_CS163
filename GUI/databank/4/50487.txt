St Mary's
St. Mary's College aka SMC aka Summer Camp for big kids. Commonly confused with Mount St. Mary's, but everyone knows we are so much cooler than them. We get to spend our lazy days skipping classes and hanging out down by the river. Pot is at the top of the food pyramid right next to alcohol. Regular attire is a polo, with the collar popped of course! Pleasant, Monks, the point and the Door are always fun spots to chill (watch out for the townies at the bars tho) If its your birthday you better stay clear of the pond. Once you come here you never want to leave. So pop your collar, grab a beer and head down to the docks!!!
