Lenny Bruce
Born 1925 Died 1966 ; One of the pioneers of shock comedy - and comedy altogether. Performed material that would be risque today but did it in the 1950's and 60's. Arrested on many occasions for 'indecency' (the police were really gay back then and actually arrested him during shows). Died of a heroin overdose in 1966.
