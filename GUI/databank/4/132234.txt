People Greeter
A poor miserable soul who's life is usually a total mess, not because they are extremely unattractive, unheathly, soiled, and smell like feces, but because of the simple fact that the only job they could get is sitting at the entrance of wal-mart stumbling around scaring small children into taking stickers. These people greeters usually have no more than 4 teeth total and weigh more than the average refrigerator.
