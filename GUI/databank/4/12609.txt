wellingborough
A once sleepy rural town full of harmless locals a bit on the thick side but nevertheless friendly. ; Since the sixties the town has filled with ethnics from the Indian sub continent.They are now into 2nd generation atitudes and give the town an air of Dehli on a bad night. ; Good points...The parking is free.
