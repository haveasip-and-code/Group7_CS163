Karachi
From the places I've been, this is one of the most filthy in the planet. Bad-looking place, bad-looking people, bad-mannered professionals, bad food, bad-traffic! It is such a hell that we can understand why so many pakis are fleeing that place. After visiting Karachi, one must say it is an irony that the country's translation means 'The Land of The Pure People'!
