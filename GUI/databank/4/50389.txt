Nigger Wagon
A modern revision of the term Paddy Wagon, or an enclosed motortruck used by police to carry prisoners. ; The term originated during the 1920s to describe police vans because they picked up so many 'Paddies', or Irish Americans. ; Seeing that drunken Irish are no longer a menace given the rise of gun shooting, gangsta ass niggers many feel a revision of the term is in order.
