iq crew
An effort by Circuit City to try and do something for their customers before they go out of business. IQ Crew is their computer 'tech' dept that will keep working on your computer until: ; a.) You get tired of taking it there and take it to someone who can actually fix it or b.) The computer has been there so long it is not worth paying the bill to pick it up.
