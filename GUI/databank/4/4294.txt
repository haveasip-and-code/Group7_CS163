Hagerstown
A growing city in Western Maryland. Surrounded by hick towns (Hancock, Williamsport, Boonsboro) but it is the metropolitan area of Western Maryland. H-Town is highly underrated by bored teenagers who can't find anything to do. Also, Hagerstown only has 10.7 square miles to it's name, but over 37,000 residents living there.
