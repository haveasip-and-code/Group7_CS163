simon and garfunkel
THE duo of the sixties, and THE greatest musicians of any era. Had a reunion at the Grammys several years ago, and held a nationwide tour entitled 'Old Friends' last year. Popular for songs like The Sound of Silence, Mrs. Robinson, The Boxer, their amazing arrangement of Scarborough Faire, and Bridge Over Troubled Water. Paul Simon did almost all the writing, but they wouldn't have made it without Art Garfunkel, who provides amazing harmonies.
