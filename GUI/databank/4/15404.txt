one over tanch (1/tanh)
slightly obscure this one, but was nevertheless widely used for a while in central london. it means to chill, relax, often along with smoking weed. derived directly from [cotch], its root is interesting... the mathematicians amongst you will know that hyp(cos) is written 'cosh', and pronounced 'cotch'. this is trigonometrically equivalent to one over hyp(tan), or '1/tanh', pronounced 'tanch'. most people are unaware of this - its nevertheless used widely.
