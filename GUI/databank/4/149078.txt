Mount Olive
Mount Olive is a place located in a suburb of a suburb of yet another suburb in northern NJ where the best thing to do on a friday night is to hang out in the dunkin donuts parkin lot. Probably the worst place on earth because the cops have nothing better to do but harrass everyone who isn't at dunkin donuts. Oh and its filled with quite possibly the worst people in the world because if your not at dunkin donuts, your not cool apparently. And if you are from Mount Olive and under the age of 18 apparently you have to act like your hard and from the ghetto because its not like your upper middle class kids.
