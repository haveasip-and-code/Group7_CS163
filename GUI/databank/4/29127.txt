Pan Galactic Gargle-Blaster
A potent drink invented by Zaphod Beeblebrox. The effects have been likened to having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. ; There are many voluntary organizations which will help to rehabilitate you after you've had one. ; The Guide has instructions for mixing a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster yourself: ; 1. Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit. ; 2. Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V. ; 3. Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost). ; 4. Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia. ; 5. Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic. ; 6. Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink. ; 7. Sprinkle Zamphuor. ; 8. Add an olive. ; 9. Drink ... but ... very carefully ...
