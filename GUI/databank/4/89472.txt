sexin' the black
A phrase used to describe the method in which one preps a Black and Mild cigar (with the plastic mouthpiece) for smoking. ; To 'sex the black' the cigar must be unopened in its wrapper. Take it between your hands vertically (mouthpiece on bottom) and place hands flat against eachother and move hands forward/backwards alternately. Continue for a few seconds. Remove from wrapper. ; This evenly loosens up the fine tobacco for a great smoke. Enjoy.
