stairwelling
The act of having an illicit encounter with a hot coworker in the only private place available in the office building: the stairwell. Usually includes fluorescent lighting, strange noises from exposed pipes, and the risk of being discovered by other stairwellers. Can be very romantic despite these characteristics, depending on the parties in attendance.
