The Fury
a distinct and powerful phenomenon that emerges from the bowels of a person's being when he/she is overcome by annoyence, frustration, or just sheep pissed-offedness. It is characterized by a rise in temperature, a surge in adreniline, and the incomprehensible desire to destroy anything and everything within a two mile radius, preferibly in a terrifying and disturbing manner. (Not to be confused with PMS)
