scopin the jobe
John Jay alteration of scopin the jope. ; Scopin the jobe is used to describe a very tappable peice of ass (or any good aspect of chick) that walks by. This 'jobe' must be a female, not weigh more than the scoper, not be able to beat the scoper up, and must have a full set of presentable teeth to be considered 'scopable'
