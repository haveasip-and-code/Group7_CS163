Chulligan
A chug mulligan, shortened to chulligan. In golf, if you hit a bad shot, you can request a chulligan. The other players immediately start the clock, and you have two minutes (or whatever time you designate before the match) to down a full beer and hit your do over shot. There is law of diminishing returns with this rule, as the more chulligans you use, the more likely you are to puke and not be able to hit a decent do over shot.
