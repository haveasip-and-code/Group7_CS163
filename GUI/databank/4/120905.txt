Write that on a notecard and send it to my office
A term said when somebody is tired of somebody elses moaning and complaining about something or someone else. It is not a term used towards someone respected or endeared, and it is pretty damn funny when somebody says it. It is usually said to that annoying kid who nobody likes or that nerdy girl sitting in the back of class yelling at you for cheating off her. Or just anybody else who you are getting sick and tired of.
