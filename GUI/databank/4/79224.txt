policy debate
best f-ing thing ever. the 2005-2006 topic is: Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially ; decrease its authority either to detain without charge or to search ; without probable cause. ; My favorite arg: Foucault, baby. Debaters are generally smarter than you, hotter than you, bigger than you, badder than you, and generally better than you in any way imagineable. especially policy debaters. Big shout out to all my TOC homies out there GOOD LUCK.
