Chester Hosoda
Ugly character on Degrassi, face covered in moles. He's new and he had a crush on [Manny Manstealer] his first episode. He is romantically linked to [Darcy], the cute cheerleader, and it seems as though he has a crush on [Emma Nelson], an environmentalist who enjoys giving oral sex to [Jay] and being a vegetarian (just not when she's in the van with Jay.) She's riddled with [gonhorrhea].
