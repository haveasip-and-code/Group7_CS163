final solution
Phrase referring to the ungodly evil plan to exterminate all Jews by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi pollitical party during WWII. Evolved between 1933 and 1941 as Hitler's political and military fortunes shifted, although Hitler himself made it clear in as early as 1924 that 'it is necessary to rid Germany of all Jews.' ; Some accounts have Hitler and the Nazi party only wanting Jewish culture and it's beliefs removed from Germany, however it is commonly believed that he wanted them physically exterminated (dead).
