flake music
Awesome pop/rock band from Albuquerque, though they only produced one album (When you land here it's time to return) James Mercer, Jesse Sandoval, and Marty Crandall continue to make excellent music, they now call themselves the shins and have since added bassist Neal Langford to the group.
