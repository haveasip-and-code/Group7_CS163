gook
A derragatory term used against Korean and Vietnamese individuals. The term came about when American troops participating in the Korean war, heard the term 'Miguk' which is the Korean word for the United States of America. The term is pronounced similarly to 'Me Gook'. The Americans thought the Koreans were calling themselves gooks and the name stuck. The name also refers to Vietnamese individuals as American GI's really had no idea what the difference between any Asians were.
