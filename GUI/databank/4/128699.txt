H.P. Lovecraft
One of the most brilliant minds in literature of all time. H.P. Lovecraft's work can be categorized as horror, Gothic, fantasy, and mystery. With influences by the captivating and mysterious work of the artist, Sidney H. Sime and the ethereal dream-worlds of the author, Lord Dunsany, H.P. Lovecraft's work is the epitome of great Gothic literature. Some of his works include Dagon, The Shadow Over Innsmouth, The Cats of Ulthar, The Doom That Came to Sarnath, At the Mountains of Madness, The Thing on the Doorstep, and the infamous The Call of Cthulhu. Lovecraft's stories continue to spark the imaginations of authors today. There are countless modern Cthulhu Mythos and movies based on his stories. But nothing can come close to the original work of H.P. Lovecraft.
