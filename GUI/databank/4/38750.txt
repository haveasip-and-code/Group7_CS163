mah' MAN (var.)
(said with emphasis, but while looking very casual and distratcted; popular term now among young white women): a boy friend who forgets to pick you up at the 7-11 after your grungy 8 hr. shift, but with immortal words 'be right back, baby' then asks you for a Jefferson to buy some 'smokes' back, baby' and is gone for 5 hours.
