Beyonce
If a woman has been going out with a guy for ages and they openly talk about getting married, they know that they will but he has not yet proposed yet then he is the woman's 'Beyonce'. The B is for boyfriend and the 'eyonce' is for Fiancee but obviously more recogniseable as a word for the pop star.More than a boyfriend but not yet a Fiancee. This word is in the same category as recent craze for new words for couples such as 'Bennifer' (Ben Afleck and Jenifer Lopez) and 'Brangelina' (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie)
