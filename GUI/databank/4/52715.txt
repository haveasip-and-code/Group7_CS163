Daisy Dukes
'Daisy Dukes' are extremely short, form-fitting, denim cut-off shorts worn by young women, originally in the American South. They were named after the character Daisy Duke (portrayed by actress Catherine Bach) in the early 1980's American television series, The Dukes of Hazzard. ; With the absence of the 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, the term would certainly have lost its popularity and meaning without the 1990's hit song 'Dazzey Duks,' by Hip Hop artist Duice. Duice not only revived the term 'Daisy Dukes,' but also introduced it to a new generation not aware of the terms origins. From country to urban, Daisy Dukes will always be remembered as 'denim short shorts.'
