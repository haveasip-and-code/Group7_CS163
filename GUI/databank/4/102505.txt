P90
The P90 (Project 90) is a SMG, part of the PDW (Personel Defense Weapon). It uses 5.7x28mm round, which looks like a scaled down 5.56 NATO round. There are a lot of discusions about the efficiency of this ammo, because of it's size. But still it can pierce through any type of military vest, at the range of 100-200m. It's ergonomic and can be used by both left and right hand. It uses a bullpup layout, so it's compact, and it's quite light - about 2,2kg. The results show it's quite acurate too. ; The P90 has an interesting design, and ejects the spent cases in the back of the weapon. It uses quite an interesting and big magazine, which in the end aligns the round with the reciever.
