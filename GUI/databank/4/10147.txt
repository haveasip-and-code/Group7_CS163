Kenenisa Bekele
22 year old Ethiopian distance running sensation. Bekele has won the World Cross Country Championships' short course (4k) and the long course (12k) together in the last three years. Previously, this had never been done at all, let alone by someone so young. Bekele proved himself on the track at the 2003 World Championships by winning the 10k. In 2004, within a period of 8 days, he eclipsed his fellow countryman Haile Gebrselassie's 5k and 10k records by approximately 2 seconds each. In both races he had no one to challenge him, and the rabbits did not do their job properly, so it is generally assumed that he will continue to lower his own world record. He recently won the Olympic gold medal in the 10k in olympic record time (27:05). He was so dominant that he ran the last lap in 53 seconds and said 'It was no problem for me' after the race. He is the favorite in the upcoming 5k Olympic Final which will be one of the most competitive distance races of all time featuring Bekele, 20 year old Ethiopian prodigy Sileshi Sihine who won silver in the Olympic 10k, world champion Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge and world runner-up at 5k and world champ at 1500 from Morocco Hicham El Guerrouj. If Bekele wins, he will be the first to complete the 5k and 10k double since Miruts Yifter, also from Ethiopia, in 1980. ; Height: ~5'4 ; Weight: ~120 lbs. ; Date of Birth: June 13, 1982 ; Place of Birth: Bekoji, Arsi Province (Ethiopia) ; 5k PR: 12:37.35 (World Record) ; 10k PR: 26:20.31 (World Record)
