Marketing Department
The Marketing Department ('666'), is the most wholly evil and wrong thing on this earth. The marketing department is responsible for marketing the goods and/or services of the respective company for which they are employed. This career line, however, is so packed with those who had no idea what to do with their lives that the quality of such departments is next to 0 out of 10. The term 'Marketing Department' should not, however, be confused with the awesome Japanese 'Geniuses'.
