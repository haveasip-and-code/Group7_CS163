37
The single most random number between 1 and 100. Looking at Page 37 in almost any book you will realize it is so random that is ends up right in the middle of an either exciting part of the book or dramatic part. A highlight, one way or another. ; As said in Kids Next Door episode FLAVOR (find lost ancient variety of refrechment), there are 37 flavors of icecream! If that's not lucky, I don't know what is.
