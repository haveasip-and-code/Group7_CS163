b-shack
Smoking such an extremely outrageously big bongload that the smoke produced makes a temporary smoke shack that stops all sobrietarians from entering the premises. The only way of entrance to the shack is by producing more smoke to extend the shack. The word is derived from gnomes that dwell deep within the northern California forests.
