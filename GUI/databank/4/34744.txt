coleslaw
The other white treat, excellent with Sausage, Pickles and Beer or wine. ; Coleslaw can be made of green or any combination green/red cabbage. Done properly it's fucking delicious. ; Some coleslaw can be made with wine, such as weinkraut (wine cabbage), or if you're cheap, dunk it in beer. ; Contrary to the other two definitions it has nothing to do with the definers' mothers' unkept genitalia. ; Coleslaw is actually a solid version of an energy drink, it'll fill you up, it'll provide the 'gas' needed to fuel you inner God. ; That way you can be the fury you always wanted. ; Besides that it'really great with the right spices, just beware you bowels afterward. ; Ciao
