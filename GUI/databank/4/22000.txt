femaddison
So, there's this kid who looks like Addison Peek (who, it turns out, has a gay lover of his own [see Roy G. Biv]), only a gayer version of Addison. so Rollo decided to refer to him as Femaddison, and thus he hath been declared as such. I mean, Jesus, he wears a fucking scarf and tophat and has an annoying lisp. AND he's in plays...
