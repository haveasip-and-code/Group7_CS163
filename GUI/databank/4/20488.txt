The Price is Right
Thomas Hersh is backwards. If The Price is Right was only viewed by old people. why do they have specials for Firemen, Police Officers, Army/Navy/Coast Guard etc., and why is it that, when they just have regular shows, more than 60% of the audience is comprised of college students and people on vacation?
