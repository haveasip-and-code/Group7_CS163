Holy Hand Grenade
1) Monty Python: A hand grenade forged to smite the powers of evil. Instructions: Pull pin, count to three, throw. ; 2) Worms: MOST POWERFUL WEAPON EVER. Or at least the coolest. A parody of the Monty Python weapon, the holy hand grenade is an awesome weapon which shouldn't be reckoned with.
