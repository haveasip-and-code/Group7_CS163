kick down so i can get down
A term used on a grateful dead or grateful dead related parking lot in the early 90's and still found on parking lots accross the country. Soley invented by the enfamous Steve Burkemper before a grateful dead show on the parking lot. Ticketless and desprite he realized that holding his finger in the air to obtain a miracle ticket wasn't efficient enough. So young Burkemper came up with the catchy jungle 'Kick down so I can get down', which became an instant staple for ticketless deadheads tring to score a ticket.
