Nose Game
This is a game used to determine the order of something, much like drawing straws. Play begins when somebody declares, 'Nose Game!'. As soon as it is called, players try to be the first to touch their noses with their index finger. The last person to touch their nose loses, and generally is forced to do the unwanted task.
