friday speak out
A weekly friday gather of random thoughts. These thoughts are often jotted down on scratch paper and read aloud by the teacher. This was started by a teacher at Elk Grove High School by the nickname of K -Dogg. This wonderful weekly thing blossomed into a bashing on an infamous nerd who goes by the name of [fortman]. As of late the bashing has turned to another infamous nerd by the name of BoB, since [fortman] cosistently cries about these speak out occurences. DJ Jazzy is the one responsible for this abuse. His fellow classmates love his craziness and will hopefully go down in history for his friday speak outs. Some others who assist Dj Jazzy in the bashing include NGP,Lar Lar,The Mick, and the Rodamigo.
