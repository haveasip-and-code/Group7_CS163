magandr
If you're really really a tought guy and you have to express some biotches you ask someone if he has some 'magandr' for you. ; In most cases he doesn't know how to react, because magandr is a fictive word. ; He'll just ask you 'what?' and you encounter 'zzzssst' (sounds like the noise a fly creates) and place your fist somewhere it really really hurts.
