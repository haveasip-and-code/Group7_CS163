dullard
Boring, annoying and frequently idiotic omnipresent being that has at least one of its species in every institution. Usually parasitic and tries to attach itself to your leg and will lap up anything which sounds like praise that you toss at it. Master of inane conversations, highly sensitive. Usually has a need to prove its self-worth.
