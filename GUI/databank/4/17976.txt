Arlington  VA
Across the Potomac from DC, is one of the wealthiest counties in the country as well as the smallest county in the world. Known mainly for its cemetary and the pentagon. It is where some of the best schools are located, and everything within it is reachable by car in under 15 minutes, by far one of the sweetest places to live. In the southern part of the county, many minorities can be found along with sports fields. In the northern part you can find a mix between the high-rises, brick colonials that are identical to those next-door and mansions. It is where you take DC being across the river for granted until you move away.
