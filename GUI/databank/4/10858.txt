Riding Coat Tail
To sponge, mooch, free load, skate by, or do absolutely nothing but watch while somebody else does all the work and still somehow try to take at least partial credit for something you had no hand in. The act most likely originated back in Tallahassee in Apt# D9 and then fully cultivated to a personality trait on Calcutta Street.
