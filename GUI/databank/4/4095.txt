The Documentary
Incredible CD by The Game. On it's 18 track he exhibits an unparralled level of lyricsm, originality, Credibility, and word play not seen in any CD from any Rapper from anywhere in a long, long time. He keeps it real while taking shot at JA Rule, Benzino and The Sauce and pays homage to the classics. Un like most rap albums today, (Which features a dopey party anthem, and then ''A Joint for the ladies'' which is then followed by the purchase of Cars, Bitches, And ''Bling Bling'' Fuck the faggot that came up with that term.) Game shines alongside the presence of many including Eminem, Tony Yayo,(Who spits another sub-par verse on a G-Unit Album ,See Ain't No Click) 50 Cent several times, and Busta Rhymes. Best West Coast relase since, how long? He touches on every subject from His Dreams, His son, To the lifestyle he lived.This album is the total package **** Five stars.
