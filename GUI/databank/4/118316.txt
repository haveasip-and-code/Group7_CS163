Overcomer
A warrior, someone who battles no matter what task is ahead, someone that not only regains strength from his weaknesses but also sees life in a way no others can. Someone that doesnt laugh at racism, someone who doesnt feel pain, someone who has been through it all, and did it with a smile on their face. The true definition of an overcomer is a warrior.
