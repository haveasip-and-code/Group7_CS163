Quad Glacier
From the popular quarter-hour late night television show, [Aqua Teen Hunger Force], an attack in which the [Mooninites], [Ignignokt] and [Err] clone, then lock in forming an OctaMoon. Err is on bottom, and due to this his legs break. It disables the victims ability to see the next decade, so that they will never know that turtlenecks will come back in a big way. As the name implies, it is very big and does not move.
