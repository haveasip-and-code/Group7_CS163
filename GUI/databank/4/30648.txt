g-maf
A bunch of little punks (ages 12-17) who get into trouble and look stupid calling themselves a gang. These kids don't live in Philly, they live in the suburbs. They don't move drugs, they get grounded for bad report cards. (Aslo known as G-Mob -- See [Springfield Township High School] ) These kids are going to be the ones who grow up and pump gas, or work cement with Mr.D, or still live with their parents when they don't go to college and have a beat job.
