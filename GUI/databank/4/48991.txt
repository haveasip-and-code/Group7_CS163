digital matrix forums
Digital Matrix Forums ; function - noun ; 1: DMF: An online forum based on the anime and manga series Digimon, created by Vitros in 1999. It's existance spanned until 2004 when it was shut down after many closings and 're-openings.' The Digital Matrix Forum was place of vibrant community and lively debate and conversation until its latter days. DMF, as it was so often called, lived out its final days as small low-traffic forum home to but a few loyal members. Its place, along with that of Vitros's, is still one held in a fairly high regard among Digimon fans to this day.
