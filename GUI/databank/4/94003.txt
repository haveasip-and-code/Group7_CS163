Garboism
The act of thinking any criticism to an object that you love (but should not be worthy of such adoration) concerns you and only you. The garboistic subject thus takes it personally, and as an insult directed to him, which leads him to go apeshit and hate the critic. ; Note: Garboistic is the adjective of garboism.
