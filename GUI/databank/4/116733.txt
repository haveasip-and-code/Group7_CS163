a GREAT band. yes, they have done some selling out but who hasn't (ex: nirvana, black sabbath, acdc, and many others) Good charlotte is quite prone to change their style of music but i consider that creative. i don't care if anyone else doesn't like them. that's ok. it isn't about caring. it's about being happy being yourself and people need to quit being mean about it. Good Charlotte = don't be mean
