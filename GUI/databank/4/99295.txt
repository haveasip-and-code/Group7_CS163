Sh'mon
I would like to revise my original definition of [Sh'mon] as I now believe that it may be incorrect. My reason for thinking this is that I recently saw the [TV chef] [Jamie Oliver] greeting his friends with the phrase on [Jamie's School Dinners], so I now believe it to be some kind of [English slang] greeting rather than a sleazy variation of 'c'mon'. If anyone from England understands the exact meaning or origin of the phrase, please elaborate.
