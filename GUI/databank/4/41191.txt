Cracker Side Nacker
An Atlanta area gang started in 2004, representing the predominantly white area of east Atlanta known as Morningside and Virginia Highlands. The members recognize each other through the use of a hand sign in the form of a 'W' and wearing red and white clothes. The gang consists of all white members and takes pride in white heritage.
