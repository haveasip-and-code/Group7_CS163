Eggmen
Eggmen are a different evolution of Humans. They evolved from Neandertals and build a massive empire sprawling across half the globe. Unfortunately the Eggmen didn't like the cold, so when the Ice Age arrived, they packed up and left Earth or DOX as was known back then. They left hints of their race behind. One for instance was Doxian, which mankind has adopted and renamed English.
