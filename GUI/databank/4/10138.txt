three six mafia
Three six part of the hypnotize minds crew along with lil wyte. The three six meaning 666 mafia. They worship the devil, but have ill bass thumping beats. Three six tend to create raps that make you want to bob your head to the beat and go out and kill a ma'fugga; or pop a cap in a ho.
