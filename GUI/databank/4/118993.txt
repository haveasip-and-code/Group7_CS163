Bands with 'day's in their name are an easy indicator: Taking Back Sunday, Saves the Day, Thursday. If it was the 80s these bands would have been heavy metal bands. If it was the 70s, they would be disco groups. They would have been Pearl Jam in the 1990s. They all sound the same. Snottyish vocals, poppy rythms, lyrics that admit to being loser-ish. They bear no resemblance to authentic emo groups like Rites of Spring, Moss Icon and Heroin.
