hank williams
One of America's finest musicians and the greatest musician of country music. A fan of blues, gospel, folk, and bluegrass, he took wandering grassroots genres of music and made them into important musical achievements of our time. With hits like 'Hey Good Lookin'' 'Jambalaya' and 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' to name a few, he paved the country music landscape with his lyrical talent and fondness for American born music. A rockstar before there were rockstars, he abused alcohol and died at the young age of thirty.
