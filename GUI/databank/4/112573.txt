David Walliams
A pathetic excuse for a comedian, actor and writer. A one trick pony. A permament widow twanky. Totally void of charisma and originality he has tried his best to take British comedy back 10 years to catchphrases and sketch shows. High school kids could do what he does and most would do it better.
