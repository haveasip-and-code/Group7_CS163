Lobie
Armenians use the word lobie when they reffer to a low ass class mexican. These are the types of mexicans that work 24 hours a day and have no clue about how much theyre working for. They are also the type of people that u speak english to them and they just smile and say me name Carlos, you can spot a lobie i mean smell a lobie a mile away. Lobie means bean in Armenian...
