Nintendo Nsider Forums
A forum in which fans of Nintendo fans can gather to talk about Nintendo. Too bad that the moderators are jerks, and the forum is inteneded for little 7 year olds. The rules say it all. Why, you can get banned for anything not talking about playing with the Action League dolls.
