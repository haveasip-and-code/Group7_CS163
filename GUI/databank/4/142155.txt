tubercles of montgomery
The glands of Montgomery, or Montgomery's tubercles, are the tiny 'bumps' that are scattered around the areola (the darker area which rings the nipple). During pregnancy these glands enlarge and they remain enlarged while breastfeeding. They can vary greatly in number, averaging between 4 and 28 per areola. Montgomery originally described these glands as 'a constellation of miniature nipples scattered over a milky way.'
