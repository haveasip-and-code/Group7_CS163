Fahrenheit 9/11
A movie that an ultra-liberal millionaire director made to attack Bush for all his supposed 'lies.' He gives only one side of the story, which is the reason this movie is full of lies. The thing is that he contradicted himself just making this movie. Events in this movie such as the part with Bush playing golf makes absolutely no sense at all, because that was taped about a year earlier when he first became president. If Michael Moore knew what he was talking about, then this movie would not have as many lies, obviously. He is just making Liberals look bad, which he himself as a Liberal shouldn't do. To conclude, this movie was just propaganda.
