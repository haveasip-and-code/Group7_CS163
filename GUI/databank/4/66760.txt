Gerbil Smuggler
This term is born out of a practice known as 'Gerbil Stuffing' where after proper dilation of the anus (typically through vigorous homosexual activity) one man inserts a cardboard tube into another man's rectum. Once the tube is in place a gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) is tucked into the tube and plunged deeper with broom handle or an erect penis. The man carrying the gerbil is then a Gerbil Smuggler.
