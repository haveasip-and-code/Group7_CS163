spide-mobile
The oh-so-cool snazed up cheap car driven by 'norn iron's' rodent problem. ; They tend to be driven with bass speakers installed and at full volume playing the latest song (I say this in want of a more suitable word), oh, and shouting at people on the street, whom they wouldn't normaly say anything to unless they had 5:1 odds.
