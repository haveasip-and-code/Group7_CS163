Pennsylvania
A nice state on the East Coast. Pennsylvania is divided into three sections.. ; 1.) Philadelphia and the East are filled with snotty WASPs and JAPs who think that they're sooo New York. ; 2.) Pittsburgh and the West are filled with ethnic people with hard work ethics (from old steel mill/coal mine days). ; 3.) Central is an endless piece of nothing, filled with mountains (the Appalachian trail), and Penn State fans. ; The suburbs of Philly are by far the nicest places in the state, and even on the East Coast. Drexel Hill, Gladwyne, and Wyomissing are the best of course. ; The roads do suck, it's true, but if you put out the money to attend one of the many private or prep schools in the area, the education you'll receive is top shelf. ; And you can buy alcohol on Sundays. Also home to the second biggest mall in the country, King of Prussia. (Named after *gasp* the KING of PRUSSIA).
