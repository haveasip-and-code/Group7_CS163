n00b cannon
a large, powerful, fast firing/cheap weapon, such as awp in CS. People who use these are frequently the victims of tirades of shouts of 'noob!' and 'fucking auto-er! plz kick him!'. even thinking about using one means you have no skill in the game, and should crawl back up your ass. easily countered with a scout or knife from behind :P
