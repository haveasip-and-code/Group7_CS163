2017
According to Moecco, this is the year after the end of the world, meaning. ; 1) Another universe forms. (Ones that the current generation of humans and other lifeforms outside of earth will NOT take part of =( ) ; 2)A Big mess of nothing-ness stretching for an infinite amount of length/width/depth will appear. (Until/If another universe appears.) ; 3)God throws his 44th armaggeddon aniversary with all whom dwell with him. (While the suckers in hell must polish satan's nails all day and wipe his red ass.)
