bud buster
a bud buster is actually a coffee grinder, but put to good use. Grab some marijauna, chuck it in the grinder, give it some power, and voila, freshly ground buds(easy for rolling). I bet Proctor & Gamble would never have thought their coffee grinder would be used for busting buds(hence the term)!
