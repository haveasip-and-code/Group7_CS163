croatia
a country that used to be a part of Yugoslavia now its called croatia, a country that thinks they are the only ones in the world with beaches. The climate up there is to cold you cant even go swimming. montenegro beaches are much better and has a more warmer climate. if croatia didn't have a coast line they would just be a crapy third world country.
