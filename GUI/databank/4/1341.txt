Shenanigans
The name of a game played 24/7/365 by people who know of its existence. The game is played by first saying 'Shenanigans', then, the person who said it is allowed to hit or otherwise hurt anyone within earshot of them at the time that they said it. The main target tends to be the groin on males and the chest on females. People who are within earshot when 'Shenanigans' is said must say the word '[Mulligan]' as soon as they hear it to prevent being a target. If someone is hit either before or while you are saying the word 'Shenanigans' or after they have said 'Mulligan', you are considered to have cheated and they get a free hit on you. Note that saying 'Shenanigans' lasts indefinately until each person within earshot has said 'Mulligan'
