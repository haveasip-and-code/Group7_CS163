vroom
A badass drinking game in which you all sit in a circle and turn your head and say vroom. So for example: 1 person starts it and turns his or her head to the left and says vroom, the person on his or her left now had to turn their head to the left and say vroom to the next person, and it goes on like that, 'passing' the vroom. You continue saying vroom and turning your head to the next person until one person says skirt. When someone says skirt the direction of the vroom reverses. But when a person says skirt they have to look at the person who just said vroom to them. Meaning if a vroom comes from the right, and you say skirt, you face the person to your right that just said vroom to you. Now at any time, if a person messes up they have to drink (the amount doesn't matter). The rules are you cannot vroom a vroom and you cannot skirt a skirt. So if a person vrooms it to me, then I turn my head to them and say vroom, I just vroomed a vroom, so then you drink. Another way to loose is when someone skirts you and you turn your head to them and say skirt, you turned your head the correct way, but you cannot skirt a skirt. If someone skirts you, you have to vroom. You can vroom the person that just skirted you, or you can turn your head and just let it go. The last very common way to loose is to just fuck up the words, someone says vroom to you and you turn your head and say skirt. The beauty of this game is the drunker you get the worse you get.
