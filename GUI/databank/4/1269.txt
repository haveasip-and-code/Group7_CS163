rastafarian
Origins in Jamaca and deeply rooted in africa culture, this religion was the medium for those who opposed the oppression of Babylon, to speak out and live a rightious life as it is written, whilst beeing proud of their own roots and movements. ; Rasta eat a diet of veg fruit and fish, keep their bodies mind and sould healthy by staying active in global issues, and moving to brake the shackles of Babylons oppression. One method to this freedom is Ganja, which is believed to have gorwn on King Solomons' grave. Ganja lets the Rasta see what Babylon denies because of their greed and corruption. (Babylon refers directly to white oppression against the black ppl at the time of this movement; and now represents global oppression and repression).
