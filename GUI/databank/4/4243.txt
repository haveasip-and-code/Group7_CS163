nerfed
The term 'nerfing' comes from the online gaming world of [Ultima Online]. ; At one point in the game, the developers reduced the power of swords in melee combat. ; This resulted in players complaining that it was like they were hitting each other with nerf bats, not swords. ; From then on, if ever something gets made less worth while than it had been originally, it is considered 'nerfed'
