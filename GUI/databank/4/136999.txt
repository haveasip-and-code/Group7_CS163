Oh  What?!
A ridiculous catchphrase employed by kids who lack the intelligence to respond in a socially sound manner. Often accompanied by an equally annoying hand gesture, similar to the convulsions of a fetal alcohol syndrome victim. (A connection to which the performer is generally oblivious.) ; The phrase is generally ejaculated in response to surprising, extreme, or hilarious news.
