The Den
A place at Rancho Bernardo High School where all of the cool kids want to hang out. Only 3 are allowed. Many like 'the shit' frequent by there but fail to stay due to intense hatred. When [mormom hilll] is flooded the inhabitants try to flock to [The Den] but are killed, so fast. ; One had a dream about the area being called The Den, there is also a porn shop in New Zealand called The Den so the name stuck.
