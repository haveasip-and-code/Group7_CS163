om nom
An onomatopoeical adjective based on the sound emitted when something is 'oh so tasty' (either through hunger or flavorological value) that one gnaws through it without regard to cleanliness or etiquette. This sort of ravenous eating will often result in an 'om nom nom nom' noise being emitted from the eater.
