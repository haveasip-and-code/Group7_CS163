busted jump
a busted jump is a jump done by the band [busted], in which they hold a guitar and jump really high, bending their knees behind them, and often trying to hit a chord at the same time. Really good fun if you have to coreograph a dance at school and nedd to fill a few counts, just all do busted jumps!!
