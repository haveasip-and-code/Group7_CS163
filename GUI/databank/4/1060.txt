silence
The only true method of determining the level of a relationship. A silence in new relationship, where two people are just getting to know each other, is awkward. The less you know the other person, trust them, love them, the more awkward the silence is. Vice versa, a comfortable silence will only happen once two people know each other, they can just sit quietly without the pressing urge to break it. Then the intimate silence; a silence that seems intentional, timed and rehearsed to a third party but is completely impromptu. This silence only happens when two people can simply loose themselves looking at each other. It can only be properly broken with a kiss or a 'I love you.'
