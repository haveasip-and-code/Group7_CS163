eggsallent
the modified version of the exclaimation 'excellent.' Derived from the habitiually said catch word 'ex..cell...ent; so commonly said among those having a devious or sinical speech pattern (mad, insane, mini, evil scientists or surgeons.) Saying Egg Salad just sounds dumb, but once you start saying it you really can't stop sounding really dumb. So Eggsallent is the resulting accepatable word that can be salvaged out of that compultionary 'egg.....' with the latter, 'sallent' being just better sounding than salad, and still recognized as maybe being the original Excellent.
