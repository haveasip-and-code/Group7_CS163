TriBeCa
Way less of a corporate sell-out neighborhood than [SoHo]. Artsy and very family-friendly. Home to [Stuyvesant], P.S. 234, P.S./I.S. 81, ECC, and many pre-schools. Lots of expensive restaurants, an awesome park, and about 10 different [Starbucks] establishments. You can get there on pretty much every existing [subway] line.
