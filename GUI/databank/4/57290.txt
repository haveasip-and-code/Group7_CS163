Vineland
Largest city in New Jersey in square miles. Ironically, Vineland has the most trailer parks per square mile than any other city in New Jersey. ; Welfare, unemployment, race riots, gangs, drugs, prostitution, teen pregnancy, illegal aliens, white trash (black trash, brown trash and even yellow trash too! It's a rainbow of trash!), horrible schools, high taxes (for those that work and care about their houses), bad water, crumbling infrastructure,and corrupt politicians! ; Talk about paradise! ; Vineland makes Franklinville look good.
