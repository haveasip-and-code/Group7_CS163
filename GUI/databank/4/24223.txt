Fiero
The first mid-engined 2 seater made in the United States, made by Pontiac. Debuted in 1983, and the first Fiero came out for sale in 84'. The high potential little mid-engine sports car was cut in 1988 for many different reasons as people argue. It is still very well known today by Fiero fanatics, and by kit car builders.
