Kalik
A bahamian beer that is just straight fuckin' awesome. It has more beer in the bottle and a higher proof. It comes in Light, Gold, Gold Light, Premium, Premuim Light. Only found around and in Bahamas. A very good beer, tastes like Corona with more alcohol. Named after the sound that cow bells make when clashed together.
