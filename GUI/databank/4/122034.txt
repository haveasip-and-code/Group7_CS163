Frylock
Smoldering, intelligent, hovering anthropomorphic red box of french fries. One third of the [Aqua Teen Hunger Force] on [adult swim]. Only one of the three having destructive super powers - a heat blast from the eyes. Has a dark gray goatee and what appears to be a lightening bolt scar under his left eye. Wears dental braces which are seen only when he smiles, which is rare. Has a peculiar large blue jewel attached to his back, perhaps the energy source of the heat ray and/or his levitation ability. Has limited use of the fries as appendages. Frylock is usually the most rational member of the team, the comedic 'straight man.' A picture of Frylock with a young [Dr. Weird] (an ATHF nemesis) on Frylock's bookshelf, and an anatomy chart of Frylock on his bedroom wall, suggest early ties with Dr. Weird.
