Flombie
Flombie or the plural Flombies is the combination of the Flood from HALO and the Zombies from Resident Evil 4. Started at 8:55 on Feb 21st 2005 by a group of insane idiots standing in the cold before school. Greg was the first to utter the word Flombie and then the term was immortalized when Tim put Flombie 4 Life on his Intro book.
