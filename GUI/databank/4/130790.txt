bulldog broadband
A staggeringly incompetent, chaotic British company. They supply broadband internet connections and phone lines using ADSL. They are famed throughout the UK for making spurious claims about 8Mbit/s bandwidth capability; service provision times; ease of billing; accessibility and efficiency of staff. ; Bulldog was a small company that was growing slowly and doing well but then Cable and Wireless bought them out and did what C&W have done for years: spend a lot on marketing and too little on planning, anticipation of demand, engineering, and call centre resources to mop up the mess they were about to make. The result is thousands of dissatisfied customers who feel ripped-off.
