Clemson
A small college town in upstate South Carolina. a crazy town where tiger paws are EVERYWHERE (on the roads, stores, buildings, mailboxes, resturants, etc.) Was voted the #1 party school by many many magazines; On a typical home football game, the population increased by like 300% (from 11,000 + 15,000 college students to over 90,000) and every tiger fan in the state is wearing orange (**also note that the only 3 smart people in South Carolina live here)
