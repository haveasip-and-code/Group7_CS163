solar-puff
Solar puffing if a way to smoke marijuana using a pipe and a magnifying glass. When the sun is out, the magnifying glass is held above the pipe at a distance and angle that makes it shine down on the bowl. When it gets hot enough, some vapor will be released, along with some smoke. Many users prefer this method because it tastes better, and is less harsh on the lungs. It is comparable to vaporizing, but probably less effective.
