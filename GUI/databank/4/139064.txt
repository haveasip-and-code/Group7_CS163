ears with feet
A word used for people who go to the shows of Tori Amos, also somewhat synonymous with the word [ToriPhile]. Tori created this word herself when she was on tour in 1996. She doesnt like the word fans to describe the people who devote time and energy to attend her shows, so she calls them ears with feet instead.
