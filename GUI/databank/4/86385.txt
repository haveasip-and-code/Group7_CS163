common law marriage
n. A couple (male and female) living together without the benefits of clergy. The union is legal as if a ceremony had been performed by a clergyman or a JP. It is unlawful if the couple ever pass themselves off as Mr. or Mrs. or if the female signs something with the prefix Mrs.
