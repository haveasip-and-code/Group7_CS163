Virindi
Proper Nound: One of the many orginal monster species in the [MMORPG Asheron's Call] and [Asheron's Call 2]. They appear as legless, floating beings wearing tattered cloaks with long sleeves and a plain white mask, sometimes having a smirk or frown carved upon it. Long sickles extend from their sleeves when they attack and nobody really knows what their bodies look like underneath. Quite possibly the scariest creatures ever to be introduced into a MMORPG.
