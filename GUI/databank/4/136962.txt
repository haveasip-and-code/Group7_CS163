Whistle!!
A supery dupery manga all about the beautiful game (football, or 'soccer' to you yank types). Puts a spin onto football that most hooligan fans here in merry old england seem to ignore, like working your arse off just to get into your school team. unfortunately, because of this, they feel the need to throw racial slurs at foreign players during matches, and act all high and mighty, quoting such classics as 'I coulda dun that wiv me eyes closd!!'. The manga is about the story of a young boy named Shou, who, when he fails to get into his school's team (which happens to be the best around), gives up his private education and opts for a public school instead, and makes it into their team instead. Unfortunately, they suck. And, in their first tournament game, they are drawn against Shou's old school, the greatest around, Musashinomori High. They do put up a tremendous fight, an unfortunately lose 3-2. I could go on all day, but you should go read it yourself, cos it iz [teh] shit!!
