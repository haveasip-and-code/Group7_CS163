Maggie Simpson
The 1-year-old on the animated series [The Simpsons]. Constantly sucks on her pacifier. Once did what no one else would: shoot [Mr. Burns]. We see her as a teenager in the episode [Lisa's wedding], where she wears a pacifier around her neck and still doesn't talk. See [www.MaggieAndEric.com]
