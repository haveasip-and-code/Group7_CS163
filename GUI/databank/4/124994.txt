Hanshin Tigers
A shit baseball team based in the suburb of Osaka, Japan. More choke jobs than any baseball fan in the world can count. 50% of their fans are hooligans, while the other 50% are wannabe hooligans/bandwagon fans who only jump in on the very rare occasion when they have a good season. ; In other words, they're the Japanese baseball's answer to the Chicago [Cubs].
