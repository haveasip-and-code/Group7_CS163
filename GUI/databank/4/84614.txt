We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat
Phrase originaly used by well known actor Roy Scheider in the 1975 blockbuster 'Jaws'. He utters the line when he gets a good look at the size of the shark that is circling the small fishing boat he is on. Used in day to day life when a situation seems insurmountable.
