House Elf
1) An elf from the Harry Potter series that has to obey its master and do whatever is asked of it. It can only become free if master presents it with clothes. (Some house elves work in the Hogwarts school kitchens.) ; 2) Someone who listens to everything that his parents tell him to do, even bogus things like ironing a bunch of clothes, vaccuming a car he doesn't drive, fixing vegetables, etc. Some house elves have cell phones that go off at random times, always from the parent asking him to do a task, and because of his house elf nature he is forced to obey.
