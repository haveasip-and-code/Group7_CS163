Honey Monster
A large,lumbering horrific creature. At first glance it is easy to be decieved into thinking that this creature is in fact an ocean dwelling animal. However thorough forensic examinations have proven that this blob of lard, is in all actuall fact a land mammal. Terrifying as this creature may seem it is in actuall fact quiet and hermitt like. The Honey moster is without a doubt the grumpiest and most stubborn creature known to man. Once it has found a place to rest it will stay there for hours refusing to move, even if instructed to leave by a figure of authority.
