shitcreek
A fictitious creek, that has shit flowing just like water would normally flow. As a figure of speech, one might say 'I am drowning!', but if it worse than that, one may say 'I am drowning in shitcreek'. ; If one creek did exist, one would probably have more of a chance of living after falling in shitcreek, than a normal creek, due to the viscosity of feces being higher. Most people usually do not think about this, because it's not something you think about.
