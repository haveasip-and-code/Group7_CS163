Threetard
Noun. One step above conditional, behavioral retardation. The threetard, let it be noted, is not a variant of the classical use of 'retard.' Rather, one becomes a threetard through repeated indiscreet or moronic behavior. Therefore, the threetard monicker is one that is earned and is never in reference to the mentally handicapped.
