Europe Break
When someone ends a relationship because they are going to Europe and don't want to be tied down. Usually justified by saying 'it's not fair for you' and 'you did nothing wrong- I'm sorry'. ; Note: This is most ironic when the person dumped was planning on joining the other person in Europe as a surprise.
