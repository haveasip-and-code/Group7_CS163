Tucson
-A city of almost 500,000 people, half of them Mexicans and/or homeless. ; -Always tons of traffic because there are no freeways. ; -If you don't have a car, you'll literally die of boredom. ; -A 99 cent store at every corner ; -A place where I thought only University of Arizona students moved to, because no one else in their right mind should otherwise. ; -On the bright side, with low humidity levels (30% and down), the weather kicks ass.
