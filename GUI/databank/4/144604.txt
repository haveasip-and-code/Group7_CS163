SpiCracka
a person of Puerto Rican and Caucasian descent. After J-Lo, Pun, and the Latin Invasion all these Californians all of a sudden found out their fathers were Puerto Rican and shit, I myself had been discrimated against by my Mexican (common latin race in Cali) peers for being half PR. I made this term up years ago for myself to segregate myself from them.
