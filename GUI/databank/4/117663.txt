A very talented broadway actress who is currently starring as [Elphaba] in the touring production of [Wicked]. Has an amazing voice and can sing into the stratosphere. Very often gets compared to Idina Menzel as they sound very similar. ; During a rehearsal of [Wicked] in Toronto, there was an accident with the cables and she fell, supported only by the right side of her body. She had major tissue damage and is still recovering, thus causing her to take a break from the tour and miss the L.A. and S.F. productions.
