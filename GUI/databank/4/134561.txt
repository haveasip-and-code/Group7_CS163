Paranoia Agent
An excellent anime series on [Cartoon Network]'s [Adult Swim]. This follows a group of people in modern day Tokyo who have all been attacked by a mysterious boy deemed Lil' Slugger. They all identify the boy as having golden rolloerblades and a golden baseball bat, bent at a 45 degree anlge (described on the show as 'like a dog's leg'). All of these victims share the common trait of being under extreme pressure, trauma and stress at the time of their attack, and all of them have their problem temporally solved after they have been attacked. Each character has it's own sub-plot, and each character ties to the others due to the attacks of Lil Slugger. There are also two detectives working on solving the case. Paranoia Agent is a cerebral, vague and often confusing anime show, but if you take the time to understand the show's subtle plot clues, it is well worth it.
