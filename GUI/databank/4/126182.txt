Chat Gopher
When a person goes online periodically using a chat program to check who's online, usually ignoring friends of the same sex while at the same time annoying the heck out of every poor sod on the Gopher's contact list (because of the annoying log-on alert window). This can also be used for the purpose of seeking attention of people in the Gopher's contact list that are online. ; This is akin to the gopher on the 1980's movie 'Caddy Shack' sticking its head out of the ground to scope out the world.
