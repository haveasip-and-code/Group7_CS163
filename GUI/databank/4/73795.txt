topping off
(v.) to add additional gasoline to the gas tank even though the gas tank container is full. People do it to get the most bang for their buck, to have more gas in their car. This action can be dangerous and it is prohibited by most gas stations. Most gas station attendants do it anyway to sell more petroleum.
