Dr Condoleezza Rice
The most intelligent, talented, noble and stunning African American (Black, Negro, whatever) woman the world has ever seen. (apologies to my mother) ; It's haaahrd to understand her politics, her callous embrace of warmongering, and her selection of dumb and dEVILish friends, but girlfriend is smaaahrt. ; 'Go Girl' doesn't even't say it.
