Effexor
antidepressants, first you get headaches, then you can start feeling like you're not every full meaning you feel like eatting all the time meaning weight gain. Then the pill can also raise your blood pressure. Sometimes you get depressed after taking it for a year. It's also recommended to stay on for a year so if you start and don't have serious problems with it then you're probably going to be stuck with it. O and when you don't take it then you get really bad headaches or just feel like you have a fever the whole day.
