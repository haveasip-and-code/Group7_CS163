Palos Verdes
The town in which tennis moms meet for coffee at Starbucks and exchange the latest gossip, CEO fathers head off to work every morning in their designer suits carrying Italian leather suitcases, and teenagers in fancy cars, with music turned all the way up, drive to the top of the hill to start a new day of classes and social interactions. A place of cliffside mansions, localized surf spots, and an unnecessary number of golf courses. City council has control over how tall trees get, whether or not street lights are allowed, and the new pool in your backyard.
