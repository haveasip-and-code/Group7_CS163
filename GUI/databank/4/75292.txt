w00t juice
Teh [l33t] [h4x0r]'s [crunk juice]...instead of mixing an energy drink with an alcoholic beverage, one mixes an energy drink with preferrably caffeinated soda, thus making w00t juice. Called 'w00t juice' because it gives you the caffeine-and-sugar-high that makes your brain go '[w00t]!'.
