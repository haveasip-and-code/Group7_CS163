coast guard
A rather unique branch of the [DOD] that used to be part of the [Department of Transportation]. Generally involved in missions including: ; Drug Stopping/Seizure ; Envoironmental Protection ; Search and Rescue ; Homeland Defense ; I consider this to be a pretty valuable asset of the US military, but often wonder why it hasn't been incorporated into our [Navy].
