ebayer
Derogatory term used in online gaming (see [MMORPG], [MMOG]) to describe someone who has not earned the equipment or character they are using. Often high-level players will use [eBay] to sell premium equipment they have earned in-game, or sometimes sell an entire account, with all characters and equipment, exchanging real-world money for in-game items. This practice is generally discouraged by the companies that produce and host the games. Someone who has acquired their character or gear in this way is generally recognizable by inept game-play, which would not be expected of someone who has actually earned their position.
