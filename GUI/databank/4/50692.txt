Full Metal Alchemist
An anime voted, called, and said to be one of the best ever. ; Fullmetal Alchemist got voted 3rd out of 200 on http://www.animenfo.com/ ; In response to the question of which is better, Inuyasha or Fullmetal Alchemist, Inuyasha pales in comparison to Fullmetal Alchemist as a series that is dragged on, has pointless characters, over used humor, repetative plot, pointless filler and OAV episodes, poor endings and dubbing, sometimes shoddy animation, over used fight scences, and you get bored and can never quite finish watching all 300 some epsodes, while Fullmetal Alchemist has a mear 51 and has an interesting and absorbing plot, explained characters, well paced, and execellent animation, and interesting voices and a seamless intergration of drama, humor, and horror. ; Therefore, a better anime than Inuyasha. ; And I've seen both.
