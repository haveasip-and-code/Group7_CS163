Cebolla
Mainly meaning 'onion' in Spanish; however all of the cool hip kids are using it to describe a 'man' who is: an African American, extremely sensitive to insults and jokes, an idiot, a biter of their hands, interested in sucking a Mexican's blood, an Anne Rice fan, really annoying when typing, overstays at places.
