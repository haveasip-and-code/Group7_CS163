Forum Rat
A completely forgettable [message board] user. Somewhere there is most likely a factory churning them out by the thousands. You'll know you're in the presence of a forum rat when you read a post and get the sudden strong feeling that you've read the exact same post before. Main characteristics of a forum rat: ; -Infrequent or nonexistent use of capital letters and/or punctuation. ; -Bizarre behavior and use of the English language, which is often described as either [ghetto], [otaku], [forum female], [fanboy], or even [l33t d00d], or a combination of the above. ; -Avatar consisting of an [anime] or [video game] character, animated sprites from [Metal Slug] or [Final Fantasy], or the forum default [Homer Simpson] picture. ; -Username consisting of at least five numbers or underscores. ; -Huge, ugly [Photoshop] abortion of a signature which may stretch the page frames. ; -Terrible or nonexistent lack of personality ; -Completely worthless, typical, or irrelevant opinion on anything. ; Most forum rats are [preteen] kids, and often either a [fanboy], [wigger], [jock]. Though they come and go, no board is safe from them unless the [admin] only lets his/her friends register.
