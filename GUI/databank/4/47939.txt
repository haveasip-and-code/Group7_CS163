awesomo
The shortened name of the fake robot played by Eric Cartman on South Park: The Awesomo 4000. This involved Eric assembling two big boxes, a blinking red light, and a false speaker and set of robotic eyes, along with the name across the 'chest'. This was in an attempt to get personal secrets out of Butters, the pathetic-sounding blonde kid.
