late night
Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The best late night talk show, hosted by [Conan O'Brien]. Funnier than [Jay Leno], much funnier than [Letterman], and much much much funnier than Last Call with Carson Daly which is just a stupid show. The band is [The Max Weinberg 7], which is better than Leno's [Kevin Eubanks] because Max actually plays real music and Kevin's too high all the time. But Kevin's funny though and you have to be high to laugh at Jay Leno's jokes as much as he does. The show starts at 12:37 AM.
