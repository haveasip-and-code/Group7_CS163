robocop
1: A movie that spanned 3 sequels, with the 3rd one being the worst. 2: A cyborg part-man, part-machine, all cop, and capable to destroy the shit out of the terminator, and turn the T-800 into scrap metal pieces. 3: One of the late 80's best hits, even better than the first or second Terminator movies. 4: Former police officer murdered by a ruthless gang of druglords and brought back as OCP's greatest crime fighters, was temporarily disabled by a lameass dog terminator and later able to re-assemble himself with the best technology to totally obliterate Skynet and the Terminators. 5: All around kickass movie made in 1987
