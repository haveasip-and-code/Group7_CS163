Overkill
A freshman band at ASU that think they can feel better about themselves by preying on bands with more potential by saying that they're emo when that was their first show ever. Then Thoth was not death metal but now they are, and if you would actually read the lyrics you would know that there is no trace of emo in any part of the rhetoric. You have no idea what Thoth really sound like so you can simply just go and think you are the greatest band ever, simply because you need to to keep your minds off your tiny pricks.
