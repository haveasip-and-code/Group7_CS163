ramadan
It freakin IS NOT a holiday. It's a month where Muslims fast from dawn to dusk in order to better understand the plight of those who go without even basic needs like food. It's a period of abstinence - in ALL aspects, which means no foolin around til your fast is over. But when it's time to break the fast, y'all can pig out!
