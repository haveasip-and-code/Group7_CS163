french fries
Street slang for the perscription mood-elevator, Xanax (Alprazolam). Alprazolam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorder. While the drug is available in .25, .5, 1 and 2 mg doses, it's the 2 mg doses that earned this controlled substance the street name, 'French Fries.' ; The 2 mg tablets are white with three slices (3 scores) in the side, and the number '2' on one side and 'Xanax' on the other side. These score-marks give the tablets a resemblance to crinkle-cut french fries, and allow the tablets to be broken into 4 equal parts of 0.5 mg.
