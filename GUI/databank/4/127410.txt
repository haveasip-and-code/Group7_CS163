Bobby McPrescott
Bobby McPrescott is a term used to describe a person that tends to be whiney or high-maintenence. It can technically be used to describe a female, but most scholars generally view this as incorrect. ; This word is derived from a song by [group x]. In context, the word was used in a mocking tone by Hashmir who was reprimanding a kid, this Bobby McPrescott (actually Blade from the band), who was complaining about physical ailments because (as Hashmir deduced) he failed to eat enough cheese to be healthy.
