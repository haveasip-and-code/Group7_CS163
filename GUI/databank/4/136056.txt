e-rage
The type of internet-war between individuals which grows out of quickly-written emails containing statements that may be easily misunderstood or mis-taken by the recepient, and grows through retaliatory responses into massive proportions. ; Since email is unable to convey facial-expressions, unable to fully-convey emotive states or the status of the writer (ie tired, sick, depressed), is not interactive face-to-face dialog, and tends to be hastily-written, these misunderstandings via email are frequently based entirely upon mis-communication rather than truthful intent. ; Term coined by Louise Doncaster circa 2003.
