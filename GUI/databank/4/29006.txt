e-depression
Loser american kids (or wannabe american kids) who think they're 'depressed' and moan on about it on the internet all the time, via msn and chat forums/rooms. ; If they really knew what depression was, they wouldn't be on the internet talking to others about it. ; Usually coupled with poetry that's utterly shite and has a miserable tone to it.
