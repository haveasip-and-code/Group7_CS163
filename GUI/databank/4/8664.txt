game cube
A console thats often times referred to as the 'kiddy console' Mainly because most of the games are meant for early age groups. Often put down by XBOX and PS2 fans for its lack of games and graphics (in comparison). But we all know that the PC has the best in graphics gameplay and has way more games then any other console. Those who say otherwise either have crappy computers and/or cant use a keyboard and mouse.
