America's Army
A free first person shooter game released by the U.S. Army. It is supposedly realistic, but is in almost every way unrealistic. It is just Counter Strike with Army models. ; If it were realistic there would be no crosshairs. You would have to aim down the sight for good accuracy. BUT, it is all fire from the hip RAMBO bullshit. ; IF it were realistic, there would be gore and blood. Blood would be all over they players body from his comrades being blown away by an RPG. But no blood, no gore. Really realistic..... ; If it were realistic, firing a M249 SAW WHILE running at FULL AUTO would have ZERO accuracy. In America's Army however, you can kill someone down a fucking street. ; America's Army, while a fun game to kill some time with, depicts the Army as being a fun shoot em up thing to make gullible kids join. Good Job Army..
