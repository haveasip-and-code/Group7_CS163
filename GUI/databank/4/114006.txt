Malvinas
Now the Faulklands, they used to be the Malvinas and whoever said uneducated people call them that is not only wrong, but extrememly rude. Most Argentinans today still refer to them as 'las Islas Malvinas' because that is what they originally were...and should be. They belonged to Argentina and the British were incredible silly in wasting their time to take them away. The fact that they did is a lingering example of colonialism which needs to completely die out.
