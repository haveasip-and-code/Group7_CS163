birdy drink
Juvenile term for a method of consuming a drink from a community container (other than squeeze bottles) without said container actually making contact. The container's opening is placed just above the mouth, and the beverage is poured in. Requires a little bit of practice to avoid making you look like you have a [hole in the lip].
