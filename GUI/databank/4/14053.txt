Nigeria
A country in West Africa that is the lagest oil producing country in Africa. It is also the largest black nation in the world. The country is humid and tropical, but full of coruppt leaders that sell the countries oil to the U.S. and keeps the profits for themselves. They don't even bother to put it into the country. Just into their own pockets!
