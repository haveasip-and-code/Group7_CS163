annoying
someone who does something REALLY stupid excessively and even when noticing that the entire student body is pissed off whenever said person opens their mouth because they know something shamefully retarded is going to follow, the annoying person continues like everyone is their best friend. also mummbling and constant inward laughter are symptoms.
