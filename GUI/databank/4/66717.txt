super milk chan
One of the few anime amusing shows on American TV, or at least IMO. Chronicles the (mis)adventures of a foul mouthed, lazy,rude, 5 year old pseudo super-hero girl (the title character, who often says 'You Dumbass!'), a pet slug named Hanage (name translates to 'Nose Hair'), a child-like, yet secretly selfish robot servent named Tetsko, a dysfunctional family of ants, a gay onion/landlord named Laylo, and a man who is Definitely the President (of everything).The show is bizarre, sensless, and seems to have been done under the heavy influence of drugs, but slowly grows on you.
