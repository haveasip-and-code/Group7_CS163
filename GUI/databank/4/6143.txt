Gypsy Hypnosis
A trait commonly found in individuals that move from place to place (or couch to couch) promising money and fortune, but never delivering. They are especially crafty when it comes to eating other people's food and drinking their boos. One is strongly discouraged from letting one of these types into your home or car and NEVER, I repeat, NEVER loan them money under any circumstance. If you do, forget about any thoughts or attempts at retribution!
