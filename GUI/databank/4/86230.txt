Parkville
plain and simply Parkville is a great place to grow up. unfortunately it is now being dominated by an overwhelming population of spooks and wiggers. the true people of Parkville are the guys who play baseball and the guys who aren't good enough to play baseball therefor play lax. The baseball guys are considered preppies but we really arent quite rich enough to buy alot of those brands so we go shopping at Rugged Wearhouse and ROSS. Every guy at one time played for Harford Park Little League. The 'Heart of Parkville' is known as all the streets that surround the Villa Cresta Elementary Field. On a routine summer night you can find up to 3 groups of people pounding brew and smokin buds. If your from Parkville you either attend Parkville High or the select few who go to CHC. Even the guys who aren't wiggers know how to fight because behind every sooped up Honda youll find a baggy pants wearing wannabe thug whiteboy who talks shit and they gets his shit kicked. People in Parkville are not rich and most of them really dont like the richies in nearby Towson and Dulaney. In fact the nearby towson and dulaney kids are quite scared of Parkvlle. Our archrival is Perry Hall 'the sooped up car mecca.' The main sport in Parkville is baseball because it is America's sport and we love our country here in Parkville. in this generation Parkville has been dominated by mainly 4 families : The Baer's, The Price's, The Hearn's, and the Mangione's. Parkville may not be the brightest, best looking, classiest, nicest people in Baltimore County, but i garan-fucking-tee you we will kick your ass.
