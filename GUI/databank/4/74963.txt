shit and shove it
Humourous phrase relating to an exasperating incident. Shortly after 11 a.m. on a sultry August afternoon, Winky was riding in the back seat of the limosine as it cruised down the highway. He suggested to his driver, 'It's almost noon. Find a place to stop for lunch.' The driver drove on, eyeing the countryside with no rest area to be found. About 11:45, Winky said, 'Okay now, find a roadside stop for lunch' and the driver continued to search as he drove on. Around 12:45, Winky now exasperatedly said, 'Stop at the nearest stop. We WILL have lunch.' The poor driver still didn't see a roadside stop, so when they drove through a small town, Winky excoriated his driver mercilessly saying, 'I told you already to find a place to stop for lunch, damnit.' The hapless driver shot back, 'I've been looking and looking but honest... there hasn't been any rest areas!' At this, Winky angrily ordered the driver to pull into the little city square they were approaching. There, at theat unlikely location they all had a very late lunch. They then loaded the cooler back into the limosine and proceeded out of the little Nowheres-Ville in which they had their impromptu lunch. About a mile out of the town, they finally happened upon a roadside stop. After hours of hapless travelling without respite, the poor driver announced to Winky, 'Hey, there's a roadside stop.' Upon seeing the sign on the side of the road, Winky shot back, 'OH SHIT AND SHOVE IT!'
