gray area
A state of mind in which one cannot determine whether or not they are under the influence. Occurs between the drunken state and the hungover state. Symptoms may vary, although common ones are the tendency to talk to inanimate objects, wander aimlessly in empty malls, drive in circles, eat cereal at waffle house, inability to keep from laughing during a 9am class (even during a test), and paranoia regarding those around you.
