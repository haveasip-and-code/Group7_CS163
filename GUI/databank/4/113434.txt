no bull
Originally used as the tagline for a very cheap beef-flavoured noodle product which was safe for vegetarians. The phrase is now used to describe that there is no meat in a product. ; The sister phrase 'Ain't no chicken' originates from the tagline of the chicken flavoured noodles. And is used in the same way but only when the product is chicken flavoured.
