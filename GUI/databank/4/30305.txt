Seneca High School
Seneca High school located in Tabernacle, NJ. On average, you see more quads and dirtbikes rode to school then an actual car. The sports team should be playing middle school teams cause they pose no challenge to any of the surrounding highschools. About 1 out of every 4 kids is drunk or stonned every day at school. ; the funny thing about the school is when its near summer about the entire school is looking forward to there summer job of working on the farm or drivign there tractors around there yard for fun.
