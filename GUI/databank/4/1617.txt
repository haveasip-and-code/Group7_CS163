University of Florida
An public university located in Gainesville, Florida touted as one of the best universities of the south. However, the arrogant students of this university exagerate this status as the ivy league school of the south. Unfortunately, these students are delusional because their school will never be of the same academic caliber as Duke,Vanderbilt, ; Emory, Georgia Tech,Tulane,Wake Forest,College of William and Mary, Johns Hopkins,University of Virginia UNC-Chapel Hill, etc.
