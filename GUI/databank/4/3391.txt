rwd
R.W.D. ; Term meaning Rear Wheel Drive, opposite of [fwd]. Usually results in better weight distribution and improved handling for the vehicle because the whole drivetrain is not cramped towards the front. ; Also means that as the vehicle accelerates and the weight shifts to the back, traction improves. Contrast this with [fwd] where the weight shifts off the front wheels causing spectacular yet idiotic burnouts.
