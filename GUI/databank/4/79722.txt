desperado
A desperado is a kind of [joint]. When someone runs out of [weed], with little hope of weed in the immediate future, they may opt to roll and smoke a desperado, which is a joint made up of all the joint-ends in the ashtray, the scrapings-out of all the weed [baggies] lying around, and pretty much all the weed from everywhere that there might be weed. ; It's never really worth it - it's normally completely [minging], and it can be a bit of an effort finishing off a desperado because it is the pinnacle of horrible. It might get you a tiny bit [stoned], but you'll probably be so miserable after smoking something so horrible that you'll want to die. ; Actually, [fuck] it. It's always worth it.
