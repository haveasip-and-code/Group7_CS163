pulpy
A Yahoo chatter that looks eerily like an insurgent. If you look up, you might see a [pulpy] grinning from the cockpit of a jet headed straight for a tall building. Mullet-headed, breath reeking of cous cous and another man's asshole. With a flick of his hip he can yap on his mic [which he keeps securely stapled to his cockend] about the most mundane topic.
