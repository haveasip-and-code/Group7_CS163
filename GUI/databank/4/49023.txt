On the trail of the ever illusive M.Renard
v. to be out getting drunk on gin. In order to catch the crafty fox from French folklore one must visit drinking holes and order large gins as this is most likely where the gentlemanly vulpine will be found. Of course he is a devious creature and extremely difficult to find so many establishments will have to checked and lots of gin will have to be ordered. The meaning is similar to [chasing the dragon]. (There is always a risk that while you are rolling around on the floor of some dive enveloped in Mother's Ruin that Monsieur Renard will be at your house seducing your wife) This course of action is highly inadvisable.
