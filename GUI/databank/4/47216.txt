Michaelmas
Michaelmas, Christian feast of St. Michael the Archangel, celebrated in the Western churches on September 29 and in the Eastern Church on November 8. Typically, families gather for a dinner of goose on Michaelmas. The monday following Michaelmas is often the starting point of the semester at English Universities.
