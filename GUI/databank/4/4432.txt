mohawk
actually the mohawk was really introduced to the present time by US infantry in second world war to intimidate (dont really remember)german or japanesse soldiers when they charged or ataked face to face. ; then punks adopted as their own... and i guess native americans had it first... ; but now to many people do it... shame...
