Dan Marino
A selfish football player, who has everyone thinking he had no talent, despite he was 31th pick in the draft(to a SB team). They say he had no defense, but his defense had the name Killer B's(that's not a name for a sorry defense since it sounds cool), they said he had no running back(the truth is his HBs never got any carries), they always ranked high on pass offense(once again no carries for the HB and like were top 5 in pass attempts), and he tried to win a lot of games by himself.
