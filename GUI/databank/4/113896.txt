realody
1. [Parody] or [satire] that's so realistic you can hardly tell it's meant as a joke. ; 2. Presenting a real idea by parodying it. This type of realody may rely on making fun of something with criticisms that are so obviously wrong, they end up supporting the idea they appear to mock (see also [sarcasm]).
