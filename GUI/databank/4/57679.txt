doggy voice
A high-pitched noise, directed at any non-ugly dog within view of the doggy-voicer. Consists of: shrill 'Oooo da dogeeeeeee' and variations, low 'ohhh''s, squeaks, the word 'puppy' shouted repeatedly, and miscellaneous indescribable noises that are typically loud enough to hear from at least ten feet away.
