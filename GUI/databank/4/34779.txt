janitor
a player in a [FPS] (or any other multiplayer game which involves fast action and guns) who sits back as other players duke it out in a firefight, and makes an appearance after the victor of the duel is left with a little amount of health and kill him/her for an easy kill. Much like a janitor cleans up after a mess.
