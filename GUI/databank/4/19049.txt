Danger Manger
A nativity set in which several heroic action figures, such as [GI Joe] or [Transformers], have been arranged and posed in humorous ways among the traditional Christian figures. Usually perpetrated by a mischievous child on Christmas morning after having opened his presents, to 'try out' his new toys.
