Nismo
A sticker widely seen on the back of ridiculous looking cars everywhere. Usually mounted across the cars front/back window giving it that [badass] finish. Owners of these cars can't actually drive them without parental supervision and more than often end up as road accident victims. Can see paired with flame stickers and V6+ stickers. ; -see [idiot]
