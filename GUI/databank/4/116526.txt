concha tu madre
South american insult. Concha means vagina in Argentina and in the rest of south america is pretty much a shell. However, concha-tu-madre is an insult. ; It could have derived from 2 things: ; La concha de tu madre! = Your mothers cunt! ; or: ; Concha es tu madre! = Your mother is a cunt! ; Either way is a pretty good insult!
