cup-drink
Cup drinks are tasty, convenient and colourful. They come in bright pink (raspberry), bright blue, bright orange and many other colours. They come with a straw that has a sharp point at one end. One of the best things about having a cup drink is grabbing the straw and enthusiastically stabbing it through the plastic lid. Cup drinks bring happiness to the world. Indeed, I am partly named after Cup Drink, my name being 'Cup-Sellithaine'. My cool mate [Clare Atkinson] is also partly named after Cup Drink, and her name is [Rasthangatas-Drink]
