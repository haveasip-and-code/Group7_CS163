hilary duff
A blonde, corporate puppet who continues to embarass herself by spawning horrid music and Hilary Propaganda (brought to you by Wal-Mart and other fine retailers). Like other mediocre actors and actresses who were spoon-fed fame and fortune, she was easily able to obtain a record deal without any actual talent on her behalf. But with the help of digital altering and makeup artists, of course, she managed to be successful, at the expense of those of us with fragile ears and a decent taste in music. ; She has a relatively large cult following of pubescent fangirls, which began with her very cliche, ridiculous television show on Disney called 'Lizzie McGuire', in which she (attempts) to portray the stereotypical, melodramatic teenager.
