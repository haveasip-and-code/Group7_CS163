fashion slander
Oh you know! The kind of shit you see on people riding the [bus]!! Usually wearing something completley outdated or colours that clash and dont go together at ALLL. You know the kinda thing where youre tempted to walk up to them and SLAP them right across the face for ever thinking that they look good in their hideous excuse of an outfit. And then of course theres those people who think their cool trying to stand out wen they wear non-matching clothes on PURPOUS....and they....well theyre even WORSE....
