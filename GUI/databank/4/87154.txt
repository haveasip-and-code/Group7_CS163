indoor track
a sport that is often neglected and not thought of as a 'sport' although it is probably one of the hardest sports that a school could offer (oh im sorry i forgot that cheerleading is SO much harder...). It is quite similar to outdoor track and field however the practices are either held outside in very cold temperatures and in the snow (dont touch the snow) or inside in the hallways. The meets are held on stuffy, dry, sometimes banked (ugh) tracks where you sometimes have to auction off drawings to get a good seat.
