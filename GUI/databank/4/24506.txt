Bowling for Soup
Stop saying crap about this band, they make me happy when I am sad and they made me laugh when I cry. If a band has the power to do that they have achieved everything they need to in my opinion. I hope these guys make loads more albums cus even just reading the thnkyous in the lyrics booklet cracks me up, then I actually LISTEN to the lyrics. Good fun and hilarious. These guys are absolutely genious.
