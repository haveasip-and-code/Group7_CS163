wake me up when september ends
a song that's really emotional originally written about billie's dad dying, NOT about summer or sept. 11 or the war in iraq or katrina BUT can be interpreted that way if you want. ; a really great song but is becoming the next boulevard of broken dreams. now every radio station in the country plays this song to shit and every preppy poser idiot is screaming 'i heart greenday!11!!111111 this is teh bestest song eva!!!!!! im totally teh biggest greenday fan eVa111!' when they only know this song and BoBD. ; damn green day for being so mainstream.
