party foul
The new catchy catch phrase that everyone is just itching to use! Someone drops their drink? Be sure to be the quickest to blurt out 'OHHH, PARTY FOUL' and you win extra cool points with all the ladies, and possibly the men too! Practice being quick off the mark by dropping glasses in your own home! Try to train yourself to say it reflexively on hearing the glass shatter! Then open your wrists with a shard from that glass and try again! Repeat until dead!
