Mount Everest
The Mount Everest is performed by taking a dump on your partner's chest, then quickly turning around and covering your steaming pile of excrement with a large shot of cum. This gives the effect of snow on top of a mound of dirt. The name Mount Everest describes not only the act but also the difficulty involved in completing the act. It may sound easy enough to complete, however the Mount Everest must be performed on an unsuspecting victim. To date only one person has been credited with properly completing this act, for the purposes of this post we shall refer to him as Mike. The trick is to some how convince your partner to lay on her back (naked of course) while you stand or crouch over her. For this act to truly be considered a Mount Everest you must fully complete the act before she can react, it is suggested that you use oral sex or sensual massage as a cover
