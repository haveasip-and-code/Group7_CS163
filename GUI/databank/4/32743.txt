Avril Lavigne
Female pop/rock artist from Ontario Canada. Commonly hated by people who think she's fake or a poser. Like the way T.A.T.U. was first marketed as lesbians, she was probably marketed as a Sk8er punk girl by her management because when her second album came out she was dressed completely different. Same thing with T.A.T.U. Now they're no longer lesbians. Its all marketing.
