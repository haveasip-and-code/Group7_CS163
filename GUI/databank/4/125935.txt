Felon's Guilt
The type of guilt (remorse for misdeed) felt when capture/punishment is imminent. It's not that the misdeed itself is regretted due to realization that it was wrong, but only because the person is unwilling/unable to accept the consequences. Term comes from the colloquial and the legal system ('felon').
