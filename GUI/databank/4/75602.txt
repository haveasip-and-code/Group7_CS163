Utah
1) A state whose inhabitants, for some inexplicable reason, can all sing beautifully, are all musically inclined, and have extreme artistic talents.... believe me, it's true. Maybe they ARE following the right religion. ; 2) Home of Arctic Circle, fry sauce, and people who stop and stare at anyone whose skin is a shade darker than peach.
