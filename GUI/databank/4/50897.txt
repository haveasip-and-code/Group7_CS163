Romber
Slang for 'Rob and Amber', two contestants on 'The Amazing Race', Season 7. Both were previous contestants on seasons of 'Survivor', including 'Survivor: All-Stars', on which they were runner-up and winner, respectively. Probably coined by the fun folks on the Television Without Pity forums.
