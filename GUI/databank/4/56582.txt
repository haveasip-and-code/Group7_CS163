Douffe
Anything that is in aid of poking the tabbaco and weed concoction in a joint in order to compact the mix before twisting/sparking the joint. Usually thin, sometimes pin's are often useful if there is an 's' in the skins at the roach end. Best douffe to my knowledge - those screwdrivers you get in techdeck skate board packs.
