krua
Noun: derived from the drum'n'bass chant of 'lighter creeewwww!', 'krua' has come to mean friends, people, group, posse or, indeed, crew. In particular, it denotes a close group of friends who have bonded over the years through a shared love of music and recreational substances. ; Generally used without an article, as in the quasi-philosphical question: 'what is krua?'; ; Can also be used in an exclamatory context, e.g. 'battered krua!' ('we're all battered as a result of imbibing too many illegal substances'); or ; as a multi-purpose suffix: 'lighter krua!' ('pass me the lighter, blud') ; In short, very versatile.
