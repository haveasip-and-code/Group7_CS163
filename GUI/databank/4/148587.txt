Massaponax High School
This is the largest high school in its district. There are a wide variety of cliques ranging from your typical emo kiddie, to goth, to demi-gangster, to real gangsters. Though it is hard to find the real 'gangsters' and real 'goths'. The school is highly obsessed in school spirit due to the very good football team. The school has somewhere between 1500 and 2000 students and desperately needs to expand its building. Though it is the largest school the overrate this incredibly to much and just need to live with it.
