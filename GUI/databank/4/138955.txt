Schrodinger's Trashcan
The place where things that are lost go. You may think something is in the back seat of your car, but when it turns out it isn't, and you can never find it again, it's in schrodinger's trashcan. Lost sunglasses, watches, socks, anything. -source: reallifecomics.com, Aug. 18, 2005
