boyd rice
A noise artist and diabolic philosopher, known for his many recordings and writings dealing with subjects such as [social darwinism], [misanthropy], and general outsider-ness(for lack of better words:P). He is despised by the oversocialized PC Left, being a prominent member of the recent [unpop art movement] alongside greats such as [Jim Goad]. But despite all the ear shattering noise he makes, he also proves to be of many skills, playing melodic collaborations with [neo-folk] band Death in June. He is not the dark messenger he presents himself as either, as he has been known for the most amusing mass-pranks one has ever seen, including one in which he threw bananas at German hotel guests while dressed as a gorrilla in nazi regalia.
