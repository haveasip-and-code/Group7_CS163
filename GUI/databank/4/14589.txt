jamster
Annoying little shit-tard of a mobile phone/ring tone commercial company that has taken over the world and infected our homes and the streets with the ever annoying 'crazy frog'! jamster likes to appear on T.V every 2 minutes with its creepy necropheliac frog with a teeny prick and a retard helmet singing like a freakin grand prix race. Crazy frog (aka Axel F) has even made it to #1 here in Australia and in the UK music charts!!! (sad but true! ) aghhh...god help us!!!!
