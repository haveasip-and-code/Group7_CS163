IB
International Baccalaureate, an enriched High School program that's so special that it's the same all over the world so if you plan to do highschool in several different countries a year it's easy to adjust. It's special because you have no choice in what classes you take so the schools don't have to worry about finding teachers for electives, you have to do 120 hours of community service and the PROGRAM OWNS YOUR SOUL. To top it off, in addition to the super stressful courses you get to hand in an essay at the end of the year that's the culmination of four years of research and blood and sweat and if you don't do well on it YOU FAIL AND YOUR LIFE WILL WASTE AWAY TO NOTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO HIGHSCHOOL AGAIN SINCE THEY SUCKED OUT YOUR SOUL.
