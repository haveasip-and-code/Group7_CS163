John Fitzgerald Kennedy
35th President of the United States. Kennedy served honorably in the Navy during World War 2 and later became a US Senator. He ran for President in 1960, narrowly defeating Vice President Richard Nixon. Kennedy was the first Roman Catholic President, and he was also the youngest man elected president. His presidency was marked by the Cuban Missile Crisis and by strong support for space exploration. Although Kennedy had run on a platform that included racial integration, he was criticized for not pushing the issue strongly enough while President. Kennedy was assassinated on January 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. The identity of Kennedy's assassin or assassins has been the source of much speculation. One government investigation found that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone killer, while another investigation found that Oswald and others had conspired to kill the President. Kennedy's assassination was one of our nation's greatest tragedies. Many remember Jack Kennedy for his inspiring words and for the youthful and exciting atmosphere he brought to the White House.
