French movie starring the adorable [Audrey Tautou]. Even if it didn't have such a lovely, lovely woman in the lead role, it would be worth watching for the interesting bit players and unusual color treatments. But with the adorable [Audrey Tautou] giving an endearing portrayal of a [quirkyalone], and looking for all the world like the sweetest morsel in God's candy dish...well, it might not be the greatest movie in the world, but it is certainly one of the most pleasurable to watch.
