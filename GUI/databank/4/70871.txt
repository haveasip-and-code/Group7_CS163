paladin
A Class of Characters found in World of Warcraft which is only available to Alliance characters. The are in many ways greater than other classes found in World of Warcraft with abilities to wear the highest class of armors, fight with the strongest melee weapons, and use spells that allow temporary invulnerability and healing. This class of characters is hated by many others due to the inability to cope with the fact that he or she spent so much time creating a character who is unable to use or beat the paladin class. Similiar hatred is seen towards the Horde class characters of Shamans. It has been found in many studies that people who believe the paladin class is an unfair class often have a 32.4 pound stone with rough edges lodged in their rectum and decending colon.
