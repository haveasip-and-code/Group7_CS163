China Farmer
A China Farmer is a character within a MMORPG that is used for the sole purpose of gathering in-game currency, items, and other resources. The China Farmer is often employed by a Chinese Company that specalizes in selling in-game currency over the internet. Often times, the China Farmer character is played by multiple people so that the character never has to log off, therefore giving it the ability to always be gathering resources. Be warned that the China Farmer will often remain in an area for days at a time and will employ any tactic, including dirty, tricky and underhanded ones, to remove or discourage other players from gathering resrouces in that area. Also, be advised that the China Farmer speaks little to no English and will often yell at other characters in broken English or various dialects of Chinese. China Farmers are hated by the general gaming community for their ability to destroy the in-game economy and for giving rich players an unfair advantage over other players.
