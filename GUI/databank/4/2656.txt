the kinison
This band is not newly hip Garage-Rock, they are definitely not nu-metal they are just a brash, young group with a mind numbing sound that are more than ready to get in your face. One thing is for sure, the boredom they lived through in their native Illinois gave them more than enough inspiration and material to sing about and heave on stage. mmm i love the kinison
