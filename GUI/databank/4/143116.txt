shitamente
Spanish extension to the standard word shit. Mostly latin people mix their native spanish with the english spoken where they live, this is known as Spanglish. Example: Look, una church. So why just mixing sentences with two languages, also mix two words together! Adding to a spanish word -mente or -amente makes out of a adjective an adverb. So I extent shit to shitamente.
