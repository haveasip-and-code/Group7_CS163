fagernaut
A term combining fag and astronaut, stemming from the use of fag as a pejorative. Essentially the same meaning as fag, but with amplified meaning. Literally means a gay person, but as with the word fag itself, is often used to describe loser, idiot, pansy, or any number of generic insults.
