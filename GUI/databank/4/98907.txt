Alan Keyes
A bigot filled with hate, hypocrisy, and moral perversion. Also, he was a Republican candiate in the 2004 Illinois senate race. His opponent, Barack Obama defeated the low-life by a landslide. He is a religious fascist. His extremism preached intolerance, hate, and idiocy. His daughter, Maya Keyes, came out as a lesbian shortly after he lost the election. Alan Keyes then disowned his daughter and refused to pay for her schooling. However, justice prevailed as a good school gave her free tuition. Alan Keyes stated Christ would not vote for a Democrat and the all homosexuals are selfish hedonists.
