Da Port
nickname for Bridgeport, the largest city in Connecticut. Unlike the usual stereotype of Connecticut this city is poor, dirty, and extremly ghetto. if you live here and are in high school you probably attend central or harding and aren't very wealthy. you hate when people assume your rich because of the state in which you reside in. you also probably have a screen name such as BPT 4 lyfe. unless you have a brain you despise it there.
