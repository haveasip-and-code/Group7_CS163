ya done know
Of Jamaican origin. The literal translation to the standard North American English dialect would be 'you already know' or, 'you know it!'. Used (to the writers knowledge) mainly in Toronto, Canada (in its North American variation) where it has found use among the wider (mostly younger) population and, of course, in its original Jamaican patois dialect everywhere Jamaicans are found (that's globally!).
