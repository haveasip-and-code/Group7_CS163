Gangsta Metal
Obscure [genre] of [music] the emerged within the early 90s. Although some would consider this to be a strange combination it has been gaining popularity in recent years. However, the genre itself still remains deeply underground due to it's strange combination making it lose appeal to [gangsta rap] fans and [metal] fans. ; Pioneers of this unique form of metal into [Black Apocalypse], [Devil's Thugz], [N.N.D] and [Dark Heaven]. The Lyrically content usually consists of [street life], [black opression] and government [politics]. Although considered a mockery, [satanic] and a disgrace to thier race by by in the [black community]. Gangsta Metal isn't as satanic as the it am suggest, however, bands such as [Atheist Pride] have a strong view on the flaws on religion and that it is keeping the black race in slavery and opressing women and homosexuals. ; Think [Old Metallica] or [Slayer] instruments, guitar solos and enegry with [N.W.A] or [Public Enemy] lyrics. Gangsta Metal has attracted many black people who find 'normal' metal to be primarily white or satanic. Gangsta Metal often have album names that would appear to be regular metal with song titles that one would expect from rap. ; Subgenres of this type of music include Gangsta Thrash Metal ([Black Apocolasype] and [Decaying Silence]) Gangsta Christian Death Metal ([Children of Elohim]) and Gangsta Goth Metal ([Abrachasyn's Ashes] and [Veronica's Veil]) ; I recommend any fans of gangsta rap and metal to check out any of the bands below.
