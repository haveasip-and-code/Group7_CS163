Flea
Michael 'Flea' Balzary is the bassist for the funk rock band The Red Hot Chili Peppers. His playing style is generally slap bass, but has started using a pick in RHCP's newer songs. (his first time using a pick was on Parallel Universe) He's been in quite a few movies such as his role as a [nihilist] in The Big Lebowski and as Donnie in The Wild Thornberrys Movie. He also is one of the more tattooed members of the band. His current gear list includes (basses) his signature Modulus basses, a few Music Man Stingrays, a few Fender Jazz basses, which go through (pedals) an Electro-Harmonix Q-Tron, a MXR microamp, and finally a Boss ODB-3 Overdrive pedal, which (amp) are powered by three Gallien Krueger 2001 RB heads with a GK 4x10 and 1x15 speaker cab each.
