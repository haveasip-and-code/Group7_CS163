He Touched My Shoulder Story
A story told by someone in which they discuss their crush. The story is long and plotty, and the end is something along the lines of 'and then...he touched my shoulder!' - a moment clearly exhilerating for the person telling the story, but that leaves the audience confused and expecting more from such a long winded story.
