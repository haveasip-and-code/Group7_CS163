World War 2 Online
A massively multiplayer online simulation. Set in half scale Europe (so far only Belgium, Luxembourg, northern France, southern Netherlands, western Germany and south-eastern England have had towns and cities modelled in) in 1940, you can choose to play as Germany, England or France, in their respective Navy, Air Force, or Army. ; Every piece of equipment is modelled historically and accurately, meaning no hitpoint vehicles (like in Battlefield 1942... throwing a nade at a Panzer IV doesn't do anything to it, other than alert the driver that you're there). As the campaign goes on, more vehicles are 'researched' and introduced into the game whilst playing, such as the Crusader tanks and Spitfire Mk V for England, lend/lease vehicles for France such as the P-38 Lightning and Sherman tank, and the Panzer IVG and Focke-Wulf 190A for Germany. ; Check http://www.wwiionline.com for more info
