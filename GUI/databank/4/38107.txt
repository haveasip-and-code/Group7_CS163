J.A.P.
Jewish American Princess (a stuck up, bratty, or spoiled jewish girl) ; note: ONLY SOME Jewish girls are like this, not all. Also, some non-jewish people may be referred to as JAPS because of their attitude. People call others JAPS because of their clothing-JAP is INCLUDING the snobbish part.
