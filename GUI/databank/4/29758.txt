viking metal
An offshoot from [black metal] heavily centered in norse mythology and rituals. Viking metal is not satanic in nature because of this and deals mostly with Oden, viking warriors and of course epic battle (very cheesy stuff, but effective). The music ususally consists of more 'medieval' sounding melodies mixed with the 'dark' sounding minors typical of [black metal].
