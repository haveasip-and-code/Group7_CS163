Junquistador
An old, beat-up pickup truck driven primarily by undocumented Mexicans or Latin Americans in large city neighborhoods used to collect all manner of metal garbage and trash. Typically these pickups rumble through the alleys and streets on a predictable schedule. Many neighbors anticipate the comings around of these rusty heaps and remind each other to 'put out that pesky iron bedrail, microwave oven body or spare tire rim' so that these conquerors of junk can do their rightful jobs.
