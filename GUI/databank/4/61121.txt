Mina
1. A character on the often-overlooked 1988 cartoon 'Ronin Warriors' (the English dubbed version of 'Yoroiden Samurai Troopers'.) The series unfortunately lasted for ONLY 39 episodes. I'm surprised this hasn't been seen on [Toonami]. ; 2. Short for [Samina] -- a beautiful young lady who's a mild-mannered grocery cashier by day, but is a WORLD-CLASS anime artist by night!
