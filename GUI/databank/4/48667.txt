Mangie
A pretty woman whose diminutive size belies her ability to deliver a crushing blow to the unsuspecting. ; There is a lovely young woman at work named Angie. She is wee but feral. I once made a clever quip at her expense and, in retaliation, she smacked me on the arm. It hurts still. I remarked that she punched like a man thereby coining the neologism 'Mangie'.
