shnat
1. Used to describe a 'real hotty' that is often a mystery. She brings this about, herself. A girl who, with the bat of an eye can flick a guy across the carom board of life.. and if he's lucky, he'll hit the pocket. If not, then he's left for the next shooter to take aim.. A Holly Golightly of the mind: (see Kelly Bulman). 2. Love isn't blind.. that's only for fools who trip over it. When a girl is shnat, guys trip.
