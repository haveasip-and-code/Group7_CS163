Nev Gagne
Nev is a hardcore [goth] and she tells everyone about it in her profile. She likes to listen to Pink Floyde. If you ever need help with math constructions seek her help. But if you want to get work done in Mr Murphy's class, dont talk to her. Whatever you do, avoid the most hardcore of all Goths that she is. You wont get shit done.
