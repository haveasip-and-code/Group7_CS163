Go find someone who will shake you up.
Origin on the streets of Israel, used by the natives instead of the harsh 'Go Fxxx Yourself' phrase. This is basically used to point that sentence, while evoiding the certain conflict with those you tell it to, if one would have used the harsh 'Go Fxxx Yourself' phrase. ; In other context, can be used to descride a very difficult situation one can get into, and have no way out of.
