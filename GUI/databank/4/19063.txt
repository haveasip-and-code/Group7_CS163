thorpe park
The place where i spend all my time at like every good coaster enthusiast should.I wake up outside the entrance inside a tent and use the annual pass that i found in the bin to gain entrance to the park every day. ; The security men beat me with sticks and poor coffee down my tent every night.It's not my fault my house is right outside the entrance to the park. ; The park is home to the best rides in the world ever and whoever disagrees is wrong and deserves to be drowned by the mafia.Nemesis inferno is amazing. ; Alton towers must rot!!
