CYD
1.(N)-The underground musical sensation created by Jesus, Dimwit, and The Psycho Cracker. This acronym is the name of a band that is prone to completely nonsensical lyrics, flagrant use of 'niche' noises and badly imitated accents. Fans are usually under the influence of massive amounts of adrenaline and/or mind altering clothing. ; 2.(Adj)- To be completely insane and unintelligeble to those who don't know about or understand the band; but, to those who fly the crooked flag of CYD, makes perfect sense. ; 3.(N)- 'CYD PIT' A from of Mosh Pit in which up to 3 members are surrounded by a ring of 'Judges.' The members of the pit, or 'Tards attempt to create the most ridiculous dance or mosh possible. The louder the crowd cheers, the higher the score. The winner of the CYD PIT gets to pick the next song played.
