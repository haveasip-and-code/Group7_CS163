new hope
If you are a tourist visiting new hope, then you'll find it a pleasant town full of historical tribunes and small boutiques. If you're a resident, its quite the opposite. yeah i liked living in new hope for the first year or so, but doing the same things for fun day after day can get pretty tiring. If you live in new hope, all your going to find for entertainment is going downtown and sitting on ledges and making fun of toursits. You are constantly surrounded by men holding hands and motorcycles without mufflers. theres nothing but starbucks, alchohol, and drugs. some town right?
