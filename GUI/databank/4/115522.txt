good luck with that... yeah
This is a common sarcastic response to any exclamation of enthusiasm or joyous anticipation. It's intention is to present your general disinterest ; or disliking for their suggestion. ; Infact it could be said that the 'yeah' actually means 'no'. This is evident by the highly sarcastic tone in which it should be spoken.
