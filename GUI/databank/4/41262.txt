farker
Someone lacking the wit necessary for the SomethingAwful forums who likes to hang out with other knuckledragging, adolescent semiliterates. Poor spelling, poor Photoshop skills, and a complete lack of a sense of humor are a must, and it helps to be twice as opinionated as you are informed about any particular issue. It's also essential that you don't mind seeing the same retarded cliche catchphrases and images posted over and over again; these people haven't seen a new joke in years, and wouldn't recognize one if it showed up. ; You would get banned from the SA forums for being as unfunny and ignorant as the best poster on Fark.
