Echoside
A place 'worse than hell' according to fans of the rap group ICP. In actuality, it's more of a tag word used to sell albums to gullible children who have no identities of thier own so they dress as clowns. Also see [Insane Clown Posse], [Juggalo], [Juggalette], [dumbass], [childish], [pathetic].
