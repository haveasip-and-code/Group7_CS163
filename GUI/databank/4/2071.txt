coheed and cambria
In reality this is a kick ass band with great musical talent and an equally great talent for writing. In a fictional world, Coheed and Cambria are husband and wife in a science fiction story written by the singer of the band Claudio Sanchez. The story revolves around Coheed transforming into the Monstar after being injected with a serum by a dragonfly, and the fate of the universe rests in his hands. Claudio wrote himself into the story as the last remaining child of 4, the other 3 were murdered by their parents Coheed and Cambria. Claudio is now The Crowing or a messiah like character. If you are still interested, the graphic novels written by Claudio tell the entire story.
