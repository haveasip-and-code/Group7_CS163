Simply put, it is a person who never wins, or ties; just loses. Infact this person loses in various activities including sports, bets, fights, and most importantly, LIFE. Failing to connect to any serious definition of cool, a loser fails to interact correctly, or then chooses to blame their lack of interaction on personal views they say are deeply felt, aka 'I know Im a loser, I just dont feel like admiting it'
