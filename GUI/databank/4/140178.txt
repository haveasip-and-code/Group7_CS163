are we in love yet?
Sort of [emo]-ish shorthand for 'God, I wish I had a girlfriend/boyfriend' and is said randomly at a really slow party or spouted on a whim to the stranger on a bus next to you. (The last one is fuuuuuun!) ; Should be used when hyper/drunk/high/or just when you're bored and feel like shaking your best friend up. ; (can also be used as a charming pick-up line before youv'e met someone)
