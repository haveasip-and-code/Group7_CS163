longboard
A skateboard that is typically longer than a freestyle board. There are 4 main types of longboarding and boards are designed with each type of longboarding in mind: ; 1. Speedboarding - The goal here is speed, so boards are designed with stability in mind. They tend to have a rigid deck which is lowered significantly. They have large wheels and large trucks as well. ; 2. Cruising - The goal here is a smooth easy ride. These longboards are designed to be responsive and stable at low speeds. The decks usually have quite a bit of flex in them and are still long like a speedboard. They tend to have slightly harder wheels than a speedboard but still relatively the same size. They are very smooth and easy to ride because they bend as you carve, sticking you to your board as you corner quickly. ; 3. Sliding - These boards are designed for sliding. They are usually fairly short and have kicktails on the front and the back. They have small hard wheels that slide very easily. ; 4. Carving - These boards are designed to carve really tight and fast. They have a shorter wheelbase than a cruiser and turn a lot faster too. They have wide soft wheels for maximum traction. People usually use these boards in slalmom races. ; Many boards are also designed with 2 or more longboarding styles in mind. It is even becoming quite popular in many areas as it is a great mode of transportation.
