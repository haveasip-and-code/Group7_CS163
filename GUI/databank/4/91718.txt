Kevork
to attempt and/or accomplish suicide (derived from Dr. Kevorkian, the Suicide Doctor). First used at Riverbank High School in the late 1980s (Riverbank, CA), it was originally used in place of the dramatically less elegant 'fuck', 'frig', & 'freak' trifecta during times of adult supervision at school. It has since grown in scope and usage.
