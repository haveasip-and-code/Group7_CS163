telford girl
I am from telford, and i am a girl, but i am not a telford girl. Telford girls can often be referred to as 'townies' or 'chavs' and are the scum of the earth. ; They like to set fire to school toilets, and have their hair gelled into a ponytail so tightly that if the bobble found out the hair would still be in the same place.
