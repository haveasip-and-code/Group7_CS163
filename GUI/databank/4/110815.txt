Golden Ticket
Your period. ; When you think it's near that time of the month and you peel back your panties with that feeling of suspense and anticipation and then realise you have your period, then you've 'got the Golden Ticket'. It's kind of like the menstrual equivalent of Charlie peeling back the chocolate wrapper and finding a golden ticket in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, except slightly less exciting for the ticketee.
