beaubeaux
A french last name created in the long time ago by the beaubeaux forefather. He was an incredibly [savage] man who had six intelligent and successful children with his beautiful wife. This led to a re-definition of the last name beaubeaux to mean intelligent, handsome/beautiful, strong-willed, and kind. After his descendents left France to come to America, they changed the spelling to Bobo so the grammar-stupid Americans could pronounce it.
