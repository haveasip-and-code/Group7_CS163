celebriblogenator
The word was introduced on Kotaku (a gaming blog) in a December 07,2005 blog entry titled 'Want to know Madonna's 360 thoughts'. The word refers to celebrity impersonators who pose as celebrities by writing blog entries from their point of view. ; In short, a celebriblogenator is 'a ghost author assuming the guise of a celebrity through the use of a blog written from the celebrity's viewpoint' (quoted from Sederien, a Kotaku reader)
