The ejection of saliva directly out of ones salvatory glands and out of his/her mouth. The technique is hard to master. You must quickly press the tip of your tounge against the back of your front teeth, while doing so you must 'push down' on the lower part of your toung where the elastic-like tendon that connects the tounge to the bottom of the mouth joins the tounge. It is hard to do, but once done, it it's even harder to master.
