Boo ya
another word for, 'In yo face MoFo!', or 'I told yo ignate ass!' It's also considered a bad catch phrase from the ninties. A lot of wangstas (wanna be gangstas) use this term not knowing it's lame affect on the person who is listening which could result in someone busting a cap in that persons ass.
