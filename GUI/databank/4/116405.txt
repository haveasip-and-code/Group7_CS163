Fu Manchu
Literally 'ax qing dynasty'. Fu means axe, Manchu is shorthand for the Qing dynasty that ruled China before rabid nationalists took over on 11 Oct 1911. Thus, fu manchu is like saying 'cut off your pigtails' because queues (stupid pigtail things) were the symbol of the Qing's authority in their rule, all China dudes had to wear them as a subordinate thing. So, its very political, its an expression of dissent even. Hate-fuelled Qing hatred.
