Raw
Used to define a person or an act performed by a person that is of a quality that would require practice, but is then nothing more than natural ability from the performer. It is the opposite to 'institutionalised' which practicing too much at something (or taking it too seriously). Something can become more 'raw' if other things have been done to make it harder and more against what someone smart would say, like drinking before the big game.
