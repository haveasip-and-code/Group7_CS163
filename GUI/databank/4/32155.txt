red vs blue
A very poor attempt to make comedy from a game using clones of Master Chief. Horrible acting, here is why: ; Gus - A freakin' chinese 4 foot nerd. ; geoff - Pot smoking addict. Been doing it for 8 years. ; Jason - Likes to drown himself in soda. ; Burnie - A Texas redneck. ; Dan - Ex. hax0r for the pie crew. ; Kathleen - A wannabe slut. ; Joel - Only normal guy from rvb crew. ; Matt - Another Texas redneck. ; Yomary - Likes to fool around with Geoff. ; o.o
