AOLese
AOLese consists of slang that users of the [AOL] Internet service have developed that were once specific only to the AOL service itself. Many AOLese terms originated with the purpose of saving keystrokes in [AOL] chat rooms and Instant Messages, (for example, 'IM' for 'Instant Message', 'YGM' for 'You've Got Mail', 'YGP' for 'You've Got Pictures', etc.).
