redhat
Redhats are neither [whitehat] nor [blackhat], but a mix of both. Adapted from early RPG games where white mages used healing, protective 'good' spells, black mages used elemental, destructive 'bad' spells, and red mages had a selection of spells from both. ; Examples of redhats: ; - People who are hired to find security holes in a network, do so, but create new exploits in order to take advantage of later. ; - Someone who breaks into a secure area and then informs the owner that they can fix the security holes if they hire them. ; - Someone who works in network security and uses their job experience to take advantage of exploits either within their own company or elsewhere.
