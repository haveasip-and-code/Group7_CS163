Spice Girls
Possibly the crappest band ever, their songs sucked, only one of them could sing, the rest of them just shouted at the screen in the tackiest music videos ever, and ultimately one of the most mind numbingly awful films ever. Posh Spice, who has gone on to have the most fame, ironically does bugger all, she is kept to the background and given minimal screen time in their earlier videos and has the least lines in the film. At their peak, I hated them and found their popularity unfathomable, and now I rejoice that they have dwindled into an embarrasing memory.
