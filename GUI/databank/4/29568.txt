palestine
Modern day not-quite-country situated in and adjacent to [Israel]. The area is currently involved in a bloody struggle for independence from Israel. Despite what the anti-Israeli Western media likes to say, the politics of the situation have almost nothing to do with the Palestinian people themselves and everything to do with other Middle Eastern states (and some power-mongering militants) trying to get revenge on Israel for being [owned] in the Six-day War (namely Egypt, Jordan and Syria, whom most coincidentally lost the Palestinian territories during said war). ; For years the Palestinian Authority, the main governing entity for the region, was run by Yasser Arafat, a wolf-in-sheeps-clothing who clandestinely sponsored terrorism against Israel knowing full well it would prevent the peace and independence he claimed to desire. Of course, this is the same guy who turned down a perfectly good peace agreement brokered by the US and agreed to by Israel for no good reason so it should be expected.
