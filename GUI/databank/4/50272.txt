chi dubs
Comes from the word 'chill'. If you seperate the beginning and end of the word, you get chi-ll. The 'chi' at the beginning is obviously where the chi of 'chi dubs' comes from. Then, you have the '-ll' end of the word 'chill' since it is a double l, you just abbreviate this and simply call it dubs, a shortened verious of double. Combine the two and you get Chi-dubs.
