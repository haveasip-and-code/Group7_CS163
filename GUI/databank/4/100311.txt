DOS
An early [OS] (operating system), that was very simple. Programs were booted after the C:\ command line. DOS was later borrowed by Microsoft, which wouldn't exist anymore if it weren't for DOS. DOS was used for classic games, such as Doom, Wolfenstein, and Quake. DOS remains in existance and is used for gaming, without having to deal with Windows errors. A new version of DOS is hard to find, but with the most current and currently most popular version being FreeDOS, DOS users are still welcome to play their old games.
