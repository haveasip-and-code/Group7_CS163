doormat
A form of [nuthugger]y in which the [nuthugger] exchanges her grip on reality for an even tighter grip on a pair of nuts; the resulting effect being that without any concept of reality, dignity, or self-confidence, she is walked all over by the object of her [nuthugger]y and those around her who are disgusted by her [nuthugger]y.
