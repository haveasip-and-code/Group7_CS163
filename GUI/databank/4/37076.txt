Oldham
My hometown in Britain, outside of Manchester. Used to be a cotton town, now it is known for race riots and gang beatings. People fear to walk the streets for fear of violent assault. A history of child abuse in the mills, is now ridden with old people beaten to the ground. Possible Chav capital.
