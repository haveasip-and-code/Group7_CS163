turpentine cat
Term used by people of the Southern persuasion to identify something moving at a pace that borders on the supernatural. First seen in the 1920's when a group of men rubbed a cat's [cinnamon ring] with a dried out corncob until it was raw, and then wiped it with a rag soaked in turpentine. Can be used interchangeably with [raped ape]
