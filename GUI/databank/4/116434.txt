The morning after pill
Sometimes emergency contraception is needed to prevent pregnancy after sex - for example, if the pill is missed, a condom breaks or in the case of being sexually assaulted. The morning after pill is a form of emergency contraception that must be started within 72 hours of having unprotected sex.
