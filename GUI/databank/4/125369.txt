white cap
The term 'white cap' is used to describe a member of a group of [try-hard] teenagers who dress similarly; particularly by wearing a white baseball cap. The cap can be any brand as long as it is white all over and is worn with two special adjustments: having the hat sitting as far back on your head so that your fringe is visible and sticking out at the front and leaving the hat adjustment tag dangling down your neck. Most white caps also wear XXXXL nylon track pants (usually Kappa brand) and XXXXXL shirts (preferably polo). Lastly, white caps usually wear Nike sneakers (or similar), presumably because they need to run from the police so often after [tagging] public property. According to white cap mentality, tagging a wall is a form of art and makes them [ghetto]. Apart from their similar dress sense white caps or '[lads]' (as they refer to themselves as) are troublesome individuals who are even worse when combined in a group. Their saturday nights usually invovle going to parties they are not invited to and [gate crashing]. After being kicked out by bouncers and causing a huge commotion (often resulting in brawls), lads then roam the streets looking for people that are smaller than them or alone to beat up or [roll]. However, most 'white caps' are scrawny and weak, with little to no muscle tone, so often this hunt for smaller people can take a while.
