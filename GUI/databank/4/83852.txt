Indie Kid
kids who listen to [indie] music. generally elitist, white upper-middle class males who get pissed when anyone starts talking about music. they are obsessed with finding bands no one has heard of, only to claim they hate them once they make it big. ex: modest mouse, franz ferdinand(sp?), the shins. now only listen to music they found on [purevolume].com, or college radio. they like bands like Ambulence LTD, death from above 1979, and kill hannah. but not anymore, because someone else knows about them. general attitude of [punk]s, but less angry at the government and more angry at everyone else.
