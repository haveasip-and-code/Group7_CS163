spidergasm
The sudden rush of aggravation and disorientation felt when becoming ensnared in a previously unnoticed spider web, often accompanied by random thrashing movements. The intensity of a spidergasm may be heightened if the subject is not fully awake or suffers from arachnophobia. A secondary effect may be felt up to an hour later if the spider responsible for the web is found in the subject's hair or clothing.
