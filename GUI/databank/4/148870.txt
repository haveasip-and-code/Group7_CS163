meal Nazi
n. A person, usually a parent or older relative, who incessantly berates you during a meal about how skinny you're getting and how you need to eat more. They typically tell you what dishes on the table you should be selecting from, and they will characteristically even place food on your plate despite much protest on your part. Because they have taken away your freedom to eat in peace and to select food of your own choosing, they have killed what would otherwise be viewed as a pleasurable dining experience. (Note: meal Nazi has no direct connection with the more familiar term, 'soup Nazi'.)
