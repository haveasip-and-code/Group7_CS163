Mt. Carmel
Dude1 is incorrect. Mt. Carmel High School is being remodeled and should be complete by 2008. The school achieves great test scores and is rivaled against the relatively new school in Rancho Penasquitos, Westview High School. However, with the exception of the wrestling team, which is second only to Poway, Mt. Carmel has a generally poor athletics system. The school is pretty chill, and a great spot when you need to get some marijuana. Located in Rancho Penasquitos, which is in San Diego of Southern California, Mt. Carmel High School kicks major ass.
