Thanksgiver
Thanksgiver is a '[Thanksgiving]' dinner had before the actual day of Thanksgiving. It is usually celebrated by [college] students who have a dinner with their friends before going home to their [family] dinners on the day of Thanksgiving, or by people who have their dinner at an earlier date because they must travel on Thanksgiving and prefer to do it without an extremely full stomach.
