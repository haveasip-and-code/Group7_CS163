Apache
A Native American group from the Southwestern USA. They have different tribes such as, the Chiricahua, Mezcalero and Jicarilla. The Navajo were once an Apache tribe, till they broke away and became a distinct, separate group. Apaches were fierce warriors that were respected and hated by their enemies. Apaches still live in the Southwest and many still speak their languages and practice their traditions, but they aren't 'wild Indians' living in the bush,lol. That's just in old John Wayne movies.
