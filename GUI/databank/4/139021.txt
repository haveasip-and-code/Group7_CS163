Oli-Haddy
to be sweet and cute, caring and funny but sarcastic an 'Oli-Haddy' is a nick name which should be given to quirky people who are somtimes hard to read but have an endearing vibrancy and sence of warmth about them that you will always want in your life, and feel like u have always known them. ; (named after the great Oliver Ross Hadfield)
