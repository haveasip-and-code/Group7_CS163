Hollywood Scratch
When in a blockbuster action film, after the main actor has saved the world, killed hundreds of arabs/russians/aliens/zombies (delete as appropriate) and survived several other deadly situations, he comes out with only a small scratch on his face, which usually actually makes him look cooler, instead of looking battered, tired and pissed off like he would in real life.
