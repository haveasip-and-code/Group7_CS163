Strong Mad
A neckless, tights-wearing kinda-guy with few words at his disposal. Strong Mad talks in yells that are sometimes incoherent. Is not very bright at all. As his name suggests, he is very strong and constantly mad, except when accompanied by his best friend, [The Cheat]. His brother [Strong Bad] seems to have some sort of control over him, but that sometimes does not last. Earlier footage shows that he did once have a bump-like head, which probably became flat due to lack of use. Not much more is known about Strong Mad, except that he mostly stays at home, possibly pummeling other brother [Strong Sad], does not enjoy being filmed, and enjoys breaking stuff.
