Rutherfraud
A nickname adopted for Rutherford Birchard Hayes, Governor of Ohio and the 19th President of the United States; who allegedly stole the 1876 US Presidential Election. ; This was caused by the very tight margins that the polls have tabulated, where Rutherford Hayes (Republican) has only won by 1 electoral vote over the Democratic Candidate, Samuel J. Tilden (New York Governor). Whereas on the popular vote, Samuel Tilden had just won by over a 250,000 vote margin.
