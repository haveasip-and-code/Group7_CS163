FullMetal Alchemist
A kick ass anime show about the life of two brother, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who, after their mother died, attempted to bring her back to life. Their sacrifice to Equivalent Exchange was not great enough, so the Transmutation took Edwards leg and Alphonses body. Edward then used his right arm for material and transmuted his brotehrs soul to the armor in the corner. They now seek the legendary Philospohers stone, which allows them to pass the laws of equivalence, and get their bodies back to normal
