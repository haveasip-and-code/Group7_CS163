kick in the nuts
Something a girl does to a boy to either get her way or take revenge for a previous discrepancy. Despite the term 'kick' included in the phrase, it can be used to describe any method in which a girl uses her legs to gain a physical advantage over a boy, limited to attacking his nuts. She may use her knee or thigh to overpower her male opponent. Also deployed by males to males, but everyone knows it hurts more when a girl administers it.
