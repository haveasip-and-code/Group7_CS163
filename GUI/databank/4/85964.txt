pernitation
It's a noun, referring to the sudden sinking feeling one experiences when one realizes that one has forgotten to apply deodorant, and it is too late to rectify this error. The usage can be generalized to any sinking feeling and subsequent perception of peril due to a simple negligent act on one's own part, that affects you and only you personally, but not severely.
