mr. macphisto
Mr. MacPhisto is one of Bono's (the lead singer of U2) alter-egos. ; MachPhisto, portrayed at the Devil, is a washed up rock star, trying to give himself a dignified end in Vegas. ; He is The Fly, after the evil of The Fly (his megalomania, self obsession, lust for power) has turned into a want of money and legacy. ; Why Bono chose to become this character is confusing at best, but Mr. Machphisto did not continue after the end of the Zooropa tour.
