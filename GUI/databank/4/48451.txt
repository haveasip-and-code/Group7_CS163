huck
the action of assigning, or passing on responsibility for a project or task to another unsuspecting person. ; Although the origins of the term 'huck' are from the whitewashing the fence scene in Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, the term 'huck' was notably coined after another one of Mark Twain's famous characters, Huck Finn, just because it sounds better.
