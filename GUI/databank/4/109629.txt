Fuzzy
Fuzzy is the feeling after a night of drinking the next morning. It can best be described as knowing you're not hung over, but still not feeling quite 100%. ; Extra long showers usually help somewhat, but nothing but time will cure your uneasiness. ; If you think of a 'buzz' as a pre-drunk state, being fuzzy is the post-drunk state. The outlying cause is the alcohol still being worked out of your system long after you've awaken, one molecule at a time.
