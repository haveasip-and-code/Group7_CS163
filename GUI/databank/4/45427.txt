The Australian governing body of one of the most boring, repetitive and mindless sports on the planet. Players are encouraged to beat each other, and kicking of the ball is frowned upon (strange considering the redneck followers refer to it as 'football'). The only sport on the planet where an overweight, stupid and violent middle aged male can be considered an athlete. ; See hopoate for an example of the typical player.
