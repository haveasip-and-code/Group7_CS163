INDK
'In-DK' or stated aloud as 'In Decay.' Another crust punk band involving Ezra from the Crack Rock Steady Seven and included in the Lo-Cash family of music and originating from C Squat in NYC's Lower East Side. The band was short lived and only produced one LP besides their 7 song demo. There is presently a lengthy description of why the band broke up on Morning Glory's website (www.mglory.org), but in short it was mostly due to communication issues and creative differences. Like Morning Glory, INDK's music mixed fast punk styles with catchy ska strumming and clean vocals.
