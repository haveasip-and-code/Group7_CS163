Kogal
Kogal actually means high school girl. The Japanese 'ko' from kokogakkou (highschool) is combined with the english word for girl - gal, or kogal. The Japanese language doesn't have the sounds to properly pronounce gal, so the closest they can come is gyaru or kogyaru. ; These kogal all wear cute little uniforms to school and every Japanese man and a whole lot of non-Japanese men jack themselves silly fantasizing about these young ladies. ; In Japanese porn movies the girls are almost always kogal in uniforms hence the entry of kogal into the english tongue.
