poseur straight edge
One who begins to act [straight edge] for fashion, rather than physical or emotional health. Usually poseur straight edges can be identified by being 13-15, ages when most have no choice but to be straight edge, but few choose to flaunt it. Pen-drawn X's on the back of the hands are one of the only things that is similar between a real straight edge and a poseur straight edge. Poseur straight edges are essentially whatever clic the individual was before they found that marker, plus two black x's. These kids usually are not part of the [hardcore] scene in itself, but try to salvage their integrity by listening to watered-down, cookie cutter hardcore music.
