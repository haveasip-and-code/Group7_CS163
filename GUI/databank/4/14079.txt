circumfornicate
To waste time. A cute way of saying '[fuck around].' Combination of 'circum-' meaning 'around' as in 'circumnavigate' and '[fornicate],' to [fuck]. Usually good for a puzzled experssion followed by a chuckle the first time someone hears it. Akin to [circumflatulate], but harsher and harder to explain in polite company.
