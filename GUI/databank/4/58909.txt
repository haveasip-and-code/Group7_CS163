italy
A beautiful country with beautiful people and a beutiful culture. Hey Mccoy, if Italy had stayed with the Axis, you would be critizing them for being Nazis. Instead they overthrew Mussolini, and you criticize Italians as being 'cowards' who didn't want to face the Allies. There's just no winning, is there? I saw Mccoy's comments on Ireland and America. First of all, I gotta say I love Ireland. But come on! Ireland's major role in WWII was getting bitch-slapped by the British because the people of Ireland were supporting the Axis. (Ireland basically figured that anyone who was against their oppressors, the British, was their friend. Of course, Ireland didn't know about the holocaust and all that at the time, but still.)So don't go talkin about Italy's history in WWII if you're not goin to comment on Ireland's. I love the Irish, but I just trying to point out that every people and every culture has something it's ashamed of, so it's plain dick to go around thinkin you're fucking perfect.
