One of the best bands to have seen this Earth. Their music inspired, and insulted thousands. Their demise was met when frontman De la Rocha decided that enough was enough and everything they stood for was being compromised by their increasing fan base's willingness to follow them whatever they did. The rage spirit is still kept alive today in the band Audioslave.
