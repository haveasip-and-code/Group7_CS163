White Horse Syndrome
A condition in which a person's frame of thought in all things romantic is completely dream oriented and not grounded in reality. Fantasy lovers taken to the point of specifically nullifying all other candidates is the main tangent of this affliction but is also linked with the [princesstual] condition as well. Often hand in hand. Inspired by but not limited to the great gothic/fantasy/Harlequin/'Southern Gentleman' ideals in American lore over the 19th and 20th century.
