Hahaha  ha.
It started long ago in a Newgrounds topic and now lived on as a cult NG classic. Some idiot made a joke topic about Operation, called 'IS IT WATER ON THE KNEE?' ; The author's first post was 'A WHOLE BUCKET SEE!' and he left a tiled pic of a mustacioed man with a helmet. The first non-author post was 'Hahaha, ha.' ; Someone quoted that post and said it again. This forced a long chain of Hahaha, ha.'s. They started posting funny, strange pics after saying it. ; The madness went on for three whole pages until the mod Redcircle locked the topic, saying 'Hahaha, ha.' ; Many NGers jokingly fight for the unlocking of the topic, and lived in NG today. Many users try to start it up again, but get ban threats.
