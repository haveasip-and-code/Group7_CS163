Ol' Dirty Bastard
Brooklyn born Hip-Hop artist. Brooklyn Born as Russel Tyrone Jones on November 15, 1968. Formed the [Wu-Tang Clan] with his cousins [RZA] and [GZA]. Ol' Dirty Bastard was known for his off-beat, slurred rap style and humorous lyrics. Released his first album 'Return To The 36 Chambers' in 1995 and obtained commercial success with the songs 'Shimmy Shimmy Ya' and 'Brooklyn Zoo'. Released Sophomore effort 'Nigga Please'. Died on November 13, 2004. 2 days shy of his 36 birthday. Since then, many 'Greatest Hits' and 'Lost Tracks' compilations. ; Definitely the most courageous member of the Wu-Tang, with the most unique style of any hip-hop artist, ever. My personal favourite.
