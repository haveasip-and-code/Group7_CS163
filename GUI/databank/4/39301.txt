my super sweet 16
A new MTV show that documents nouveaux riche girls' 16th birthdays, with parties costing upwards of $300,000. A truly staggerring display of bad taste, eyewateringly expensive but ultimately pointless birthday celebrations, and ruined kids. Pathetically docile parents come standard, B-list rock band a $60,000 option. Seeing My Super Sweet Sixteen can be best compared to witnessing a freight train hitting a bus full of children or watching a suicide bombing unfold.
