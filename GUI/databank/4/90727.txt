magical trevor
Manic cartoon from the weebls website. Might even replace the Crazy Frog in my level of affection. Has incredibly clever tricks involving disappearing cows and pigeon sawing whilst mysteriously living 4th dimentionally in shopping aisles of Ragu or beans ; Seriously wacked, you dont need to be stoned to enjoy this - well actually you do, even tho he is ten times more slick than the last time you saw him....
