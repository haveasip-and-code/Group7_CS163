Light It Up
A great movie directed by Craig '[Babyface]' Bolotin! ; -A group of teens is bent on improving the run-down conditions of their high-school. ; -The best thing about this movie was not the action but the message that it was trying to send the message that everyone deserves to be treated equally and with the same amount of respect.
