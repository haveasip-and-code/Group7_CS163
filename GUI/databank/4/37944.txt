vacaville
City located on Interstate 80 in between San Francisco and Sacramento adjacent to Travis AFB and home to the California Medical Facility prison and some pretty good outlets. Also hometown of Papa Roach, baseball player Jermaine Dye, Nick Arcamone and Kris Goldstein, all great pimps in their own right. Also known as Lack-of-Thrill, Whackaville, and Cow Town.
