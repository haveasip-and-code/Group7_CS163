park ridge
an upper-middle class suburban town thats close enough to the city to get drugs easily, but far enough where you dont have to worry about being shot for driving that mercedes daddy bought you for your sweet 16. cops in abundance, they're always watching you no matter where you are. if there's an accident, you can rest assured there will be at least 4 units there within 2 minutes. no joke. and the best part... there's a starbucks everywhere you turn.
