disco 2000
Back in the 'Club Kid' era Disco 2000 a nightclub held at Limelight in NYC held a big wednsday night party, started by Michael Alig, a now convicted murderer of Angel Melendez. Michael owed Angel a great deal of money for drugs he had gotten for free and stolen from him. So 'Disco 2000' was no more after Peter Gaition, owner of Limelite was shut down due to drugs.
