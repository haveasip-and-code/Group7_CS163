bonnington
Normally a young student, female, who chooses to wear a variety of current fashions at the same time, thus making her look like a fool. In addition to wearing similar outfits to all their peers, they have an astounding belief that their own style is individual and hasn't been adopted by others. They travel in packs, normally in and around the Bonnington building and other 'cool' indie-type venues. Closest male equivalent is an [Aberzombie]
