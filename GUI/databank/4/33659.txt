beat bullying
A blue wrist band which is worn to show you are against bullying and show your support to those who are/have been bullied. ; Were available for free from the onelife website bbc.co.uk/radio1/onelife ; Its about standing up for what you believe in, not worn to be a fashion accessory ; I think it is sad that our school banded all forms or wristbands regardless of the charity or reason they were worn, how more appropriate could a bullying band be than in a school where so many kids have to suffer bullying everyday?
