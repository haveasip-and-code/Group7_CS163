fixing a bike
The term, fixing a bike, is a code word for giving someone a blow job. It comes from the event of one girl telling one guy, 'If you bring Colton some food, I will give you a blow job.' Well this one girl hasn't practiced this yet so while the guy was gone, I said she may practice upon me. Of course it would seem rather odd to do it right in the school parking lot out in the open so I told her that she can look like she is fiddling with the gears while I sit atop my bike and she can look as though she is fixing it but she is really just giving me head. The guy ended up not bringing me food. The girl got off lucky...
