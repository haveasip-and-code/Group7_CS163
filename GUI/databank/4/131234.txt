Spitter
A 'spitter' is a dose of drugs that is found out by taste not to be genuine and therefore spat out. ; For instance an Ecstasy pill that is distinctly bitter or causes tongue numbing or a cold sensation is to all likeliness contaminated or not genuine at all. Similarly a [blotter] which tastes bitter probably does not contain [LSD] and given the specific preferences of many users of [psychedelics] they are often just spat out with no second thought given.
