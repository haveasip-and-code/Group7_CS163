kemp
A pill form of amphetamine (speed) found in South East Asia. In Thailand, it is also called YaMa (horse pill) or YaBa (crazy pill). ; The pill is usually placed in a gum foil paper that is made into a boat shape. Flame is applied to the foil paper to get rid of carbon and other unwanted chemicals. The user then uses adjusted lighter to apply heat under the foil paper, and suck in the smoke once the pill starts to melt via a small sized water bong called 'Jo'.
