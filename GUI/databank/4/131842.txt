Paul Simonon
Extremely underrated bassist for the legendary British punk band, The Clash. ; His upbringing in Brixton gave him a love for reggae which left a definite mark on some of the Clash's work, and helped produce one of their most memorable songs, 'The Guns of Brixton', which Paul also sang on. ; The youngest of the group, he was known just as much for his bass playing as he was for his good looks during the late 1970s and early 1980s. ; Immortalized on the cover of their swan-song double vinyl, London Calling. ; Now resides in England and keeps up with his first love, painting.
