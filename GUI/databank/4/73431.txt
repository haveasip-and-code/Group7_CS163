whatever-time
whatever + time = whatever-time ; The total value of your [effort] and [time] that is wasted included with whatever means that was [used] up or given out to someone else under [dis]. (disrespect, disregard, dishonest, etc). This continues without your awareness from something like a [talk to the hand] so you remain unaware and they can come back for whatever from you again - over and over. You just give it up frivously until you become aware of the [dis] or you expire/[die] -- thus whatever-expires.
