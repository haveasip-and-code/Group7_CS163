Hotter than Balls
A cesspool of humanity - it is hot, humid, stagnant, sandy-soiled, fire-ant-filled, and swamp-like, with overpriced real estate - Florida is generally hotter than balls. The Spanish can have it back. What a shitty place to live! Ooooh that smell, can't you smell that smell? - (Lynyrd Skynyrd) Aaaahhh it's just Jacksonville. Our mayor is a little boy who only drinks water
