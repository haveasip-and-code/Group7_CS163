weakfish
A fish sometimes called a seatrout; found in salt water coastal areas along the Eastern U.S. seaboard. Look sort of like a trout but definately a salt water fish; called weakfish because when hooked and reeling in for a catch, if you tug TOO hard with your fishing line, you can break its' weak jaw, and therefore loose the fish.
