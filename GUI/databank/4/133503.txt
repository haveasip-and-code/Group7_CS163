EMINEM
Best white rapper ever. Started in Detroit by recording Infinite in 1996 which was only sold in Detroit and given out to record labels as a [demo tape]. Then he recorded the [Slim Shady EP] in 1998, which is basically a smaller version of the [Slim Shady LP], released in 1999 which featured the hit single My Name Is which was Eminem's first big debut. The Slim Shady LP was his first complete album that went out to the masses, which even today is one of the best selling albums ever made. After the success of the Slim Shady LP he went on to record the [Marshall Mathers LP] in 2000 and it too sold millions in the first week of it's release. He then recorded the album [Devil's Night] with the rap group D12 and although it did not sell as much as his solo LPs it still sold more than the average album. Eminem then went to record his 5th solo album, [The Eminem Show] whose first single, Without Me stayed on the charts so long that it had to be officially retired from TRL. After the success of The Eminem Show, Eminem went to make a movie, [8 Mile] which also had an amazing soundtrack which featured 3 songs by Eminem. Eminem's single Lose Yourself from the 8 Mile soundtrack was #1 on the charts for a massive amount of time before it finally came off the charts. 8 Mile featured such famous celebs as Eminem, Mekhi Phifer, Brittany Murphy, and Kim Bassinger. After 8 Mile, Eminem went to record another album with D12 entitled [D12 World] which went multi platinum and featured hits such as My Band and How Come. After the work with D12 Eminem went to record his next solo album entitled [Encore] which also went multi-platinum. Many people complained about Encore saying Eminem has 'Lost his violent attitude' and 'Eminem releasing Encore has ruined his fame and glory' but I myself believe Encore to be one of his best albums. What does the future have in store for us...no-one knows but Eminem promises his next album to be his best.
