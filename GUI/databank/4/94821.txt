Rusthead
Or a new metal head, not to be confused with a [nu metal] head, because nu metal sucks, we are a society (or at least i am) of [metalheads] that dont conform to ANY group, that would include metalheads. Metal ISN'T supposed to have a dress code. A rusthead is nearly impossible to dissern from a non rusthead because we dont conform to the metalhead stereotype, but we do like metal. Personally, this ironhead dislikes nu-metal, mainstream and especially SATAN. We dont fit ANY stereotypes...one thing that sets this particular ironhead apart is the dark skin. Every ironhead is different simply because there is no set status quo, because as a sub species of metalhead, we hate those. The dress code is pants and a shirt...accessories are welcome and ears are mandatory. ; We also like other kinds of music...
