ricer
(1)An individual who attempts to alter a slow, economic car by origin with the intent of acquiring extra speed mainly through HP/Torque fluctuations. The individual is under the false impression their car is fast when it is merely 'faster' and is completely cliche. ; (2) An individual, who may own a fast car or car with a little extra performance value than typical economic cars(i.e. SRT-4s, EVOs, WRXs etc) who perpetuates the same actions of other ricers(winning a race then hitting their hazards, cutting people off when 'racing', entering the emergency lane to pass people, using highbeams as a threat, pulling the e-brake to attempt a 'drift', peeling out their vehicle to 'show-off', ' ; grilling' or doing a 'threatening' stare while driving against or racing, applying more ricer-like modifications(stickers, bigger exhaust), etc.) ; (3) An individual who's core knowledge of cars is through mainstream sources yet is under the impression he is proficient with vehicles, especially imports(Hondas, Nissans, etc). This includes Gran Turismo/Need for Speed 'video-game' lingo like: Stage 4 clutch, Cold Air Intake(when it's not cold air), computer chip(when it's ECU), motor swaps(when it's unnecessary half the time), dropping the tranny(extremely dangerous in an automatic), etc. ; (4) Someone else who calls a person a ricer when they in fact are one also...better known as hypocrites.
