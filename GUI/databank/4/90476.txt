Misters Populars
An elite group of humorists hilarious alone, and even more assbustingly jocular together. This group has perfect balance, half being of one race, half being of another; half being left-handed and half being right; they truly are the most notable people of the century. Often referred to in abbreviated form as simply 'Misters'.
