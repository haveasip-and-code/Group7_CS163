l.a.m.b.
1. [gwen stefani]'s line of high end clothing and sneakers as well as bags manufactured by lesportsac up until the winter season of 2004. the bags came with a gold or silver lamb charm, one of the first bags to come with a charm. many of these bags, now highly sought after collectors items, sell for over $100 on ebay. ; 2. literally love.angel.music.baby. accounts vary of how gwen stefani came up with the word. some say she named her line of bags, clothes and shoes after her dog maggie, her little 'lamb', and she and lesportsac made up words to go along with it after the fact. others say they were her four favorite words in the english language, but this version is a bit fairytaled and contrived.
