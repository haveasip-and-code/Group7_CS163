Trap
The 'trap' refers to a situation in which a woman tells her spouse that she is using birth control pills, when in reality she isn't. It's called the trap because if the woman becomes pregnant 'accidentally,' the man is essentially trapped for the rest of his life, having to raise the kid and pay child support.
