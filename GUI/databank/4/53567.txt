electroclash
kind of ok danceable music made and listened to by totally pretentious people, mostly pseudo-bohemian hipsters from berlin obsessed with fashion but not nearly close to looking good (wannabe-girls in their 30's with choppy 80's do and 80's thrift store clothing). they think it's very original to scream 'kreuzberg' to a minimal beat.
