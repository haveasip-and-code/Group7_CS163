Ol' Shotty
The most prized posession of Boots. Ol' Shotty is Boots' shotgun that he uses to blow his nuts off in the shed. Without Ol' Shotty, Boots would have to just let anybody go into the fridge and people would never have to state their business. Ol' Shotty is a creation of two fat kids that have nothing better to do than make fun of people that make you laugh by just looking at them.
