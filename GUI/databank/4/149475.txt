The Opium Den
A well-known sophomore 'party suite' in Yale University's Jonathan Edwards College. It was started in August, 2005 by a group of three pioneering students from the Class of 2008. The suite is best known for its 'DENbauchery' parties, which occur weekly on Thursday nights. The distinguishing characteristics of The Opium Den include its antique tapestries and wall-decor, some of which are on loan from the extensive textile collection of noted Asian art collector Merrill Sherwin. Also called the 'Den' for short, its members often collaborate on both philanthropic and cultural activities. The tradition of The Opium Den shall carry on until Jonathan Edwards College is renovated during the 2007-2008 academic year.
