My dick and balls are out.
A response to someone telling you about their nerdy accomplishments, but only if said accomplishments involve numbers. This response has the dual purpose of freaking the person out to stop them from telling you their nerdy thing, and telling them your own accomplishment. ; NOTE: One's personal dick and balls do NOT have to be out to say this, nor does one even have to be male.
