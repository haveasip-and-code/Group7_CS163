Sensipets
Simply, Sensipets is an online virtual pet site. ; History: ; In the begining, there was [Neopets]. It was formerly a very entertaining pet RPG site, with a thriving message board known as the GC. ; Then, TNP (The Neopets Team) got greedy, and everything began to slide downhill. Today, overcommercialization runs rampant, the games have become trite, and the GC is effectively dead. ; Sensipets.com is seen by many as the reincarnation of the old spirit of Neopets. There, users will encounter a simple and engaging enviroment, as well as active and friendly message boards. ; I consider the relationship between [Neopets] and [Sensipets] to be akin to [Internet Explorer] and [Firefox] ([Mozilla]).
