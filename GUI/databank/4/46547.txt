Prep
A prep is not someone who shops at Abercrombie, Hollister, and American Eagle. We shop at JCrew, Polo, Lilly Pulitzer, Neimans, CK bradley, eliza b., Vineyard Vines, Rainbow, and North Face. We carry bags from Herve Chapelier, longchamp, and chanel:Classic and Pretty. Pearls are neccesary and jewlery from tiffany is needed. If you cannot afford those brands you are not a prep. Usually we go to elite private schools and end up in ivy league colleges. A common misconception is that all preps are blond, definitly not true. Most of us preps vacation in Block Island, Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Nantucket, and the Hamptons. Really preppy towns include: Greenwich CT, and Rye NY. Prep for life.
