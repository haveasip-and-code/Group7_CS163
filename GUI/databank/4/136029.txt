Darwinism
A semi-scientific philosophy which claims that all life exists as a result of highly improbable circumstances and haphazard mutations a.k.a. 'hopeful monsters.' Darwinists have a tendency to proclaim that Darwinian evolution can account for everything (frog to a prince) while also appealing to ignorance in the face of massive gaps in their philosophy. ; Darwinism is closely related to naturalism.
