fXc
A term used in reference to a group of kids usually 14-24. Short for 'fashioncore'. Said kids are similar to the '[hardcore]' kids but with shallower taste in music and more emphasis on the fashionable part of looking hardcore. ; eg. boys in girl jeans, white studded belts and too-tight band shirts
