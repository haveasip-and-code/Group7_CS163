colonic
The burning, uncontrollable flow of ass water and acidic shit that exits your colon while burning your asshole (aka: [ass piss]). A mixture of this \'ass piss\' and bowl water may also backsplash onto your cheeks...this usually depends on the force of the colonic and consistency of the \'ass piss\'. ; The telltale sign of an impending colonic is a spur of the moment sensation that you are going to uncontrollably piss out of your ass into your pants. ; You will know someone has these symptoms when you observe them making a mad dash for the bathroom, while trying to take down their pants. ; WARNING: the side effects of a colonic are as follows (most severe first): Burning asshole (can last for 24 hours), wet ass cheeks (can make your boxers wet if you don't wipe well), and shaky/weak legs (caused by the stress and pain of colonic). ; Can also be called: [explosive diarrhea]
