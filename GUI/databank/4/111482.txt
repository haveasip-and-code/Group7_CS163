octopi
An incorrect pluralization of octopus. Widly accepted by the public, Octopi is the word that most people use. Some people will argue that the proper pluralization is Octopodes, however most biologists will agree that the correct pluralization is Octopuses. (Ref. Sciencs Mag; Vol 307, 25 March 2005)
