X-files
A show that used to be on t.v about a man named Fox Mulder who when he was 10 years old had his 8 year old sister abducted by aliens in his living room and since then he has always been trying to prove the existance of extraterrestrial life on earth and/or the universe. When the series began Agent Mulder was already in a position at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was working in a section called the 'X-files' which investigated into the paranormal. An agent named Dana Scully was assigned to the 'X-files' along with agent Mulder to help him with his work, but at first it was thought by Agent Mulder that she was there to spy on and to debunk his work, but over time he began to trust her and they became close. The show ran for 9 seasons on t.v and was quite popular with [cyberpunks] and paranoid people.
