deloitte
1) a place where you can work in exchange for money, and if you don't like working there, you can leave to make money somewhere else. 2) a place where you can have a career and make a whole lot of money if you think that is the right path for you. 3) a place that is not perfect, like every other workplace. 4) a place where you can either complain to yourself or others or actually try to engage with people to make it a better place.
