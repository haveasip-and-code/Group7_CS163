gg lag
Word combination used by one player in particular known as '[Inacurate].' A combination born from the seemingly 'necessity' of league games to always end with players saying '[gg]' regardless if it was or not, and the term '[lag]' used by most players to reference the fact that they did not die to skill, but in fact a network discrepancy.
