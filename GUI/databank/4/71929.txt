wicca
A religeon based on the worship of a Goddess and a God. Though Wiccans claim their religeon is thousands of years old, it was in fact invented in the late 1940s or early 1950s by Mr. Gerald Gardner, though admittedly he did incorporate numerous elements from diverse ancient beliefs. ; A fact hotly denied by Wiccans is the fact that Wicca seems to have originally been intended as a European branch of Thelema, the religeon of [Aleister Crowley]. Indeed, Gardner's original works include large chunks cribbed from Crowley, but these were later removed in order to distance the Craft from the Antichrist.
