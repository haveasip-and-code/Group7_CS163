bmx
sweetest sport ever, I love it, and I will do anything to make that seen, I hate fucking skaters (all but a select few) and their way of life, if you agree with me, check out my definition of [skater] it's number 2... I fucken love this sport, you can do anything at all with it, take it where you want, it comes in many sorts, flat, dirt, street(the ones that I ride) and park and vert..., I would ride park, except the skaters always give me such a fucking staring, I leave after about 15 minutes... I suppose its cos they know that I have a dick and they don't, lol!!!
