Revelation
Term sometimes used to discount the importance of human attachment to the worldly (i.e. physical, mental, social.) Where something is lacking spiritual substance or some element of 'goodness', it is said to lack revelation. Relates to the final book of the Holy Bible, where all will be 'revealed in time.'
