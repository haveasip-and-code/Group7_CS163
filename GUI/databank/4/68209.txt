Winston-Salem
City of about 150,000 in West-Central North Carolina. It started as a [tobacco] town, and is the home or R.J. Reynolds Tobacco--makers of Camel, Winston and Salem cigarettes. Also famous for being the home of [Wake Forest University] and North Carolina School of the Arts. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts also started here about 70 years ago. ; The home to one of two surviving Moravian communities in the country, and the Old Salem historical district is literally a 18th-Century town in the middle of the city. ; Still very much a small southern town; city government has a fear of expansion and growth, and the 'good old boys' still run things.
