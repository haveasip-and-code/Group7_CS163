Katamari Damacy
The most kick ass game ever. The name actually isn't Japanese, but is a misspelling of 'Calamari Democracy', which is English for 'government based on squids'. ; The story is fascinating. The King of All Cosmos (or in other words, God) gets drunk one nights and eats all the stars. In an attempt to fix things before his wife gets back, he calls up his bastard son Prince(you) and tells him to go down to Earth and roll up anything he can find(including children)into a ball, which will then be compressed into a star. The King of All Cosmos is sometimes not impressed with your hard work and will yell at you and make you cry as you lay ready to die from exhaustion. ; The King also throws up rainbows and thinks all of your cousins are disturbing.
