pick
A piece of metal or plastic to accurately pick strings on a guitar bass or banjo. Kids you see in High School that play guitars in the hallways abandon guitar picks because they are soo good and dont need picks, and is just a way for other people to say wow, that kid is sooo good at the guitar he plays doesnt even need a pick!
