fanboy
Fun info from the comic book legend John Byrne's site FAQ. ; Did JB coin the phrase 'fanboy'? ; JB: The earliest use of the word 'fanboy' of which I am aware was in the 'Obligatory New Pages' of Jim Engle and Chuck Fiala's FANDOM CONFIDENTIAL collection (from the pages of 'The Comic Reader'.) In a scene in which Jim and Chuck collapse into paroxysms of mindless adoration because they have been in the room with me for more than five minutes, Jim had me refer to them as 'a couple of fanboys in bondage'.
