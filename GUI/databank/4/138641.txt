Quixtar-like
Greedy, money-hungry, describing people who fall for scams and pyramid schemes such as Quixtar and Amway (the failed version of Quixtar). Describing people who will pay $100 to attend a pointless rally where they will hold candles and listen to greed-driven liars speak. Describing people who have the desire to become rich quickly, only to become broke later in life.
