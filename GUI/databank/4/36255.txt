A wolf, Coloradonian to be precise, lives in the natural setting of any computer loving canid, the basement. During the day this canid may be found sleeping in it's den, or maybe out and about it's native enviorment. At night this canid may be found anywhere as it is nocternal by nature. And does much travels, even using it's power it can travel around the world as a datapacket on the plains of Internet.
