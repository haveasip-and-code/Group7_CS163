pokolo
Word to describe lonelieness, originated in 1998 when a couple of friends from Fresno, California decided to come up with a word to describe how lonely they felt. One of the gang, Chris, later commited suicide because he felt the world was a hoax, and actually used the word 'pokolo' in his goodbye note.
