mids
Can either be really good pot that's not quite the good shit, i.e. good seeds grown outdoors or bad seeds grown in doors; this usually is priced half way between regs an goods; ; OR it can be pretty bad stuff that is simply free of stems and too many seeds and therefore some jerk-off calls it mids so he can justify selling it to you for more $5 or $10 more than it should be ; At least... this is what I hear from my friends who do that kind of thing
