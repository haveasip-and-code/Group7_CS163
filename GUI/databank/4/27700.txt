oasis
A whiny, bitch-ass band to come out of england. Mega [Beatles] biters, and all around arseholes. Thinking they were the biggest shit next to slice bread, and what a shock that they amounted to a heap of beans in mexico, nowhere near the talent that [radiohead] has and nowhere near the longevity.
