Ronnie Woo-Woo
A common sight in and around Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs. ; Ronnie is arguably the biggest Cubs fan ever, to the point of being legendary, and can be seen mingling with just about anyone and leading the crowds in chants of 'woo! cubs! woo!' ; He is easy to spot because of his custom Cubs uniform that says 'Woo-Woo' on the back.
