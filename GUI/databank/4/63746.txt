hollocks
adjective used by filthy bitter pre-pubescent little boys, ashamed and embarrased that they will never grow penises. It is commonly used to disguise a broad jealousy for real men who take responsibility for their own lives, instead of sponging off mummy and daddy until their microscopic dicks shrivel up.
