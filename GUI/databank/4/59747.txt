dallywood
1. Dallywood is the hollywood of Bangladesh. The capital city of Bangladesh is Dhaka and, so the 'D' represents dhaka and implies the movie town of Bangladesh. ; 2. It prodcues the crappiest movie anyone has ever seen. The actresses are all fat and 90 years old. Tries to copy Hollywood and Bollywood but messes up big time. Only poor low class people watch it now.
