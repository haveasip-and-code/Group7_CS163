In The Groove
A dancing game developed by Roxor (and later partnered with Andamiro) in which players try to step on panels according to a step pattern that appears on screen. ; While nearly identical in concept to Konami's [Dance Dance Revolution], so much so that Roxor has been sued for patent and copyright infringement, some conceptual differences can be observed: the use of mines (which reduce one's life if triggered) and hands (a third or fourth arrow needing to be hit by slapping the panel with your hands), a scoring system based on the percentage of points scored over points possible, denser step patterns (some songs have over 800 steps, whereas DDR's densest song has only around 600), and a heavy emphasis on arrow modifiers present in the game's mod-heavy marathon courses
