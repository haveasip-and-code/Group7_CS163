chemical brothers
two guys named tom and ed who essentially founded a variation of electronica known as '[big beat]' in the 90's. however, many beleive that the group cannot be classified into one specific genre, and their music is eclectic and shows influences from places outside of electronic music (such as rock and even hip-hop). ; their first few albums displayed huge amounts of creativity and originality (such as 'dig your own hole' and 'surrender') that obviously could not be sustained for very long. i beleive they have passed their prime; and they know it, so they are currently collaborating with other artists, and the music they do now sounds almost nothing like their past.
