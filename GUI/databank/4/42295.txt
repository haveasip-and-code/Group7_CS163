Mel Gibson
a broken shell of a man that used to be a badass actor before he found jesus. his most recent and controversial film, the passion of the christ, is a very well done piece of art despite the fact it has nothing at all to do with christ's teachings. unfortunately, gibson seems to have lost his marbles. see his diane sawyer interview for proof. recently, gibson criticized the acadamy for awarding 'mediocre films.' apparently he is also a sore loser, being as the passion garnered not one oscar this year. gibson is best known for playing the title role in 'mad max' and its two sequels. despite what people say, mel is not a racist or a nazi, however, his father is an open anti-semite.
