rat bike
Urban sport bike ussually stripped down to bare essentials, painted flat black, and held together by zip ties and duct tape. Think Mad Max. Often the result of a nice new shinny bike being laid down by a [squid] and sold cheaply by the rider or insurance company. Common in the SF Bay area.
