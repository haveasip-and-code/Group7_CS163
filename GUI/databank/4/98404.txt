sfut
What you become when you are high on life and insane at 12:48 AM on June 21. ; Normal signs of sfutness include: ; - Breakage of headphones by sticking them up your nose and listening to the music come out of your mouth. ; - Sticking your tongue out at inanimate objects because they were giving you a 'funny look'. ; - Spinning around on a rolly chair, searching the road to Enlightenment. [In other words, you begin thinking you are Buddha.] ; - You take a pee while singing 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat.' ; - You laugh at the noise the fan is making because it reminds you of the squeeking of a bed during sex. ; - You end up making up words...such as sfut because you can't remember how to spell slut.
