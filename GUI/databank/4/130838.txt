pwick
originally spelled and pronounced P-WACK, now a scratchy sound from the throat. used to describe a screw up whether caused by bad luck, cosmic forces, or just a dumbass. usually combined with a hand motion with the thumb and pinky extended like the hang ten sign and then extending the arm at the target while turning the hand, much like churning butter. at times can be combined with [splurge].
