sheep shifter
A sneaky individual, probably Welsh in origin, who feels uncomfortable in the presence of sheep. Because they are a [sheep shagger] and they don't want people to notice their erection poking through their trousers. May also cry uncontrolably when they see someone wearing a woolen garment.
