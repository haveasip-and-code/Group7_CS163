code brown
medical terminology: Xray examination of the large intestine (i.e. for polyps) may require the dreaded double threat 'double contrast' barium/ air enema, in which the cleansed colon is rinsed with barium and then inflated with air like a balloon - if the patient is unable to maintain compression of the sphincter to retain the catheter/ split valve/ inflatable buttplug used to supply the barium/ air AND to stopper the anus, and thus sprays a mixture of air, barium and fecal matter under pressure from their anus (under pressure - remember the intestine is inflated with air), it may be known as a 'code brown'. this is one of many reasons Xray techs wear shoe covers.
