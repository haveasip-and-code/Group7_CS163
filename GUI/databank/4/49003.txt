Chavasion
This is a word that I invented to describe the way that a '[Chav]' would dress. I done this so we can say that someone dresses like a '[Chav]', without saying they act like a complete Twat like Chavs do. ; This would involve the tracksuits, sports gear almost every day, and for the females - big hoop ear-rings, having overly tanned skin (Usually orange), and for both males and females, although mostly females - and excessive amount of rings.
