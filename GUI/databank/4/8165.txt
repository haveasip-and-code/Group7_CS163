The Best Fan Page in the Universe
This is the original name of the site which is now called 'The Best Fan Site in the Universe'. A fansite for Maddox, owner and writer of 'The Best Damn Page in the Universe'. This site is viewed negatively by many members of Maddox Mania, who simply bash the site to try to look 'cool' and 'in the 'in crowd''. In reality, this site, run by admins Zoghade, Jesus Christ, and Himeros, has a lot more going for it than many people claim. Though this site is lower in the number of members, this board is almost always devoid of pointless spam and idiocy (the rare cases of pointless spam and idiocy usually come from an outsider who believes they are funny for being stupid).
