filipino
Okay. First off.... [filipinos] are asians! For those who dont consider flips as asians, then you're pretty stupid. because the philippines did come from asia! & just because its an island, doesnt mean its not from asia. look, japan is an island, & its considered as a part of asia?! sheesh.. okay well filipino's have dark skin.. but yeah most actually have light coloured skin. Most [flips] are found wearing BALLER clothing. Some are honger, nammer, & white washed. filipino's speak tribal languages such as tagalog, bisaya, ilocano, etc. you can get pretty mixed up between a flip, malaysian, cambodian, and laos. coz they all dark skinned. filipino's often work at fast food restaurants. Most flip parents are really strict and they push their kids to finish school and hope for them to get a great job, such as nursing, doctor, etc. they often strive to be the greatest in english. so most forget about their native language (which is not very good!) well yeah, thats all i can think of.. ; FLIP = Fine Little Islander Person. ; yeeeeeuh we cool
