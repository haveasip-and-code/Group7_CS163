crush slut
A person that has a crush on someone, assumes it is true love, and must automatically date their crush. The relationships between a crush slut and a normal person are relatively short, and even shorter if there are two crush sluts. After breaking up, the crush slut will find someone new within the first week. The cycle never ends until they die, apparently.
