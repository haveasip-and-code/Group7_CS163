snoob
Used mostly in Zimbabwe, the word snoob was created to counter the rising native knowledge of the derogatory names which they were being called. Thus, after they caught on to Kaffir, the word snoob was created. A snoob is any person of negro coloration, male or female, and regardless of whether they work in your garden.
