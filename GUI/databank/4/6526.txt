Quebecois French
Just another pathetic attempt by Quebecois to make Quebec different from the rest of the French speaking world. Quebec also likes to change spelling to suit them too. Martinique and Ivory Coast speak proper official French contrary to what Quebecoiss may think. It is Quebec that likes to change their vocab to suit them and seperate themselves further from French culture.
