deity links
Religious slang, usually used by Agnostics or Buddhists. 'Deity links' is usually used when somebody of another religion or a subsection of one's religion acts rude to another person of a different religious affiliation. 'Deity links' implies that our religions and the deities we worship are all one entity, linked together by empathy and love preached by all true religions. If somebody gets in your face about religion, simply say 'deity links, brother.'
