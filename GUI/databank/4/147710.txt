Baby Seal Argument
n. an argument in which you are arguing for the heck of it and may actually be against what you are arguing for. It originated in England when a girl named Anna became heavily involved with her friend Helen in an argument about whether it was ok to kill baby seals by smashing their skulls with hammers in Alaska because they had been eating the fish of the village.
