glen arm
Ah,Glen Arm. The land of tractors, farmers and a whole lot of nothing. If you're looking for a good time, keep searching because the most you will find out here along glen arm road is flat land with an occasional house thrown into the mix. Just a short ride to places like jacksonville, pheonix, and baldwin...not that these places contain much more excitement than glen arm itself. But then again, what would we do without our red-neck tractor driving farmers to give us a wave as we drive by?
