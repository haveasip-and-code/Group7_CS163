bitchecker
A guy who thinks he's a hacker just because he claims to have a program which can delete other people's hard drive if you know their IP, but doesn't know basic computer knowledge (how to say [DSL]; what's his own [IP]; difference between a kick and a ping timeout...) and ends up just making a fool of himself. ; Based on someone who went to the channel #stop[HipHop], threatened to use his program on someone else, but ended up using the program on himself and deleting his hard-drive. Currently missing. The log of the event can be easily found on the Internet.
