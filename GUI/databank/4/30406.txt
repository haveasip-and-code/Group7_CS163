Jesus  The
A sexual position in which the male stands behind the female, firmly holds her wrists, penetrates her from behind, and lifts her up, using the motion of his hips to pull out and push in. Two women can use a strap-on dildo to accomplish this. ; Extreme caution should be exercised to avoid unwanted anal penetration. ; Both heterosexual and homosexual couples can use this for anal sex if they have adequately prepared for the experience and applied sufficient lubrication. ; This position has little use other than for novelty or comedy value and should not be sprung upon your partner without advance warning.
