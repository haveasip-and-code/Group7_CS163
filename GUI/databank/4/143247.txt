how do you do?
Somewhat archaic greeting. Was popular in England in polite society before the 50s. ; The phrase is somthing of a non-sequiter - if read as written there's only half a verb, because one usualy does somthing rather than just does. The question could be construed as 'doing' your girlfriend or wife, but the intent is not to open a discussion on sexual acts, but rather to greet.
