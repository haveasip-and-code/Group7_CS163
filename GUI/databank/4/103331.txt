metal gear solid 4
Metal Gear Solid 4 is the game starring the world's most experienced stealth operator, Solid Snake. In the 6th game of this unbelievable sneaking saga (counting the games on Nes too) we'll be playing as Snake once more, now looking exactly like the Big Boss from Metal Gear I & II, from which he is a clone. ; In this era, after a not-yet-defined amount of years after MGS2 (as MGS3 was a prequel), the Metal Gears have been mass-produced and are used to invade the whole world. In all previous games, our hero was always able to stop an infamous group, called the Philosophers, from creating more then one Metal Gear, and always succeeded. But it seems this time it all happened too fast. Metal Gears are walking everywhere and Solid Snake is exhausted from battle, and his cloned genes are aging a minute per second. ; What must happen, how will it be and most important... Who shall follow the footsteps of the most respected character of Playsation II in the history of gaming? We shall see, at the dawn of PS3.
