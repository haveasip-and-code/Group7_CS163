ire it
A term that is used to mean smoking marijuana, or marijuana itself. It is only known by the people who do it, giving it somewhat of a codeword mentality. It stems from [ire] which is to be high or be in that state of mind. Generally used as a verb, but also used commonly as a noun in the place of [weed]. Pronounced eye-er it.
