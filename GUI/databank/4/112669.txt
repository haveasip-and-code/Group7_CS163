windows 2000
Probably the only fast and stable OS [Microsoft] has ever made. Windows 2000 (aka: Win2k) is based on the NT 5.0 kernel and is the predecessor to [Windows XP], it's obese cousin. ; Win2k will run almost all software made for WinXP, but since M$ wants your money, they have begun to intentionally cripple software to only work under WinXP, eg; Windows Media Player 10.
