Chronic Myspace User
Somebody who goes on their computer and the first thing they do is check their myspace to see if anything is new ; They do this about oh I don't know maybe 30 times a day ; This is also known as CMU. A chronic Myspace User when first tries myspace feels great but now A chronic just sits all day waiting for a reply on Myspace.
