draconic
The state of being overweight, unemployed and deluded. Draconic is a term applied to [otherkin] or [dragon kin], who blame all their problems on being 'in the wrong body', rather than their own laziness and inability to do something. Apparently facing reality and helping themselves is out of the question, especially when 'a draconic soul burns brightly inside'. ; A Draconic person believes they have the spirit of a dragon, though some take it a step further and claim their physical bodies are partially that of a dragon. Sometimes draconic people claim to have the mental capacity of a dragon- since they're both non-existent, this much is true.
