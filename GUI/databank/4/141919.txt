South Brunswick
Town in Central New Jersey that breeds 20-somethings who can't wait to move away and can't even think of raising their kids here. The only people that flock here for some ungodly reason are Indians (from India... not from the reservations). They take over the schools and cause actual SB kids to go to college and wonder where have all the Indians gone? ; South Brunswick is made up of little towns called Dayton, Monmouth Junction, Little Rocky Hill, Kendall Park, and Kingston. Each of these bring no more to the table than the next. ; Princeton is just a place you go to in high school and never to college. ; Close to Rutgers - everyone says they won't go there but statistically, 25% of the graduating classes of 500 will end up at RU New Brunswick.
