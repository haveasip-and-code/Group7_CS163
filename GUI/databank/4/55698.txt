arbetron
A robot formed from a real girl, known as amber. A terrible accident occurred during a stretcher race, in which she fell and hurt her shoulder. Soon after, her body failed and only her brain could be saved. She was then formed into a cardboard robot, Arbetron, and now works on the police force.
