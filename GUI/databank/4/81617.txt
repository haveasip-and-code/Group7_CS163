fundamentalist
A person, or usually group of assholes who think the term 'freedom of speech' means 'oppress everyone with your views'. Being that, in 99.9% of all cases in which fundamentalists are involved, religion or otherwise, there is not a single shred of solid evidence to support their claim, they usually attempt to use catch-phrases like 'pro-life' and are often cited as 'politically correct'. George Bush is living proof that fundamentalists have corrupted an already religiously oppressive nation by enforcing their opinions over others, without the benifit of popular vote or atleast a response of 'Hey, if you don't like it, don't do it, and leave me the fuck alone.' Most non-fundamentalists don't give a shit if their dollar bills say 'In God we trust', as long as they can buy what they need to and live their own fucking lives, without constantly interfering with others'.
