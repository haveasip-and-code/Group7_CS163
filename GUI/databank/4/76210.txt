Sauron
Possibly one of the greatest villains ever. He is also one of the most original (The LOTR has been around before star wars). He's pretty awesome when he sends a bunch of guys flying through the air. Nice armoured suit too. It's a shame you don't see him very often. No one really knows what his face looks like either.
