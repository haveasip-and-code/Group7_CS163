thongs
Simple, cheap, rubber sandals held on the feet with a two-piece strap, which is anchored to the top of the sole on the inside foot arch, between the big and second toes and on the outside near the heel. Thongs were invented in New Zealand in the late 50s, but, like any other Kiwi invention, they were quickly claimed by Australians as their own (see also Russell Crowe and Crowded House).
