junior high
a place where kids CANNOT keep a boyfriend or girlfriend for more than two weeks. a place meant for learning but is mostly used for social and other purposes. usually for kids in 7th and 8th grade often ages range from 13-15, but there are a lot of people out there that are 35 and are still in jr. high. and still havent had a mate for over two weeks
