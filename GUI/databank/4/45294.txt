vanilla ice
A brutal and insane man wearing no pants whatsoever (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, called Iced in the US game for). He holds his lord in high regard, and if you make him attack a figure that looks exactly like his lord, he will go kung-fooey on your ass and beat it until you are fubar but still living, and there's no stopping him when he's like this. He's THAT brutal, insane, and unstoppable. ; Also, you could call any pantless (religious) zealot a Vanilla Ice.
