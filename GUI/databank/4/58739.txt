Bathtub Mary
A clawfoot bathtub painted skyblue inside and planted half-way down in the yard of low-life Catholics who place a Mary statue inside. Faded plastic flowers usually adorn the bare dirt at the base of Mary's feet. More than likely what would be the bottom of the tub hasn't been painted and is either rusty or whatever paint that was on it is peeling off.
