Look at the Rabbits
Reference to 'Of Mice and Men', namely the ending where George tells Lennie to look at the rabbits so he can shoot Lennie while he's not looking. Basically means the same thing as [go play in traffic]; go jump off a cliff, die, etc. in addition to calling the person a retard. Could also be interpreted as a threat.
