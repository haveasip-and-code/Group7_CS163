Kemper McTwister
-the kemper mctwister or (KMT) is actually a very serious problem that deals with being rapidly airborne. often during a very windy baseball game a [kemp] is likely to be hurled into the air by a dust tornado(twister). this is actually a very serious and scary moment for a dwarfy person. during the expirence one is often spotted scrambling for a McDonalds 'McGriddles' biscuit so that he can stick his dong in the middle and beat off with the warm sensation rubbing on his pecker. thats why its called a Kemper McTwister
