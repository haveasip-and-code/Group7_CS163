Final Fantasy 6
A pretty crappy game that a lot of wannabe game gurus refer to when they want to feel superior to people that like any newer FF games (FF7, 8, 9, X, etc). Look for mentions of this game during a conversation about newer games. Also look for key words such as 'overrated' and 'all graphics and no story' when comparing FF6 to these newer games.
