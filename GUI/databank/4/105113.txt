quebbs
A card game with a devoted cult following. The object of the game is to accumulate 4 of a kind, then to get one's partner to say 'Quebbs!' through the use of a spoken code. Saying 'quebbs' results in one point and the end of the hand. If a player suspects another player (who is not his partner) of having 4 of a kind, he may call '[shmook]!' also gaining a point and ending the round. Double Quebbs and Double Shmook are also possible, as well as any combination thereof, provided both partners call them at the same time.
