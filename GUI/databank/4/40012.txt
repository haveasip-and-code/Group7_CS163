ugatz
Ugatz is derived from the Italian 'u casso', literally translated as 'this penis'. The accompanying gesture involves dramatically lowering both hands, palms flat and facing outward, toward one's crotch. The term is used to signify a challenge to another in a variety of scenarios (see example below).
