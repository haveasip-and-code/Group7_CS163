sk8
sk8 used to be how to distinguish skateboearding from inline skating , skateboardign was known as sk8ing, and inline skating was known as just 'skating' infortunatly the new wave of kids who were influenced by a crapass retardo show called [rocket power] started sayin sk8 because they thaught it was cool, now, its regarded, as a stupid word that only posers and fat kids use/ ; thanks alot you damn noobs for making me have to write out 'skateboarding' now
