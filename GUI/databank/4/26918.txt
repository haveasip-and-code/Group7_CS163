Zippy the Pinhead
To paraphrase Robert Crumb, perhaps the only daily comic in America worth taking a'gander at. Common fodder includes the lyrical nature of the English language, the upsetting predeliction towards mindless consumerism rampant throughout Modern America, and gargantuan roadside artifices. Blends postmodern, absurdist, and slyly leftist leanings in a potpourri of at once dry and eclectic humor. ; If you can't get it, that's your loss.
