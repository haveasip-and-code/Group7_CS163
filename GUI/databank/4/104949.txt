One of those unfortunate 'fringe' words that has entered into the language - not popular enough for you to know what it means and not obscure enough for you never to have come in contact with it. ; The type of word that thrives in the midst of ego inflating chain mail dreck destined to be circulated by the staff at universities everywhere. It will be sandwiched between two other equally esoteric words with equally redundant applications. ; Used by supposedly tech savvy English Lecturers who believe that their ability to use such terms is inextricably linked with their (immense) technological skill. ; These are the same Lecturers who spontaneously orgasm over the correct usage of a word like 'poleaxed' or wear Atari T-shirts to conventions just for the recognition.
