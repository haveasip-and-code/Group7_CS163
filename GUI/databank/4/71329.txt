Euronymous
Given name: Oystein Aarseth. Deceased guitar player of Norwegian black metal act [Mayhem]. Was and is still considered a standout character, or even a celebrity, within the black metal movement, mainly due to his outspoken nature in interviews and his efforts, both musical and otherwise, in the black metal genre. Besides participating in classic albums such as 'Deathcrush,' 'Live in Liepzig,' and 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' as the guitarist of [Mayhem], Aarseth also owned and operated a record store called Helvete, or 'Hell' in Norwegian, which stocked only the most extreme metal music. Killed by Varg Vikernes, also known as Count Grishnackh or The Count, on August 10th, 1993. To many fans of black metal, Mayhem ceased to truly exist after Euronymous' death despite the fact that the band was reformed afterwards, and hence, all Mayhem releases released up to 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' are commonly said to have been recorded by 'The True Mayhem' by fans.
