the city
The City refers to Manhattan OR the five boroughs. If you live in the boroughs, then 'The City' is definately Manhattan. Outside of the boroughs, it can mean the boroughs as a whole or just Manhattan. ; Remember: New York City isn't just Manhatten, it's the whole five boroughs (Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and Manhattan).
