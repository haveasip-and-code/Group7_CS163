Supercontinent
The one and only massive exterior body or continent on a planet. A long long time ago, Pangea was the Earth's only body of land, and it was really big. Thus it was called a supercontinent. The supercontinent broke apart due to shifting of Earth's crusts, so now today, we have many mini-pangeas called continents.
