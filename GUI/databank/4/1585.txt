A Female from Canada. ; She is not the one who ruined punk, that started a loooong time ago, maybe even as far back as the 80's. ; Even though many people hate her, quite a few girls(and even some boys) like her because she was the first 'Punk' band singer that 'mummy' and 'daddy' did not get freaked out about, meaning they still got money from their richass high class familys, but they still got respect from their friends because she was 'punk rock'. ; This pissed the people who had to give up a lot to listen to real rock, and had people stare at them funny. It also made some people angry because she CAN'T sing! ; Finally it made some people mad, because the weird tenny boppers think that all rock and roll, as well as punk people are their 'friends' and 'sisters' and 'brothers' in the fight against authority... ; She also pissed of the Anarchists because she stole the anarchy sign, and tried to make it her own. ; Personally the reason I hate her, is that ever since she did the song 'sk8er boi' we've been killed with that kind writing. 'OMG, Shz the shit, ain't aril gr8!' God that pisses me off... she also got the people who do this to come out of the closet. 'OmG iSN't sHE thE BESt!' *twitch* ; She also can't proform, and even if you are one of the few who likes her music, I warn you not to go to her concerts. She doesn't dance, move or anything like that... and they are very boring. I know, I got dragged to one of them by my little sister.... ; also see [poser], [bleach blond] [anti-rock], and [pop]
