Similar to a [guido], only this term refers to the Mexican faction of these people. They usually wear designer clothes , ugly Deisel shoes, Nextel Boost Mobile phones attached to the hip, and guys have spiked up hair with loads of gel. They use a lot of Spanish slang and are often loud and obnoxious. Party a lot and blast shitty techno from their cars. This term seems to be limited to San Diego, feel free to let me know otherwise.
