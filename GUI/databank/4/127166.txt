black pope
term used to define his next holy blackness. Term used also to express a well deserved change in the roman catholic church. Also some say the end of the world will come with a black pope. A straight foward change that will send millions of white catholics hurling back to reality from their oh so mighty cloud of naive. change is come son, with a whole lot of soul.
