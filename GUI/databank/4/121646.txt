emo boys
Emo boys are first off- unbelivably hot. ; but really they are just boys who are really in touch with their emotions. steriotypically they do not fit in because they cry, but that is just compleatly sweet and adorable. ; emo boys (or girls) should not be judged without first having personally gotten to know at least three emo people, if nobody judged them without getting to know them first, they would probably be the most loved people around.
