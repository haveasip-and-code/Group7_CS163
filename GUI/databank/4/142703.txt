pull a trent
To oversleep. Trent is the name of Jane Lane's brother and Daria's love interest on the popular TV show [Daria], formerly on MTV and then on The N. Trent is famed for getting up at about 4 in the afternoon, and is always late for band practice. He famously sleeps on his bed stomach-down, his face buried into the pillow, on top of the blankets, in only his boxers.
