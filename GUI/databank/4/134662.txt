hoodie party
The first massive gathering of college freshmen after about half a semester at college. Sometimes occurs on Columbus Day weekend, more often Thanksgiving weekend. Named because everyone attending is wearing a hoodie representing their respective college/university. ; Pastimes include embelishing college experiences, reminesing about high school days, and hooking up with old high school crushes.
