Avril Push
The term Avril Push was derived from Avril Lavigne music videos which, more or less, follow the same formula. Theres always a man that looks like hes from a shampoo/hair product commercial that is mean to Avril. At some point in the video, Avril pushes this man away from her (almost always in slow-motion) and then runs off to sing into the camera. ; This term has come to describe any scenario in which a distressed woman pushes a man away in an overly-dramatic fashion and then runs off.
