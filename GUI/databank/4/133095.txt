Totus Tuus
Latin expression prominently associated with the late Pope John Paul II, first coined in his 1994 book 'Crossing the Threshold of Hope.' Means, 'all for you', expressing the ideal of a worldly commitment to a single good. Pope John Paul II would write this expression in the top right-hand corner of every hand-written document.
