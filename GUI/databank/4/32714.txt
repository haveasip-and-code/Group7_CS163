Kaishaku
A 'second' in ancient Japanese culture. This person would act on behalf of the Shogunate. This would be an executioner who decapitates men after they have performed ritualistic suicide ([Seppuko]). ; An example of this is the character Ogami Itto in the film series 'Lone Wolf and Cub'. He was chief executioner and would behead disgraced samurai with [one fell swoop] of his [dotanuki].
