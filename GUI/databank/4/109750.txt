Fight Club
A movie/book that is over-used and often misunderstood. This book shows how most of the world is obsessed with consumer products. The movie is not about beating each other senseless for fun, and it is not about the rules and those who are out there writing definitions reciting the rules are just douchebags. The movie is not REAL. It is a MOVIE. Tone down your imaginations and get over it. However, the point the movie makes is a valid and mostly overlooked point that everyone should consider.
