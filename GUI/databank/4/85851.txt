Bowb
A universally useful insult word from Harry Harrison's 'Bill the Galactic Hero' books. The original work was a parody of Starship Troopers and contemporary sci-fi novels. As such, it mocked futurism by including a new slang word: bowb. ; Depending on usage, bowb can be a noun, proper noun, verb, or adjective. Also see: 'Fuck.'
