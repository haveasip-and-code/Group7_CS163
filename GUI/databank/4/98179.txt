dr pepper
A drink that was actually created by a man who was trying to make another Cola, and accidently spilled cough syrup in it. He tasted it, and thought it was pretty good. The drink is not made with cough syrup today, but thats where it got it's strange flavor from. Don't believe me.... Look it up.
