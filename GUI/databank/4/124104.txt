Dante's The Inferno
Quite possibly one of the most influential books in an entire era. Dante Aligheri is the author of The Inferno which is an epic story of how Dante crosses the nine circles of hell. The poetic form is what is currently known as a tursa rema. Dante himself was the first writer who entered Europe into the Renaissance because of his reforms in writing and his general genius and influence over an entire continent.
