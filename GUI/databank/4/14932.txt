Valley Caliche
Hands down the most dominating soccer team of the late 1990's. After taking everyone's pride and winning state in the red division they got moved up to a better, tougher division. The domination didn't slow down a bit and Valley Caliche is still considered the bomb and way better than the Little Pickle's which were the best in the early 1990's.
