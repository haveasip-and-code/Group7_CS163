sushi
A japanese cuisine that most americans crowd over because they are obsessed with anything japanese. As for me, I just like it because its great and healthy. ; For all you ignorant dumb fuck right winger bastards who are all 'EWW! Raw fish!'NO, it is not always raw fish. some sushi has no meat in it at all. have you ever even had it? You should really just try it. instead of running away from it.
