tidus
Main character in Final Fantasy X. Very annoying and feminine. Falls in love with Yuna. Dies at the end, because, guess what? He was just a dream. The happiest I've ever felt at the end of a video game, because he finally shut up...forever, unless you go out and buy [ffx-2]. Still one hell of a good game. Just with mute on. (And yes, it is really prenounced Tee-dus; said by Square, and in Kingdom Hearts)
