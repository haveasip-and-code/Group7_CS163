Re
Originally short for 'retard,' but this term is not seen as politically correct. Re generally holds a positive connotation, and should be seen almost always as a compliment. The standard-plus-minus scale can also be applied to this helpful term. (RE+ being a good re, RE being a plain old re, and RE- being a re in the negative sense.
