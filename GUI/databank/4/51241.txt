Juneau
Juneau is the current capitol of Alaska, where it is rumored that teams of dogs lead men to mines of gold and bears out number humans 2/1. When disscusing Juenau the small white logging town of Sitka, may arise in conversation. It is best in these situations to ignore the subject of Sitka, as it's residents are still some what sore that it is not the capitol.
