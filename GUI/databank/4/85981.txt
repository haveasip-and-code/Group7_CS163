anti-corporate
People that have a dislike or hatred towards large organizations such as corporations, large government, etc. Very often these people have little understanding of business and assume that simply because a corporation is big that they are evil or the administrators are corrupt and immoral because obviously the pursuit of prosperity and success through hard work and good decision making blackens one's soul. These people are often involved in a subculture group (i.e. [punk], [hippie], [hacker]/ ; culture jammer) which encourages their participants to all have the same opinions.
