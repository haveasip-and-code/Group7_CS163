Remington Model 700
A bolt action [rifle], available in many calibers, it is said to be the most accurate 'out of the box' of any manufacturer. It is used primarily as a hunting firearm. The US Military also uses it as the basis for their M24 [Sniper]'s Weapon System (SWS) in [7.62x51mm NATO] caliber.
