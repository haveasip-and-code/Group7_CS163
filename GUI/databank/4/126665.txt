Contours
Contours refers to when you climb out of a swimming pool and your shorts cling to your crotch area giving a very accurate 3 dimensional impression of what your meat and 2 veg look like. Particularly embarrassing in large pools with lots of people. Can be avoided, but takes practise. Contours cannot be achieved in speedos for obvious reasons.
