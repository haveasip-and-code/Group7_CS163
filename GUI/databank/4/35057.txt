masculine
Often defined as [aggressive], strong, and unfeeling or [stoic]. Being masculine means in modern times, at least, no shows of [emotion], no [flamboyance], no hugging or even looking at other men, must be interested in sports and physical/[violent] activity. ; What masculine is is simply what a man does. Assuming responsibility for your actions; being [sympathetic], [sensitive], and [caring]; and gentleness are perfectly fine for men. A true man is not a hard-nosed, violent, overgrown child; he's a mature, kind individual.
