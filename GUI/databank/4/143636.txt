Pasties
Drugs. A way of being able to admit to a friend that you are on drugs, without it being so obvious that every [bobby] this side of Tibet arrests you in three minutes. A pasty is someone on drugs, and so therefore a Cornish Pasty is a drugged up person from the Cornwall area of Great Britain.
