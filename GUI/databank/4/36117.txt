Villa Walsh Academy (VWA)
It's not 4 years... It's 4 life. ; An all-girls Catholic school located in Morristown, NJ which features old and decaying nuns monitoring the halls. It is a place where ankles are scandalous and too many untucked shirts are grounds for expulsion. It is a place where they love to sing, and will use almost any excuse to burst into harmonic hymns. The lowest GPA for a class of 50 will be a 3.2, and the senior class will spontaneously erupt into fistfights to see who gets to attend BC, Notre Dame, and Georgetown. Losers will go to Loyola, Villanova, or Fairfield. Lunch costs $8, and consists of 8 oz. of 'gourmet' mac and cheese. Breadsticks, due to increasing thefts, are an extra $2. This school also features a 'penthouse suite' - previously nuns' chambers, these prestigiously located rooms are the current homes for the two most legendary and enlightened teachers at the school and their playful seeing-eye pooch, Pam (shout out to Reba). The grounds are extensive and beautiful, whether viewed from the bridge full of cacti or from wandering around outside. The school features a gazebo where you can sit but not eat, a funeral pyre placed before the tower (enacting pretend human sacrifices on this is frowned upon), and a statue of Mary that looks suspisciously like Jesus. Students who act up are punished by being made to run from the man-statue of Mary up the hill to the funeral pyre. ; Often associated with Delbarton, other than sharing a bus to and from school, there is little association. Probably because everyone's too tired from having to walk up and down petruvious amounts of stairs all day long. Huge amounts of oddly shaped and spaced stairs. ; A word to the wise: Don't kick a bible down the locker room. They don't like that either, and you will be smote.
