Homies_Say_Ho
Someone who can not stop themself from incessant bitching because they have nothing better to do after they get owned. They believe that dying in an online video game such as CS is the worst thing that can happen. After dying, bullshit excuses and accusations of hacking have to be thrown about. If this persons self assumed 'leetness' gets dented in any way, and you caused this blow to his elevated ego, you may be labelled a hacker.
