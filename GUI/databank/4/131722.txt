Phenomenology
Philosophical method/discipline, typically associated with 20th century Psychology (Husserl) and Existential Philosophy (Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty). ; One of the aims of Phenomenology is to attempt to describe something (an object, an experience) directly, seperately from its preconceived origins or causal explanations. ; Most of our experiences are clouded by preconceptions. By identifying these preconceptions, it was thought that Phenomenology could help us distinguish between what is real and what is appearance.
