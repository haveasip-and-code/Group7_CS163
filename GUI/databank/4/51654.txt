flogger
A guitarist disliked by middle-aged hair-metal enthusiasts and bedroom prog-rockers, because he/she does not employ--and may publicly disdain--flashy guitar solos. The term is applied regardless of compositional talent or actual technical proficiency. Use is generally restricted to Internet guitar discussion boards and occasional letters to the editor of magazines such as Guitar World.
