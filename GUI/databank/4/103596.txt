The Tempest
A major ass stomping storm thats said to be due in the year 2006, prophesied by the [Insane Clown Posse] in their 2005 album [The Calm]. Apparently this storm is supposed to rip all the non-believers a new asshole with lightning that sets fire to water, flaming tornadoes, thunder loud enough to shatter brick walls, and all other manner of apocalyptic phenomenon.
