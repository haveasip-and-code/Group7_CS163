rushmore
The [movie] from the 90's of course. Basically, it's about a fifteen year old named [Max Fischer] who is totally obsessed with the private school, [Rushmore]. But since he's not very smart (yet extremely talented at writing plays, go figure), he's expelled. However, he falls in love with another teacher, who becomes his obsession. And ANOTHER however, the teacher he falls in love with is romantically linked to his MENTOR. Hence many conflicts and such. ; Also, several lines from this movie give song titles / references to bands like [Brand New], the old [Fall Out Boy], and [Every Time I Die]. Hence where the song title, 'Tell That Mick He Just Made My List Of Things To Do Today.' A line in the movie. ; ALSO used to say that you love some one more than life itself.
