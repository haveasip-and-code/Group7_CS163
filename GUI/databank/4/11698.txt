flamer
a man who puts on a button-down, pink shirt with three buttons undone, torn jeans from abercrombie, flip flops, silk underwear and mousse in his hair and then heads out and cries to a barbra streisand musical, after which he goes to starbucks, where he orders a cappuccino, which he enjoys while reading an article in 'vogue' about how to please your man. after all this, the 'man' goes to the gap for some shopping and then heads out for a manicure and hair appointment.
