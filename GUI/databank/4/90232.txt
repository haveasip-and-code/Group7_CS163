weeb
A somewhat funny mispronunciation of the word 'web' (i.e. Internet). Taken from an old RadioShack commercial where a sleazy PC salesman was trying to sell an old POS Tandy to a total noobtard. ; A parody of the company's slogan soon popped up on the net afterwards: ; 'RadioShack: You've got money, We've got pockets' ; See [internut]
