Tiger Schulmann's Karate
A waste of money. These people don't know shit. They are just interested in your money. They don't even know what style of karate they do. They were sued by the Attorney General for deceiving costumers. They coudn't fight their way out of a paper bag. ; They will always be a skidmark on the underpants of society!
