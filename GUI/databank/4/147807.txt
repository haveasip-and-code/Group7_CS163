pompooey
A word hard to define in anything other than example. Like being dragged backwards into a sweaty mules arsehole. Like realising your drunken, filthy party lay was your grandparent. Or walking in on your dad smeared in Vaseline, wearing nothing but Y fronts, gyrating with an inflatable doll to Bonnie Tyler... a gentler way of expressing these things.
