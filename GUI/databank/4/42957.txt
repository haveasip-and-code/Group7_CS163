non-conformist
A person who goes on about how s/he is incredibly against stereo-types (generally by shopping at Hot Topic, fancy that) and prefers to hang in the company of other 'non-conformists,' while they live in the facade that they're a special and different from everyone else. However, in reality, when you look upon a crowd of self-proclaimed non-comformists, you really don't notice any signifigance between them. So, in simple terms, all the non-comformists looking to look different, all look the same.
