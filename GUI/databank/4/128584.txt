Lillith
In the Vampicic culture, Lillith was Adams First wife and the Mother of Cain. She was kicked out of the Garden of Eden for some unknown reason and in order to survive made a pact with Lucifer. Cain eventually met Lillith in the land of Nod(where he was banashed to), and drank of Lillith to survive. Thus becoming the matron and patron of all vampires.
