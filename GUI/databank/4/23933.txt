Hank Hill
A popular cartoon T.V. dad on the FX show King of the Hill. He lives with his family Peggy (wife), Bobby (son), Ladybird (dog), and Luanne (niece) in the fictional Texas city of Arlen. He is a true, hard-working, tell-it-like-it-is American dad. His best friends are Dale Gribble, Bill, and Boomhower. Hank is more conservative and right-leaning, and, as a result, has greater family values and stronger morals than others. His friends tend to do stupid or mean things that often piss him off.
