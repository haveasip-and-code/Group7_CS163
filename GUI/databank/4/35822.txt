seaford  VA
This is the most redneck town in VA. ; All boys talk about on the bus is what wheels they put on their 4 wheelers and the girls either don't have any fashion sense at all and just wear stinky t shirts and jeans or they're wiggers or they don't bathe and always smell really bad. ; Being a prep at heart and not being able to go all the way with in this town is very heartbreaking. For example if I wore a pair of capris with whales embroidered on them, every kid in my school would make fun of me. ; It is so sad. ; These people are also very mean. ; They can't try to be sophisticated at all. Again, I cry to myself. I swear, I am living in the wrong place. I should be living in [williamsburg, VA], which is the best town in the country, not to mention the world!! ; But yes seaford is a place where people always talk about going to the huge Baptist church, even when they're not Baptist, just so they can hear the latest gossip. ; It is also a place where there are the popular cheerleaders and losers, goths, exc., but it is not sophisticated enough to have real preps (which is so sad!) ; It is also a place where people hang out at the Seaford Country Market, which is owned by a fat, arrogant man who has a fat arrogant son who rides my bus and always pushes me out of his way when I'm in his flipping (excuse my french) way!
