Lovewell
Once considered the most honorable class of love-makers in all the land, members regarded for both instinctive and learned traits. Only existing Lovewell's today are the few that still carry the name. All Lovewell's being naturally incredible due to impeccable genetics, are characteristically desired as husbands and wives, never to each other of couse, that's disgusting. One must be careful however to capitalize correctly, as addressing one as a [lovewell] is exclusively insulting. (Verbal address assumes capitalization of L unless otherwise noted.)
