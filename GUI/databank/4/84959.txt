shampoo effect
A residual drug or alcohol phenomonon in which, during a period after a heavy binge, only a small amount of the recently-abused substance is needed to re-activate your buzz. So named after what happens in the shower when you 'rinse and repeat': only a tiny bit of shampoo is needed the second time around to achieve a full sudsy lather.
