hagache
The kind of headache you get from listening to some annoying [hag] go on and on about something you could care less about. Sadly, this type of headache takes a hell of a lot more than 2 Motrins to get rid of, which is why most people who are married to a [hag], end up being alcoholics. See [alcoholic].
