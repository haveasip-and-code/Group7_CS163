Darien
It's a town that always gets labled as the rich town with stuck up preppy kids who drink way to much and who will get no where in life unless of course they get through everything with their parents money. But lots of people are not like that and have to try just as hard and put just the same amount of work as other kids do in other towns. Not everyone is like the lable people give Darien there are lots of problems, troubles, and pain going on everywhere in here that no one gets to see just as there is in other towns and there are great friendly nice people with real intelligence that you probably haven't gotten to notice or bother with. But I just wanted to clear it up Darien is just like other towns and is NOT what its lable says it is!! -Thank you
