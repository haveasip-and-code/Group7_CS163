to show off a cars power by accelerating from either a stop or a slow crawl in order to raise the front end as high as possible then eccessive braking is applied in order to brin g the front back down 'dip'. this action is repeated untill the viehecle operater chooses to stop,crashesor stoped by a law inforcing officer. ; in a car with manual transmission however, the driver would only hav to leave the viehcle in its first gear, then full throttle for a short moment then lettin go and allowing engine break to achieve the ' Dip ' motion
