Sisto
The younger brother of former space pirate, [Brak]. Long ago he was Brak's second in command, helping him commit evil insidious acts, but radiation from a meteor shower had riddled them harmless. While [Brak] became retarded, Sisto became mute (though he tends to respond with to people with [fart] noises). ; Though it is still uncertain what species [Brak] and Sisto actually are, their kind have been refered to as catmen on numerous occasions. Though the two are almost identical, Sisto is much shorter and wears a red uniform in contrast to [Brak]'s blue uniform. Supposively, he was killed off in ep 18 when aliens beamed him up as their chosen food source.
