soulless point monger
One who asks really stupid questions in AP Chemistry and gets on my nerves. AHHHHHHHH. Disgusting people. They sit there and discuss the functions of TI-89s and -83s and when the teach gives them a dumb look and a sarcastic answer they take him seriously, thinking he is trying to explain somethign to them. They think they deserve to go to Stanford or Harvard or Princeton when they really don't deserve to get into American Intercontinental online college. They don't understand that school is about learning and not about getting points. I mean who the hell gives out points in the real world. Honestly, when these people get a job and there boss says good job, they will look back with a dumbass grin and ask, 'Would I have deserved an A.' These people sicken me.
