Seth MacFarlane
Seth MacFarlane is the creator of Fox's 'American Dad!' and the often cancelled 'Family Guy,' cancelled three times since its television premiere in 1999. ; Few people notice and dislike the fact that he is the voice of practically every male character on his show 'Family Guy.' This is the reason some has stopped watching -- namely me.
