Dana Hall
A preppy allgirls school in Wellesley Massachusetts where 4 out of 5 girls are wearing uggs and/or northface jackets every day. Most of the girls are rich and they don't hide it. The day students are usually the rich ones who dress nice (i donno who they want to impress but they claim to be straight). The boarders are more laid back and don't care as much about money and material shit. Alot of the girls are fake and have fake frienships. The classes are hard and it's a very stressful school. At the same time, students get in trouble alot. Poor kids can get kicked out for anything bad. But if you have money you're usually safe. That's how life works though. Dana Hall is a reality check for the boarders and poor kids. But the rest will have to face reality later in life. Dana Hall is the worst and the best times of your life.
