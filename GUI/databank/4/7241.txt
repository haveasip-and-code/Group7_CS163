Nirvana
Nirvana was a band that the Seattle grunge scene produced in the early-1990s. Although they were often thought of as popular awesome gods, they are really just a terrible band led by the blubbering and incomprehensible (and now deceased) [Kurt Cobain], who blew his [brains] out in [1994]. The Nirvana drummer, [Dave Grohl], now has a successful project with [the Foo Fighters] and also [Probot].
