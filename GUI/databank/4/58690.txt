bayad
What Scradam is for thinking he can get away with messing with the definitions for wonderfuls and luckies. He got it backwards, and that is BAYAD. Bayad is more or less a strongly distorted and slightly retarded pronunciation of the word 'bad'. Unlike the word 'bad', bayad ALWAYS refers to something not good. ; Antonym: Grood
