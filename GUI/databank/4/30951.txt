cox high school
Cox high school is a place where, if you're a girl, it's all about what size pants you wear (preferrably size 0 if you want to be cool), what size boobs you have (preferrably a full C or D if you want any guys), and how many older guys you've dated. For guys, on the other hand, it's all about what kind of skate shoes you have, how low you wear you pants, and how many girls' virginity you have taken. Cox is quite possibly the most superficial place on the planet. Everyone walks around with their noses in the air, ESPECIALLY if we're at another school for an away football game for example. Cox will come there invading the hell out of that turf (even though our football team sucks). We still think we run shop wherever we go. There are maybe 2 ugly cars in the parking lot, IF THAT. Everyone drives a nice vehicle, and you see all of these same cars at 81st street everyday at 12:20 when the seniors get out. To sum it all up, Cox is full of rich, snobby, white, blonde-headed little beach kids who think they're on the O.C. But it's damn fun and it taught my ass how to party.
