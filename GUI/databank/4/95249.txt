Castilian (The Castilian Language)
Castilian is the official language of Spain and all the countries that have been colonized by Spain. The term 'Spanish' is totally incorrect. WRONG! The language we speak is called Castilian (Castellano). It is the same language spoken in Spain (just different accent). You musn't forget that Spain relies on 4 languages (Spanish languages) which are Castilian (Official one) Galician, Catalan, and Euskera.
