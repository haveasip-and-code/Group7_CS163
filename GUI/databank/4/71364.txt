quoff
Alternate spelling of [quofe] (also [quoaf] or [quof]). ; noun: Penile flatulence (air or gas escaping from the penis through the urethra), a.k.a. a [dick fart]. ; verb: To emit penile flatulence. ; ETYMOLOGY: 'Quofe' is the male form of [queef]. ; NOTE: Quofes are a rare phenomenon compared to queefs because it is much harder for air to become stuck in a man's urethra than in a woman's comparatively larger vagina. Quofes occur most frequently after a [catheter] has been inserted into the penis and removed, leaving air trapped in the bladder or urethra.
