Hopkin Green Frog
An autistic boy's stuffed green frog by the name of 'Hopkins' (thats the name McDonalds gave it when they included stuffed toys with Kids Meal advertising Animal Alley) that supposedly run away. ; Rumor has it he just lost the frog. Anyway, soon after he was posting drawn signs that look like a kid drew it. An internet site , lostfrog.org, is a tribute to this autistic 16 year old's frog. Its kinda dumb though.
