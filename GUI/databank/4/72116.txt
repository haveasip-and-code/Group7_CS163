HCLB
HCLB stands for Hardcore Ladyboy. The definition of a HCLB's clothing is: ; o A VERY tight pair of jeans, think Olivia Newton-John In Grease ; o VERY big hair, usually spiked up with flat bits at the front, but can be anything big, usually black or blonde, or both. ; o A VERY tight top, a t-shirt or checked shirt for example. ; o A pack of 'Malboro''s stuffed in their teeny tiny back pocket. ; o Shoes are either Converse All Stars, Undergrounds or some other fairly thin lightweight shoes. ; The reason for the Ladyboy portion of their name is the clothing they wear is usually considered un-manly due to it's excessively tight nature. ; As an afterthought, i take NO credit for this term, 'Liv' coined it! ; I love HCLB's.
