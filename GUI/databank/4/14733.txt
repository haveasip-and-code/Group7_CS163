Diamond WEAPON
Appears in FF7 when you leave the City of the Ancients after using the Key. Despite its tough appearence, a beginner could easily beat this thing. All of its attacks are Magic and are relatively weak, but watch out for Diamond Flash. Have a character equipped with Ribbon and Cure-All. Then use Echo Screens to cure Silence. Invulnerable to most physical attacks until it prepares to do Diamond Flash.
