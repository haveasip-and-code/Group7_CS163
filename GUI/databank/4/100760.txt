Fagtron
(n.) A person who is so annoying and/or stupid as to resemble Fagtron, the mysterious and fabled computer built in 1918 by the Chinese. This primitive adding machine stood over fifty feet tall and filled an entire office building. It was well-known as the world's gayest and stupidest computer until its destruction in 1924, caused by an acute case of e-AIDS.
