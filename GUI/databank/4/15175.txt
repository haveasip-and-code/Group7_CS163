Trinity
Christians believe that God is a trinity, consisting of Jesus, the Father, and the Holy Spirit. Supposedly these 3 together are God. Yet since they are not together, there is technically no one all powerful God. If God was perfect, he would not require three parts to acomplish what He wanted. A perfect God would be one God, and he will never show himself on this Earth for he is above such things. The Jews were too scared to eaven 'HEAR' him because they feared they would die, and God said it was a good decision. Yet they claim Jesus is God or part of God, but while on earth he was 100% God and 100% man (adds up to 200% but Christians can't count). In reality, Jesus was just a man. The powers he had he said came from the Father. So in reality he was 100% man and 0% God. Yet most Christians will never agree to this, because the idea that God not being God even for a while is ridiculous. Yet it is the truth what they believe. Why else could Jesus ask the Father for help, say he did everying because of the Father's help. ; On a side note, Jews do not believe Jesus was a prophet or God, but just a good man, even though they killed him. Muslims believe Jesus was just a prophet, and not God. They reject the idea of the Trinity. In fact the Holy Spirit in Islam is not part of God but it is Gabriel. Truly the Islamic view makes the most sense.
