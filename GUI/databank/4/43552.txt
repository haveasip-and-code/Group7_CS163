The Darkness
A bunch of Queen wannabees (who I have got absolutely nothing against) with a bunch of annoying fans who dosen't know the definition of selling out and have the absolute nerve of comparing the band themselves with teenyboppers who were meant for children, forgetting that was the kind of music they would have listened to at their age. They also complain about the lack of quality of music now even they are 20 years old and had being listening to Take That, Backstreet Boys, East 17, Peter Andre 10 years before
