euro trash
A mildly derisive term used by North Americans. Refers to Europeans who: speak broken English, wear gaudy clothing that is probably fashionable where they come from, but isn't here; wear a severe amount of cologne and always dress like they are about to go to nightclub (even in the middle of the day); wear lots of inappropriate leather (especially leather pants), listen to bad electronic music, and rock lots of ugly-metallic jewelry. This term is usually only applied to dudes, because foreign chicks can have off style and still be hot.
