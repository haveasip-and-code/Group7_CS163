Masquatto
Masquatto is a made up word, made up by an acquaintance of the person who uses it, whose first name was Mark. The acquaintance simply was making up nicknames for himself and Mark in a game of Worms, and he called Mark Masquatto, for some reason or another. While thinking of a name for use on the internet, Mark remembered Masquatto, and went with it. He's been using that screen name ever since. ; Shorter Versions: ; Mas[q] ; Squatty
