Pugapso
A perfect example of doggie goodness resulting from a mix of [Pug] and [Lhasa Apso]. They have lots of whiskers, extra skin and the softest fur in the universe. Like Pugs they are big dogs in a small body, but they don't have breathing problems some Pugs have. ; They sometimes hog the covers and will often tickle you with their whiskers. They are completely devoted to their families (two and four legged alike). Be warned, never ever feed them liverwurst.
