Boulevard of Broken Dreams
A song by [Green Day] that has been overplayed and turned into shit. The first time I heard it I thought it was all right, but now it's been played [shitload]s of times all over the world, and if I hear it again I'm shooting somebody. It doesn't matter who, but hopefully it'll be somebody whose death will STOP THE FUCKING SONG!
