dance dance revolution
see also [ddr] ; an arcade game (although there are also versions for video game systems) where the player stands on a metal platform with 4 arrows (right, left, up, down). Arrows move up (or down if you have mad skillz) the screen, and when they hit the top the player steps on the corresponding arrow. The steps follow the beat of the music thats playing, which is where they get dancing, even though it doesnt really look like you're dancing (unless, once again, you have mad skillz and can spin and do all this other crazy stuff... takes lotsa coordination). 5 modes - beginner, light, standard, heavy, challenge. Challenge isnt too much different from heavy though. The step patterns and speed of the steps get faster/harder as the modes get harder, lotsa songs are a lot harder than others *cough*LEGEND OF MAX*cough*. really addicting, lotsa fun, awesome game. GO TO AN ARCADE AND PLAY IT, YOU LOOSER!!! =P
