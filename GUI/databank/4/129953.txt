wimpster
One of those pseudo-feminist men who pay really good lip service to feminism but somehow manage to turn any discussion about womens issues into a discussion about men ; A guy who pretends to be sensitive to women's issues in order to get ahead with women. Prone to wearing T-shirts that say things like, 'Feminists Dig Me.' Sex with a wimpster amounts to 2 minutes of random thrusting, 10 minutes of him weeping, then he falls asleep snoring. ; Wimpster - one who convincingly feigns being a feminist only as a means of career / personal advancement? ; Originally published in Bust Magazine.
