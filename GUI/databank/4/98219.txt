guinea pig
The worst pet known to man: ; 1. Guinea pigs were originally bred as food- I'm not kidding about this. ; 2. They are incredibly stupid; they just sit and stare or hurt themselves. Dogs are 1,000,000,000 x smarter. ; 3. Incredibly brittle and injury prone; they hurt their backs and break their ankles on exercise wheels, and make you by a crapload of weird supplies for them. You can let dogs walk around free, but you constantly have to make sure these fucking rats don't kill themselves. ; 4. They are not cute; they are big beady-eyed rats. Rodents aren't pets, they're VERMIN. ; The fact that there are great dogs on the street, and one of these fuckers has a home makes me SICK.
