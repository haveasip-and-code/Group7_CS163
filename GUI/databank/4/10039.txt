Molotov Cocktail
A crude yet rather effective firebomb consisting of a bottle containing flammable materials (i.e kerosene, gasoline, oil, or other flammable things) with an ignited rag at the top. Somewhat easy to make, and used sometimes by rioters, rebels, and folks who just plain want to burn things.
