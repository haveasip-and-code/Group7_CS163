kubrick
1) One of the most respected, revered and influential filmmakers in motion picture history (ref. a multitude of [Simpsons] references for just one example). Kubrick's films looked and sounded unlike anyone else's. He quickly evolved in the 1960s from an A-list Hollywood director and respectable craftsman to a master auteur, responsible for thematically, technically and aesthetically groundbreaking work. ; Some of his later films (underservedly) reached fewer people when audiences could no longer keep up with his thematic explorations of the failures of Western civilization. ; 2) A really bizarre and eclectic collection of plastic toys and figurines from [Japan], so named for no known reason. Sold at Giant Robot stores and other internet hipster-toy merchants, etc.
