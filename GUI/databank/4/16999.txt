squidfartz
Cartoonist, Cartoons -the ink-based work of an illustrator. Comes from the personal experience of cartoonist Scott Hart being ridiculed by classmates over his name... variations on which included 'Snot Fart' and 'Sqwat Farts'. Later in life, working under the nom de plume 'T. S. Hart' Squidfartz became the name of both the title and the main character of an autobigraphical weekly comic strip and unfinished book. Mr. Hart reasons this, 'I wanted to coop the abuse I endured as a child and incorporate my self expression. I am a cartoonist. A squid would fart ink. I am squidfartz and this work I have drawn... these many pages... are nothing but my squidfartz'.
