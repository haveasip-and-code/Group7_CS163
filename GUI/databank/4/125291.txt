National City
City in San Diego County's South Bay. Also known historically as 'Nasty City' for it's inner-city grit and past high crime, it's a predominantly low-income/working-class community inhabited most visibly by Latinos and Filipinos. Had been known as one of the poorest cities in California, and is still the poorest city (in terms of income) in the County, but recent civic improvements and investments, as well as improvements in law enforcement in recent years, had shown that this town is 'a city on the move.' ; The intersection of Highland Ave and Plaza Blvd was actually featured on Lil Rob's 'Summer Nights' music video. ; The people living in National City are proud, hard-working folk. Don't get it twisted.
