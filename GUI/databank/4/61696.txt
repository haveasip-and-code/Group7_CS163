isla vista
an almost too-good-to-be-true college student playground nestled in fabulous santa barbara where the apartments are absolute shit yet $650/mo to share a room. at night, IV crawls with thousands of piss-drunk students, all walking from house to house sucking up the greater half of california's vodka supply. sadly, neartly half of these party-goers are arrested by the IV foot patrol for DIPs. isla vista is an overall awesome place to spend your college years.
