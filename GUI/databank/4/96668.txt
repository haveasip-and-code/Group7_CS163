Volvo
A safe and reliable Swedish automobile that is commonly associated with College Professors, mothers with multiple children in sporting activities at different schools, and any resident of Vermont. Also known as a 'brick' or 'Swedish school bus'. Most Volvos are station wagons with nearly a dozen air bags and headlights that never turn off. Newer models are now turbocharged to nearly an inch of their life, breaking any stereotype associated thus far.
