lucker
A word which is majorativly used by retards in CounterStrike - although it's use has unfortunatly spread to other FPS (First Person Shooter) games. ; It means someone who gets 'lucky'. It is used mostly in situation where a person, considering themselves to be the best on the server (or at least better than the player he just got wasted by) says 'Lucker!!!!'. It can also be used as an incorrect replacement for 'Lucky'.
