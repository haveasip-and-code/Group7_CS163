the bisquit
A disgusting party game involving a common buttermilk bisquit(2+ male players needed). First the players form a circle (or if only 2 players, face to face) placing the bisquit in the center. Then the players [drop trow] and furiously [jack off]. When they're about to unload, they must aim their [spooge] directly at the bisquit, covering it in everyone's [jizz]. ; The last player to jizz on the bisquit (the loser of the game) has to eat the soiled pastry with everyones [jizz] on it.
