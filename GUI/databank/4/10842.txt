american football
A great sport, extremely physically demanding. Many of you foreigners keep talking about how it must not hurt because there are pads, you clearly have not played the sport. I'd like to see you guys playing linebacker with a hugeass fullback coming straight at you. Without helmets, american football would be just stupid to play, especially at the line. In America, we have a name for all of you types of people saying things like 'Americans are pansys,' maybe you've heard of it. 'Racist.'
