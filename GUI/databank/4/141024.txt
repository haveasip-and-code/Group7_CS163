Trolley Challenge
A trip made to Asda/Walmart where good times happen, food is purchased and the trolly challenge takes place. Objective is to dump as many random items in your mates trolley on the way round without him noticing. The result: your mate finding boxs of lady products next to his roast chicken at the checkout and having to ask the checkout assistant to put them back for him.
