crash bandicoot
Legend Playstation character that made his debut in 1996 in the first of the Crash Bandicoot games. In late 1997 Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back was released and to me it is still by far of the best of the Crash Games. Crash 3, CTR (Crash Team Racing), and a few other later crash games came out on the original Playstation. More recently there has been 2 Crash games on the Playstation 2 but many argue these do not compare to the older games.
