japanology
Random piece of obscure knowledge about japanese culture/history/customs that only anime dorks and japanese people really know about, but that the former consider common knowledge. ; Don't ever confess ignorance regarding these tidbits of information, as you'll probably never regain your respect amongst the 'in crowd' of anime schoolgirl-ogling again.
