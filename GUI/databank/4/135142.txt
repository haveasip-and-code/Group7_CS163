Delta Kappa Delta
Delta Kappa Delta is the first Indian Subcontinental Service Sorority of its kind, with thirteen inspirational Founding Mothers to guide this organization into what it has become today. It was founded at Texas A&M University on October 1, 1999, which is still considered the founding date of Delta Kappa Delta Sorority, Inc. because the purpose and basis of B.E.T.I.S. became the purpose and basis of Delta Kappa Delta. Even from the beginning, these ladies knew that only the purest of intents could create a bond as strong as each person who sees us will ever see- Service had truly set us free. ; Purpose: ; Delta Kappa Delta Sorority, Inc. commits itself to the fostering of a united sisterhood, the development of indomitable spirit, the betterment of the community through humanitarian services, and the education of ourselves and others about the Indian sub-continental culture. Furthermore, we dedicate ourselves to personal, cultural enrichment through the awareness and preservation of our traditions and morals.
