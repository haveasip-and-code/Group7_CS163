M16A2
Noun-Eugene Stohner's pride n' joy... the M16A2 is a later version of the M16A1, the M16A2 is slighty more reliable than the A1, another notable difference is the firing modes... A1 goes on full-auto, while the A2 is limited to 3-round-burst, this is because in the Vietnam conflict soldier's would needlessly waste thousands of rounds, because of the thought that Charlie may be hiding anywhere... and the ratio of rounds to kills was about 1,000 rounds for one kill.
