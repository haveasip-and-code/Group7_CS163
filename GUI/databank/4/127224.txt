Bad Poetry Face
The slim shrug of the lips you make, kind of like an 'all righty' in the country manner, whilst nodding your head, when you're hearing really bad poetry. As if you've got to pass gas. As if you've got a pitcher of beer in your bladder and the moron poet keeps on reading. You share this look with a friend, who is also making the bad poetry face. This poetry sucks ass. The poet sucks ass. He is a 'sucker butthole.'
