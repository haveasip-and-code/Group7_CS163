hic-burp
This is when you nearly hiccup, but instead of 'cupping' you burp instead. ; This usually occurs after after a post-meal smoke. ; You have a meal, then go for a ciggarette. Normally after the first puff you experience the 'hic-burp'. ; And the more you try to stop it from occuring, the worse it gets. And don't even try to speak.
