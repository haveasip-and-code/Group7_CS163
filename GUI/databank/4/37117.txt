syracuse
Peice of shit city 60 miles west of rochester, crappy looking, good NCAA team, billboard that says 'welcome to ondaga county, home of Basketball, Rapists, murderers, and general retards.' Have a crappy lake that only 2 people ever swim in, because food lion dumps all their chemicals in it, old middle class houses full of black people who think they are ghetto,next to 60 year old factories and BJ's and Target Warehouses.The Mall is the high point of Syracuse social life. It has the only big movie complex, after all. Other than the mall, there is several downtown dance clubs where no one dances, some Irish pubs, maybe two live music venues, one coffeehouse, and the usual quotient of dim bars where middle aged men drink in the early afternoon. right next to the Ny state fairground is a huge chemical plant/factory that looks 100 years old. City that is crap to anyone over 13. Avoid at all costs.
