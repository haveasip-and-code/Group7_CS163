queens of the stone age
An art rock band. In an age where Chevelle, Trapt, and Hoobastank turn rock radio into shit; QOTSA comes and ressurects rock music. There music is extremely melodic, with a common beat and melody throughout the song, then they add awesome riffs that are really experimental sounding. Lullabies to Paralyze is the best album ever. ; Most people don't have the attention span to appreciate Queens of the Stone Age,their songs don't pick up until part way into the song.
