Low Definition
An extremely [bodge] and [pretend] implementation of High Definition, Digital TV. Still uses MPEG compression but has a resolution of 576 lines, progressive (p) and is usually chronically over compressed. Low Definition is still widescreen but only ever offers 2 channel Dolby Digital AC-3 surround sound.
