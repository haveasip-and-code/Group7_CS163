lives in a movie
'eats movies' can also be used to describe someone who's very confused and worried about the outcome of his deeds (after doing a bad thing, even if unintended). ; Moreover, 'get out of the movie' is a phrase someone tells the other, when he's talking bullshit or when he (the speaker) doesn't beleive the other guy.
