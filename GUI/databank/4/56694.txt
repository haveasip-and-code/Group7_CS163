Blitzkreig
The act of quickly moving your hand on an intercept course with the genitals of a nearby member of the opposite sex. The swift act of aggression is named for it's inspiration, Hitler's 'lightning war' on Poland. Here, the hands are the Panzer division, whilst the genitalia are poor, helpless Poland. Poor, poor Polacks.
