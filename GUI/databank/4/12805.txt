dashboard confessional
Dashboard Confessional is to emo what Good Charlotte is to punk. Some may call them poseurs (for a very good reason...), and others may listen to them every night before they go to sleep. If you listen to them, that's great. If you don't, stop whining about it to the people who do. We all have lives.
