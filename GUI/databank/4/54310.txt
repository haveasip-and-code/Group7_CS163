PAX
The best gaming convention/festival in the world. ; In 2004 Gabe and Tycho of Penny-Arcade.com wanted to attend a con that had equal parts tabletop gaming, computer gaming, and video gaming--and that wasn't just a big marketing event for some lame corporation. They didn't find any, so they decided to make their own. ; Thus was the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) born. The first show drew over 4,000 gamers from all over the world to bear witness to 48 hours of nonstop gaming, four nerdcore concerts by the likes of Optimus Rhyme and MC Frontalot, the world public playable premier of Halo 2, and the 2-day multigenre $25,000 Omegathon tournament (which culminated in a final match of: Pong).
