padussy
The wrong way to spell [budussy]. Or [bodussy] (both pronounced the same way). ; Spelled by white people from the suburbs that just heard it before and ran to urbandictionary.com with excitement to tell everyone about this new word they heard. ; Because it stands for butt/booty, dick, and pussy, there has to be a 'B' somewhere. Common sense will tell you that. ; Originally came from the movie 'How To Be a Player' in 1997.
