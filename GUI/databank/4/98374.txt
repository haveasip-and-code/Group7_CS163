teen movie
1. A movie that is aimed at the stereotype teen-ager, which usually features the popular football player or cheerleader falling in love with their supermodel-wannabe dreamlover. These movies features crappy jokes, keg parties, sex, and everything else that most teen-agers never experience in their high school years. Much like the Barbie, it perpetuates a false image of the typical teen-ager lifestyle and can only be realized during a drug induced dream. ; 2. A shock-comedy movie, featuring jokes, situations, and gags that is supposed to make you say, 'I can't believe that happened/they did that.' These movies are overpraised and STILL not funny. Usually features sex, nudity, drinking, drugs and the cocky, popular, arrogant football player/cheerleader getting their way. Again, falsely perpetuating the teen-age life style that so many adults and parents based their view of teen-agers off of.
