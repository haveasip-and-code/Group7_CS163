Grundler
Slight spin-off of the creature Grendel from the epic poem Beowulf. Basically, a Grundler is the filthiest beast ever imaginable that lurks in your basement. The Grundler is actually an overweight man and has a rancid beard. The Grundler lurks in the shadows waiting for the opportunity to 'bag-and-tag' a helpless victim.
