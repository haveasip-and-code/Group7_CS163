Winchester  MA
Winchester is an interesting suburb to the northwest of boston, about fifteen minutes away on the commuter rail, and home to a shifting teenage demographic which varies over time between independent and friendly and alcoholic and hateful, although the alcohol is pretty consistent, as is the jockness, but as much as they change they're always just the same as their parents - rich. ; Some interesting people have appeared here, though. ; Slang is unique. Most words end in izzy. Worthless people are called vus. Like if someone starts a fight, freaks out, backs their car really fast into someone they don't even know's car, then drives away, people will call after him 'vuuuuuuuuu' before bolting from the Winchester Police Department. Or is someone gets heartbroken, and sends naked pictures of his exgirlfriend to her future professors at the college she's planning to go to before she gets a restraining order on him, the community will have labeled him a 'vu' by nightfall. ; Very critical town. No one knows where this old tradition comes from. ; Come visit! Exit 32b on 93!
