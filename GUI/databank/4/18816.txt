Halo
1. An overrated (okay game) for XBOX. Multiplayer provides untactical strategy most of the time. It has many flaws though, such as horrible and numerous [glitches] that people on halo online like to exploit because they are stupid and have nothing else to do within their lives. Single Player for Halo 1 was good while the[Halo 2] plot was blown to shit. ; 2. A game often played by numerous little kids who cry, swear, be racist (of course) and are like two year olds and the only game they play is Halo online because they can't afford a good computer to play games like Farcry. Usually young/annoying. They also usually play it for 10 hours straight because they are so incredulously stupid. see also [annoying kids] ; 3. Shitty game because of an online auto-aim system. See also [wtf]and [shitty game] ; 4. A game that influences kids to be stupid and dropout from school and swear at their parents. Often used as an influence to use the 'leet 2 year old' language. It also influences the kids to play the same game over and over and mistake them to say it is the best game in the world meanwhile they've never played a good game.
