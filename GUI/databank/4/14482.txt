Styx
One of the greatest American rock bands ever formed. With a long active career that lasted from the early 70s to the mid 80s, Styx scored numerous hits such as 'The Grand Illusion', 'Blue Collar Man', 'Pieces of Eight', 'Babe', 'Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)', 'Too Much Time On My Hands', and 'Love Is The Ritual'. ; As other people have mentioned on here, Styx does have a similar sound to REO Speedwagon. That is because they play related forms of rock music, and they are both from Illinois, which explains the identical-sounding vocals.
