The Wirral
A non existant area of land within Merseyside home to ex Liverpool suburbs such as Tranmere and Prenton. With Wales also a mere 10 miles away there is a high cultural draw from both the likes of Liverpool and North Wales which has produced activities such as Welsh Folk Dancing in a shell-suit and sheep-hurling.
