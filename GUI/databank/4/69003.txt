Tyrant
'Cold and Silent' ; The re-occuring boss in the Resident Evil Series. Unlike zombies or B.O.W, most of umbrella's time and money goes into these creations. Usally tops 8' in height and wields blade like claws. Players meet the monster at the end of the game where they fight it under a countdown timer. Never Disappointing...
