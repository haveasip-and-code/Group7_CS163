advance wars
A turn-based military strategy game for the Gameboy Advance. The game has a tile-and grid system, where each tile contains a type of terrain, such as plains, woods, or rivers. Each tile has special properties. Units and building facilities are placed on the map, where armies battle it out. The objective is to either destroy all enemy units or capture the enemy headquarters. The story, or 'campaign' mode, pits the 4 countries of Wars World (Orange Star, Blue Moon, Yellow Comet, and Green Earth) to defeat the invading alien Black hole army led by Sturm. One thing that makes this game a lot more fun is a map designer. Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising was later released on the Gameboy Advance in 2003 and included a new unit: the Neotank, an extremely powerful tank. Both games are decsendants of the Japan-only Famicom Wars, Gameboy Wars, and Super Famicom Wars series.
