gooma-zay-guam Thursday
A generic name for any Jewish holiday. The Hebrew names are too hard to pronounce, so I just call all the Jewish holidays gooma-zay-guam Thursday, regardless of what day of the week they fall on. I'm just glad to be off on them; it's something that only happens here in Jew York City.
