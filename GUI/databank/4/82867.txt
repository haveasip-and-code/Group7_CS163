Utada Hikaru
A very popular, (in japan) j-popper, who didn't quite do good in america, which is a good thing, because the last thing we need are crazed j-pop fans, taking away the foreigness (not a word, I know) of j-pop. Has a head the shape of a bowling ball, can't make up her mind on her image (Cubic U, Hikaru, Utada Hikaru, and her recent America debut) ; None the less, I still admire her for her lyrics, her voice, her motivation.
