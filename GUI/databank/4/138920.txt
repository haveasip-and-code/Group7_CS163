Gill St. Bernard's
N. An extremely wealthy and affluent private K-12 school located in Gladstone, New Jersey. Extremely small, Gill is known for its unseemingly tiny population of sheltered rich kids with popped collars and Birkenstocks, who leave high school well versed in the menu at Dunkin Donuts, the seasonal colors for Lacoste's fall season, how to be an incredible elitist, and every crevice of the Bridgewater Commons and Far Hills Malls. Nonetheless, a small population of Gill is composed of stoners and hippies with rich grandfathers who pay for their educations. Cocaine and marijuana are drugs of choice.
