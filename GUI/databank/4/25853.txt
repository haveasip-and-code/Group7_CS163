Ben Wallace
A six foot nine NBA Center. Never drafted by a NBA franchise, but signed as a rookie free agent to the Washington Bullets in 1996, where he spent 3 seasons before being traded to the Orlando Magic then traded to the Detroit Pistons a year later, where he plays now. A great defensive player who has averaged 6 points and 10 rebounds in his career. He is also a dick sucking piece of black fagshit who enjoys strolls on the beach with men named Molly.
