malcolm glazer
1.) The new owner of Manchester United, which has really upset those fans that haven't started to support their local teams (i.e, Chelsea or Arsenal) at a really convenient time, yet they cannot seem to put together a rational argument about why he isn't good for the club - especially when they bleat about him turning the club into a business when he patently isn't. Martin Edwards did that a decade ago, didn't you know? Then again, MUPLC fans were bleating about Magnier and McManus a couple of years ago for similar reasons. ; 2.) Owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFL, which means he just needs to buy an Australian Rules team to get the full set.
