Might be the only musician that played in G3 to ever have any musical soul whatsoever. Great, great guitarist. Yes, ok, he can get wankery. But most of the time it's with a melody, the music has a point, it's not just shredding and getting nowhere (but getting nowhere faster than your head can register). Taught Vai, so Vai might have musical soul (haven't heard him, can't really tell) and of course, he taught Kirk Hammett.
