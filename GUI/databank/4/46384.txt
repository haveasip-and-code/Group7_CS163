Free Ipods
Great example of false advertising. Instead of paying direct cash for an overpriced mp3 player, you succumb to the soul craving corporate conglomerates by signing up for any number of 'offers.' A successfull offer earns credit towards a free ipod. These 'offers' tend to be premium (read: costly) coupon saving subscriptions and/or skin cream demos. The only hitch is trying to cancel a subscription to said offer. After completing the offer, all you have to do is force 5 people to do the same.
