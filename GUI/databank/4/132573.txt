Natty Reefer
A nickname given to Natural Resources students at Cornell University in Ithaca New York. The nickname has the connotation that all natural resources students are 'reefers' or smoke weed. This is not very far from the truth. This fun-loving bunch of tree-huggers embrace this nickname and others in their typical laid-back, outdoorsy manner.
