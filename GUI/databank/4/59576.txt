mosh pit
Mosh pit- real pits are found at hardcore shows. Done when a hardcore band has fast bass beats. A bunch of people at a show have an area where they hardcore dance - floor punch, spin kick, wind mill, ext. also in large groups many people link together and knock into as many people as possible. most of them are skinheads, not nescasaraly racist skinheads. It's polite to pick up a fellow mosher that has been knocked over. Metal pits are full of drunk men that fall into eachother and act like monkeys on heroin.
