feeldoe
A unique strapless [dildo] made by Tantus. The 'pony' end goes into the [vagina] of the [giver] (held in place by the [Kegel] muscles), and ridges on the 'saddle' serve to stimulate her [clitoris]. The 'horse' end is used to penetrate her partner. ; While the toy was designed with [lesbian]s in mind, it can also be used by heterosexual couples, allowing the woman to [peg] her man. Unlike traditional [strap-on] [dildo]s, the feeldoe stimulates the woman's [naughty bits] as she thrusts away.
