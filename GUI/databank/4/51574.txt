progress quest
1. n. A satirical game where the only player input is race and class selection, and starting stat rolls. The game consists of a windowed collection of all the finest aspects of a role-playing game, and progress bars to represent various aspects of your character, with no purpose other than to give the player the comfort of 'watching their numbers go up' without so much as lifting a finger. ; 2. v. To reach a point in an RPG where achieving any goal is simply a matter of following an algorithmic process.
