salvia
Salvia is an incredibly intense hallucinogen. Salvia can be smoked or digested. It is an organic substance, and is perfectly legal in the U.S. because no group has made enough of an issue about it for it to become illegal. A normal dosage will give you a high that lasts about five minutes, and an afterglow of about an hour. It is safer to have a sitter present, especially when trying it for the first time, increasing dosages, or mixing it with other substances. NEVER mix salvia with other hallucinogens or alcohol. Doing so can result in 'unperdictable results' such as extremely negative experiances, and trips lasting much much longer than they should.
