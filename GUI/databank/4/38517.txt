Total Annihilation
Chris Taylor's 'T.A' (Cavedog 1997) is slightly famous amongst RTS enthusiasts for being a ground-breaking real time strategy game. ; There were only two sides - 'The Arm' and 'The Core' - cloned humans and robots respectively with essentially similar units, although Core units tended to be tougher and slower. The game made up for this by having a LOT of units (Air, Naval, Ground, Amphibious, Commanders that nuked themselves when they died) and buildings (particularly a massive number of fixed gun emplacement types), (effectively) endless resources (Metal and Energy), and comprehensive control options. ; This game was best experienced with the expansion 'The Core Contingency' - or 'C.C' (eg: Submersible Aircraft, Anti Radar and Anti Sonar units, more Submarines, AA Ships...) together with still more official downloadable Cavedog units (eg: FARK's, Mobile Anti-Nuclear Missile Units). Has it been mentioned that this game had a LOT of units? ; Cavedog used to run 'Boneyards' (similar to Blizzard's 'Battlenet') which was the optimal place to enjoy T.A in multiplayer. Players could elect to play for either side in a constantly refreshed galaxy of planets - where the results of one's games would decide whether the Arm or Core dominated at any given time. Boneyards also had an military style ranking system based on a player's wins. ; In closing, T.A was a remarkable game for its time and for sheer strategic and tactical options it would compare favourably with any RTS currently on the market. ; T.A has a LOT of units. ; NB: There is an 'unofficial sequel' to this game being developed by Chris Taylor (now at Gas Powered Games)called 'Supreme Commander'.
