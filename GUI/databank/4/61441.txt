Saltwater Taffy
A great, old-fashioned candy that has been around since 1892. Made in Salt Lake City, [Utah], this chewy candy consists of flavors that include licorice, peppermint, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, rum, orange and cream, and blue raspberry. I love this wonderful candy, and you can find it in many grocery stores, including Meijer's, and it is also made in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where it is also a speciality item.
