GGA
Founded by John Thibodeau (aka [geej]) in 1994, the GGA (Gay Guys Anonymous) is an establishment run by gays for gays. John felt that people like himself (pedophiles, sheep rapers, homosexuals, transexuals, and necropheliacs) could have a place to express themselves freely. John, the freaky sex offenders of the world touch and thank you.
