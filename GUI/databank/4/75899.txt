the big o
The semi-official, fresh-from-marketing nickname for Omaha, Nebraska. Latest in a number of slogans designed to give Omaha an 'image', this one seems to have stuck, the fact that it has not enhanced Omaha's image one jot notwithstanding. Most commonly used in 'buy the big O'; i.e., keep your dollars in the local economy.
