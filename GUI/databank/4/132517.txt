bamerNek
A football fan of the University of Alabama @ Tuskaloosa, known as UAT in the state of Alabama. BamerNeks attend football games with a Tide soap box, roll of toilet paper(sometimes used), a pair of baggy overalls w/one strap undone(they think thats sexy) and a baseball cap with a red A on it! They say 'Roll Tide' a lot, hence the props! Also they talk a lot about a dead bear!!
