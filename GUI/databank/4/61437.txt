bo-duke it
first of all, bo duke was a charachter on the dukes of hazzard played by john schnider, he used to do hood slides. ; a bo duke is a hood slide acrost the top of a hood. Actually its more of a vault over the hood with your legs kind of dragging and you butt hits the last part of the hood so it looks like a slide. ; its more of a style/visual thing than a function.
