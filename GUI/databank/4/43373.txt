Erik Destler
Erik Destler is the name of 'The Phantom' in one of the versions of 'The Phantom of the Opera', one of the really crap ones actually. Although the name Erik is universally accepted as the Phantom's name, the surname is only used when referring to the completely 80's horror movie staring Robert Englund A.K.A. Freddy from Freddy vs. Jason. Although this movie totally blows, it's still part of the 'phantomverse' and therefore has a special place in my heart.
