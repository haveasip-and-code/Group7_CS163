General Discussion
A forum on the popular anime roleplay site, Gaia Online. It houses some of the most intelligent people, and some of the dumbest. Mostly, the General Discussion is for those who know the ropes of Gaia Online, and who know how to type with proper grammar. Those exempt to this rule are the more prominent members of General Discussion, because basically it's, to quote one user, 'Our fuckin' GD'. ; The General Discussion also has it's own personal radio show, hosted by the esteemed Erik Ferris, who is, to most in the General Discussion, God in his purest form.
