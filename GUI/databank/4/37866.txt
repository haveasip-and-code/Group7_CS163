Theodore G.
The funniest french bastard ever, who likes to 'do homework' and 'go outside for a little bit' because he is such a good little French boy. He loves Starwars and even though he says the most racist things ever, he doesn't really mean it, and it's usually funny. May Theo go out through history and the 'Funny French Boy Who Could'
