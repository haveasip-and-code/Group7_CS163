JP2 High School
[Pope John Paul 2 High School]...[JP2] is the second co-ed Catholic high school located in Nashville, TN. They want to be exactly like Father Ryan which is where they get the nickname...FR2. The only difference between the two schools is that FR has more class. Oh yea, and FR has a bigger gym! FR beat them in soccer and basketball. FR beat them in baseball, wrestling, softball, lacrosse and come to think of it, even though FR may not be great in football, they beat them in that too. Guess they really are living up to their name, FR2. yay go Irish! wait, i mean Knights
