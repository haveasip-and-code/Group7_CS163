scene
One of the latest trend or style. ; Some scene girls and boys tend to use black and short hair. They cut it themselves to make it look messy but tidy. ; If they have a myspace, all they're pictures are from every possible angle. They like to take black and white pictures of themselves, too. ; When they type, instead of writing 'and...' they use '&&...'. They love to use 'gangsta' chatspeak and in their space they have at least 1 'gangsturr' picture. They usually don't use capitalization, correct grammar and periods. ; Scene people use colored clothes, generally with prints saying 'bang', 'gun', etc. And wear tight pants, generally ragged on some parts. ; They also love colored plastic pearls-made necklaces and piercings. Most of the time they like to act childish. ; They like children's stuff like little girls hair accesories, dinosaurs,etc. ; Some of them like to pretend being a 'ninja'. ; Being scene means tons of make-up, specially on the eyes. Some may use the 'doll' look, a white face, with red cheeks.
