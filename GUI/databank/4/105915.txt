Converse
A brand of shoes that have been around for as long as anyone could remember. Recently they have become a trend for those who wish to promote fashion or those who consider themselves 'rebellious.' Little do these losers know, Converse shoes are owned by NIKE and made in sweatshops. Nothing says rebellion like child labor.
