House Party Weekend
An annual celebration at Bucknell University, PA. This does not even try to be anything else but a weekend of bands, booze, sex, and drugs. Almost everyone wakes up at the end with something stupid they did. Also, one of the most enjoyable weekends on campus. Main goal of everyone on campus is to get laid and stay away from Public Safety.
