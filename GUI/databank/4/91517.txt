WIlton
a town in connecticut with a mix of ghettonians,(none of them however are actually black) major preps who work their whole lives to master the whole preppy vibe so you can walk down the street and say, 'wow what a prep' without even saying a word to them. This town also has their share of punk rockers who skateboard down the small, lonely downtown which consists of maybe five stores and twice as many grocery stores but for the poor wiltonians, its all they have. And of course we have the goths who scare the living daylights out of everyone they walk by except for of course their fellow gothic friends. Wilton probably has the worst high school drinking problems in the state. Wilton public schools is one of the best school sysytems in the country. I guess the health classes must suck though, because they still cant seem to get through to the kids about drugs and alcohol. Sure, its an awkward town but its a group of good looking kids who seem to get along with everyone and know how to have a good time.
