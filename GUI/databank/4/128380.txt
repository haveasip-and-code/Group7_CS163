Smeg-meg
The female counter-part to nut-meg in soccer. It is when a soccer ball is intentionally, cleanly, and successfully directed through the gap created by a girl's (the victim's) planted legs during soccer. This usually causes a momentary stun/deer-in-the-headlights reaction from the victim because of the initial shock and disbelief of what just happened. There must be an intent on the offender's part to shoot the gap with the ball for a smeg-meg to occur. If it happens accidentally, an official smeg-meg did not occur. I came up with this one circa 1990.
