napa
A small wine vine-growing town in the North Bay area. ; The population is about 50-50 whites to other ethnic groups. It's NOT 92% white, not even close, so M. Du, shut up. ; At the junior college, whites are a minority. I live here, I know this. ; And we like being called Napkins, it's a funny term we enjoy. Nap-kins. Yessss. ; We also have a state hospital to get locked up in if we're naughty. ; There is NOTHING to do in this town. We're bored out of out minds. Seriously. ; ..and we don't hate surrounding towns. ; If you're a tourist and you come to visit - drive the speed limit. Nothing gets people crazier than being behind drivers going 30 in a 45 zone.
