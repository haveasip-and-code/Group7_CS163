operations
The word operations can derive from the phrase of peacekeeping operations. Which stands for one of the 16 peacekeeping operations. I.E. India and Pakistan's disputes would be one of the peace keeping operations. The way operations is used couldn't possibly mean all of the peacekeeping operations at once, the reason our current literature uses the word Operations with an S at the end only because there are so many operations among the United Nations. In this case, the S doesn't make the word plural. By making it plural the word would mean more than one operation in this word. Though, this word isn't plural.
