band bus
A bus full of band/colorguard/drumline people usually a long ride going to a band review/event. During the bus ride colorguard and drumlines usually sit together and play sick versions of truth or dare and makeout. Also the fact that at the end of the bus ride everyone has to change out of there clothes and into their uniforms...basically it is a bus full of barley clothed guys and girls....yeah u can just imagine the rest
