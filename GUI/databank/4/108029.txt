loyola blakefield
Right in [Towson] the basic prep lax principles apply but common at this school is the waffle. Everyone wears one and no one outside of the school knows to much about them except they get them on Kairos. During the school day frisbee or lying on the hill is the activity of choice. School games are heavily attended by heavily intoxicated kids. Weekends roll around and loyola students spread across the county. The majority of social functions in the surrounding area have several loyola kids in attendance with their natural light or cheap plastic handle. Uncommonly found at this school would be white trash or any diversity.
