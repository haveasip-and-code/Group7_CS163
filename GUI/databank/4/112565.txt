Casey Leblanc
Currently a top 5 contestant on Canadian Idol 3. Casey's success is due mainly to regional voting, with some help from her fanbase, the 'NutCaseys', and the website 'Vote For the Worst.' With very little stage presence and only an OK voice, Casey has earned the nickname 'Corpsey Lebland.'
