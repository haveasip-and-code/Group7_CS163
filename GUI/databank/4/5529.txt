Post-Punk
Catch-all term mainly for bands during the late 70s and early 80s who were punk yet 'not punk enough.' Trends amongst these bands included artsiness as in odd musical timing and signitures, off-beat hooks and . Mostly said to come after the death of punk in 77 and after the sex pistols broke up of that same year. While often refuted some say Wire was the first post punk band but so many of these bands formed during 76/77 (yet only found a distinct sound later in their careers?) that one can hardly know for sure. Post-punk would later spawn countless short lived musical subgenres such as goth rock. Post-punk technically died in the mid-80's and evolved into college rock and alternative rock.
