MOBIUS CELL
Where person 'A' makes a cell phone call to person 'B', gets their voice mail, begins to leave a message. Meanwhile person 'B' sees the missed call, phones person 'A' from THEIR cell, and gets person 'A's voice mail, leaving a message to call them back. meanwhile, Person 'A' finishes the message for person 'B', see's that they have missed a call from person 'B' and call them back, only to get the voice mail again, because person 'B' is doing the same... the cycle continues as long as the participants do not pause to let the other person through.
