compassionate conservative
The phrase used by George Bush during his campagin to show his more affectionate side. It's like a redneck shooting cans with a paintball gun rather than a rifle to be more affection. To get a better understanding read the story of the lions: ; One day, one lion said to another 'compassionate predator...i like it'
