pop psych ; NOT studied by four members of girlie mouse. Pop psych is the rubbish that is spouted on TV about relationships, mind reading and body language. If you are doing a psychology degree, you may find yourself being questioned by friends on said topics. It is perfectly acceptable to peanut butter pirate them in rage
