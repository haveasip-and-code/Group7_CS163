steeped
The method that Tim Horton's (a Canadian doughnut chain) uses to make tea. In a 2005 commercial, it takes on a new meaning as a mother misinterprits steeped to mean cool. Now steeped is being used in popular culture to mean cool or great. Being told that something of yours is steeped should be taken as a compliment (or you just have some good tea).
