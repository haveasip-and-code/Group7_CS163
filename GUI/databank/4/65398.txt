USSR
A country that didn't have a single preemtive plan for an attack on the USA. The USA had dozens of plans to attack the USSR. Now, who's the evil empire? ; Not the same thing as Russia. ; To the bigoted asshole who posted the 'shity,but slightly intimidating' bit: Why do you think Reagan was so eager to sign an arms reduction treaty? He was terrified of the ss18 missiles. Slightly intimidating my ass. ; The nation that: ; Built first peaceful nuclear installation in the world. ; Sent the first man into space. ; Landed the first probes on Mars, Venus and the moon. ; Sent the first woman into space. 20 years before Sally Ride. ; Build the first successful spacestation. ; Did just about everything in space first, except for landing on the moon. ; Defeated Nazi Germany. Seriously now, 7 out of 10 german units, and about 9/10 ss units was on the Eastern front, not at Normandy. No insult intended, its the truth. ; And yes ; It is also the nation that fucked up in Afghanistan, an ; Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Sorry.
