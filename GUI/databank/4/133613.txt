Bloomer Crickets
Bloomer Crickets are slang for Pubic Lice Infestation. Also called 'crabs,' pubic lice are parasitic insects found in the genital area of humans. Infection is common and found worldwide. ; Pubic lice are usually spread through sexual contact. Rarely, infestation can be spread through contact with an infested person's bed linens, towels, or clothes. A common misunderstanding is that infestation can be spread by sitting on a toilet seat. This isn't likely, since lice cannot live long away from a warm human body. Also, lice do not have feet designed to walk or hold onto smooth surfaces such as toilet seats. ; Infection in a young child or teenager may indicate sexual activity or sexual abuse.
