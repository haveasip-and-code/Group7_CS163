ocean city
Ocean City, Maryland...the best and only place to be in the summer. A great place to make fun of the tourons(tourist/morons) who don't know where to find the really good seafood. Where my favorite reastaraunt Hoopers is located and my boy Spike...don't forget Tequila Mockingbird and of course the boardwalk. OC MD is the REAL OC i don't care what anyone says
