Meadowbrook
The hottest of the hots live in Meadowbrook. Filled with the million dollar houses, do NOT confuse it with Jenkintown or Rockledge (ghetto town) even though we share the same 5- digits. All of us party like there isn't any tomorrow, live like we're dying, shop till we drop, drive in the newest Benz, Audi. Some of our pops even zoom around town in the Bentley. It all about the MEADOW-not to be confused with the cheap apartments of the same name in H-valley. We are SO not cheap people.
