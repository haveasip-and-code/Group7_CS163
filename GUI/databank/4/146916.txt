Gelgoog
A line of mobile suits produced by Zeon toward the end of the the [One Year War]. The Gelgoog outclassed most mobile suits of the time, and some of its later variations, produced in extremely small numbers shortly before Zeon's defeat at A Baoa Qu, were even stronger (variants such as the Gelgoog Jaeger, High Mobility Type, Marine, etc.). ; Some argue that if the Gelgoog had been produced earlier in the conflict, Zeon would have been victorious, however the Gelgoog was simply too little, too late.
