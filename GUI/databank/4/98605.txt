Trust Company
Ok. HOOOOOOOOOOOLD ON. I wouldn't say these guys are the greatest band on Earth. You obviously haven't listened to other bands, or maybe you're just a pansy that doesn't enjoy heavier music. But there's no doubt that these guys ARE good. Their first album, The Lonely Position Of Neutral, had about 3 songs that sounded the same. This album also had some great screaming parts. Their second album, True Parallels, is VERY different. You can tell the band has matured and gotten better as musicians. The lead singer, Kevin Palmer, has a soft voice, but can belt out the screams when needed. I would compare Trust Company to... maybe Story Of The Year.
