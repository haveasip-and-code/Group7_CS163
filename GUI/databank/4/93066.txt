Moorestown Lacrosse
A pathetic attempt to be a GOOD lacrosse team... they call themselves the 'M-pire' they are currently #2 in the nation... seeing as they cannot seem to beat Mt. Hebron lacrosse (#1) The entire team (JV and V) look like men and play like men... Also, duing the course of a game... this team will do ANNOYING cheers to ATTEMPT to pump up their team... they always seem to do these cheers when they are losing... The Moorestown Quakers, a pathetic excuse for a sports team
