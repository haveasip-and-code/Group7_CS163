Yeshua
Meaning Salvation in Hebrew. Commonly replaced with Jesus, which is a greek form on the Messiah's name. ; Yeshua was not called Yashuah, as some think, because the Seraphim did not tell Miriam that his name was Yahshua(Yahweh is our Salvation), but rather Yeshua (Salvation). ; 'And you shall call him SALVATION.'
