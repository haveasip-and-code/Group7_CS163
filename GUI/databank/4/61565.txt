Lexington  Ma
Suburb outside of Boston known for its Revolutionary war history. Huge property values are reflected in the supposed quality of the public schools, which are in turn a breeding ground for the apathetic and dissilusioned youth of a rich town who have nothing to do but smoke pot, get drunk, and fuck up in school.
