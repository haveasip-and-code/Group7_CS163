Urban RPS
a popular myth/culture/pastime/extreme sport (if done at high altitude), pioneered by myself and one d. loxham. the game consists of two players entering the name of a popular urban personality eg [dr. pimp] into google image search, thanks to the random and frankly spastic like hand gestures of said urban personalities, it is more than likely that one of the resulting images will contain a gesture resemling one of those in the 'popular' game rock, paper, scissors. the results are then shown and the loser is pronounced 'wack' or something.
