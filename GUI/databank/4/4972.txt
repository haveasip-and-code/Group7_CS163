Fight club
FIGHT CLUB! thats all I have to say. Your not suppouse to talk about it but still. HEre we go. THIS MOVIE was created by a genius. The cinematic feature is none other but art. The way the screen play comes into action, the fight scenes are a work of GOD and the Story plot is something from heaven. This movie is worth ; seeing over a hundred times until your sick from watching it.....AND THEN REWINDE IT and watch it a hundred times more. I am Jacks colon. FIGHT CLUB a work of God.
