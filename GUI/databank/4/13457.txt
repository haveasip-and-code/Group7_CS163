881
In [Mandarin] [Chinese], the number 8 is prounounced 'ba' and the number 1 is pronounced 'yi'. Put them together and you get 'ba-ba-yi' which when spoken fast sounds a bit like 'ba-bye' which sounds like the english 'bye-bye'. Possibily originated from [Taiwan], [Singapore], or [China]. ; I wonder where these other entries came up with their crap. You all just got [schooled].
