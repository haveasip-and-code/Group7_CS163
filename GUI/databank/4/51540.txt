Sluff
Noun. The snow that is set into movement when snowboarding or skiing in steep terrain (above 40 degrees). Due to the often loose cohesion of the [powder]s top layer, more snow can be accumulated by the already moving snow. If the slope is sufficiently steep for a a couple hundred meters, the sluff can get very fast. One turn on top of a steep face can cause a sluff that reaches avalanche-like proportions. ; A relatively small sluff can knock a snowboarder/skier off his feet and take him for a fast and dangerous ride down to the end of the slope or over a cliff. ; Sluff is one of the mayor difficulties in big mountain snowboarding/skiing, yet it also presents an interesting challenge and is very spectacular to watch. The techniques to deal with sluff while riding are called [sluff management].
