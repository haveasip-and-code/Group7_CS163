Put on Her Dash
A phrase used to describe an insanely hot person. Etymological history comes from the following exchange: If a person is incredibly good looking, they are 'mind boggling'. If the person is 'mind boggling', then by seeing her your 'head is boggled'. If your 'head is boggled', then you are essentially a 'bobble head'. If you are a 'bobble head', the person of affection can then 'put you on her dash' for decoration.
