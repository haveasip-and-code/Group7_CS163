Fairfield County
im lovin how no one writing definitions for this place live in it. First off, it is pretty rich, i'll give u that, but that doesnt mean that everyone's extremely stuck up. So what if my family owns auddis and a lexus, doesnt mean im goin to go around showing off the fact that i do. But sadly, we do have a few people who are like that, but no one likes them anyway. And there's also a good number of kids who are not popped collar stuck up preppy kids. And yes, houses are ridiculously overpriced around here, especially around the beaches. Also, we do have quite a lot of underage drinking, but when u have easy access, y not.
