w.o.p.
still means with out papers, ; this was a problem for many italians when they were immigrating from the homeland, they didn't bring any papers with them, i don't know if my greatgradfather had this problem but it is one that many of our ancestors faced it's just directed towards the italian population, it can be used as a demeaning term to put down someone that is italian when you yourself are not, my friend calls me a w.o.p all the time and i call him a [mic] cause he's irish.
