clownstep
A sub genre of Drum and Bass, charecterised by big 'wobbly' basslines with a simple structure, usually consisting of a 3 note progression. The swing beat is used excessively in this simplistic form of dnb. These travesties of electronic music are popular with pill munching plebs who delight in nothing better than flailing their arms about and jumping up and down like a muppet plugged into the mains socket. This phenomena seems to generate a lot of money for the producers of such a formulaic style due to the 'common raver' being the lowest common denominator the dj has to cater for.
