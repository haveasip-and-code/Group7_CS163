jap
Jewish American Prince, can also me used for males. These male japs reside in the upper-middle class suburbs of philadelphia. Tehy think they are city people, simply because they eat cheesesteaks and are sports fans. Their families flaunt their pretty much non-existant wealth by leasing expensive Lexus SUV's while telling they rest of the synagogue that they baught it.
