Japanocentric
Having anything and everything to do with Japan and their idosyncracies. Most commonly associated with the excessive use of over-popular anime cartoon stylization of just about everything (spiked blue hair, tiny closed mouth / massive open mouth, and almond eyes). ; May also refer to the marketing techniques used in Japan which fail miserably in the United States (a la Nintendo).
