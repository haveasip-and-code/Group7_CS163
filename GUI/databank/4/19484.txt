Mullered.
a friend of ours in a big group of friends kept kicking our asses in pool all the time. His name was Rob Muller. So, when you miss a shot in pool, and you think you should of made it, and everyone in the group playing the game agrees, you say 'ive been [Mullered.]'..... therefore, robbed of your decent shot... Also, if you loose any kind of competition, in general, you can also say you were [mullered]. Basically, replacing the word 'robbed' with the word [mullered]. Our friends name was Rob [Muller].
