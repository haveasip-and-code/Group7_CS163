test fart
Basically when you're around people (not alone) and you really have to blast one, so much so that your stomache is starting to ache... so you let out a small amount of gas in hopes of it being a quiet or non-smelly fart. If it smells or is a blastus you hold it back, but if it's a quiet one you walk around and pass the gas in a discreet fashion.
