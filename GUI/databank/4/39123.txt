Red Dwarf
Genius sci-fi sitcom where humanity is (almost) extinct. Spawned the word [Smeg] as well as various classic gags. Brilliantly written, as there are no cliches in the script whatsoever (example: Instead of using 'Dead as the DoDo' a phrase like 'We're deader than A-line flares with pockets in the knees.' is used) ; Has had 8 excellent seasons with the first 6 available on DVD (and the next two coming in Novemeber and February) ; Talk of a movie in the pipeline, but no sign as yet.
