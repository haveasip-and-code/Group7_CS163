70's
The absolute best time in music to have existed, and, perhaps ever exist. With bands such as the Moody Blues (Nights in White Satin), America, Chicago (Dust in the Wind), Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zepplin, Marvin Gaye, Free, Blood Sweat and Tears, and all the awsome forms of disco, the 70's were just a time of absolute fantastic.
