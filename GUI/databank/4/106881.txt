Scooter Trash
Term for a chav/skally who turn 16 (sometimes) and steal a 'ped'. Always a 50cc 5 year old moped with stupid looking silver stripes and a pathetic looking/sounding 'racing exhaust' (yes because people race moped all the time huh?). Not to be confused with real motorcycle LEARNERS who will progress on to bigger and better bikes, these piss poor wannabes will soon be trading in their 'pimpin wheels' for a used metro to pose around in. ; Commonly seen with 2/3 chavs to one moped running from the police, safety equipment worn usually involves a t-shirt and the usual tracky bottoms for the boys, same for the girls but think jackets with furry collers add style points. ; Very occasionally a 50cc field bike can be used instead, but these have less room under the seat for white lightning and so are frowned upon by most in the scooter trash alternative. ; Scooter trash like to travel in groups when possible, forming a scene like that of the Adidas advert with the famous footballers riding around on Lambretta's at 20 mph. They can be found regularly posing on their 'ped' in town centres, surrounded by a large group of lesser skallies who have not yet found a ped to steal.
