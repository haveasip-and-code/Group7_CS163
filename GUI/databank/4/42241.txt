Chestnut Hill College
A VERY small high-school type 'college' with an extremely low caliber student body (average gpa 2.0) all on almost full scholarship.. NO student life.. Required: an ettiquette seminar for all students, dating lectures, etc. school run by overpaid nuns.. horrible facilities, HUGE cockroaches, low budget teachers, disgusting dorms, horrible sports teams. All students are similar in personality to the high school 'band kid'.. very depressing place..
