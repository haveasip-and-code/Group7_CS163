floater
A floater is a social mastermind who wavers between members of one particular clique or between multiple cliques in general, pitting people against one another and leeching out information without seeming like a threat. A perfected floater will appear incredibly trustworthy and neutral and will play both sides, but in reality, floaters look out for themselves and do whatever possible to keep themselves alive in any given scenario.
