slumming
Young-ish, wealthy parasites feeding off the lifestyles of the urban working classes in order to appear cool or hard. These hypocrites typically hang with their new poorer friends for a while, find out the daily grind isn't exactly what they had envisioned, get bored or scared or tired of having to actually work for once, and then return to their trust funds.
