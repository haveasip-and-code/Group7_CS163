Pocket Tanks
A game from Blitwise, where you choose 10 weapons, and then take turns trying to bomb each others' tanks by setting a weapon, power and angle. The Deluxe version comes with more weapons, and expansion packs for the Deluxe version are also available. The Basic version just has 30 weapons, but the Deluxe version has 60 weapons, 125 with all the expansion packs (There are seven expansion packs). The game was recently a fad in the schools of Delaware. For optimal gaming, turn off the in-game music, and put on either O-Zone's 'Dragostea Din Tei', Danzel's 'Pump It Up', Gwen Stefani's 'What You Waiting For' (my choice), or Underworld's 'Moaner'.
