golden goose
A legendary historic figure from Lakeville Minnesota, who wore a Gold Track suit and often urinated his pants. Became famous for having a diarrhea explosion in the middle of a sixth grade classroom. There was such an abundance of poop that it flowed out of the bottom of his pants and formed a puddle on the floor. And he was a giant douche too!
