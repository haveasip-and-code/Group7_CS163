intolerance
Usually used to describe a characteristic of someone who is to the right of you in the political spectrum or morally superior. When all other defenses of one's preference to have sex with other members of the same gender fails, trot out the 'intolerance' card. ; Nearly a capital offense to be in possession of such; i.e., tolerance of all other religeons, races, sexual proclivities, etc., is more important than any other characteristic one may possess. Note, however, than other religeons (notably Muslim) offer no such reciprocity and in fact, want to kill you because you are not like them.
