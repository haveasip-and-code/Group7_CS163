gulag
1. A Russian penal institute. Stands for 'G'lavnoe 'u'pravlenie ispravitel'no-trudovykh 'lag'erei (chief administration of corrective labor camps.) ; 2. Any mental institute in the USA. People get sent to those hellholes for expressing themselves, reporting abuse (or any wrongs done to them), writing poetry, speaking out against government policies, when their parents dislike them, and for various other HARMLESS 'violations' of the so-called 'social contract.' Essentially, these people are punished for things they MIGHT do, based on someone's 'artificial fear'. ; Inside the gulags of America, the 'artificial fear' cycle is perpetuated. People who are less threatening than a person in a wheelchair, are treated worse than violent felons. ; They are usually strapped down and jacked up with dangerous psychotropic drugs 24 hours a day, and they are given less rights than the most dangerous correctional institute inmates -- they are prevented from communicating with the outside world in ANY way, they are denied the right to an attorney or physician, and they are denied medical treatments for their injuries, cancer, and acute illnesses...... all in the name of $cientology. ; Patients even get MURDERED by the staff... and these staffers never see a day in jail, because all the murders are covered up.
