banter bomb
Noun. Colloquial. A nugget of chat so stinky that when it is dropped (usually by a [bantex] or [chob]) any bonhomie in the surrounding area is instantly blown away. If the banter bomb is particularly explosive only a [banter machine] will be able to prevent any joie de vivre being sucked ruthlessly away from those unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity. ; Origin: Men going on tours together and becoming morally reprehensible
