yo-yo g
A [ghetto] [wannabe] that uses slang terminology. Typically, they wear long white t-shirts, long jean shorts, air force ones, and baseball caps. They are everywhere and each one is the same as the next. They tend to put nice rims on their crappy cars and listen to the latest hip-hop song with bass turned up to an obnoxious level. They are some of the dumbest people on the planet with no successful futures in sight. Unfortunately, chicks tend to gravitate towards these retarded conformists.
