led zepplin
Actually spelled 'LED ZEPPELIN', but that's not a big deal. what is a big deal is the fuckhole that wrote this: ; If you don't know who they are...well you should follow a BLACK DOG up THE STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN only to be DAZED AND CONFUSED because you will never know THE SECRET OF EVERMORE ; the song is actually called BATTLE OF EVERMORE ; it's based on the lord of the rings series by tolkien, as a couple of LED ZEPPELIN'S songs are. ; this guy is obviously a retard and should not be taken seriously.
