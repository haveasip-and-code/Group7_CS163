il duce
Originally Mussolini's title for himself during World War II, meaning 'the chief' in Italian. (The second word is pronounced 'DOO-cheh'.) ; In modern slang, a particularly well-crafted [blunt]. This sense surely derives from the close similarity of the phrase to '[ill] [dutchy]. ; Sometimes, by extension, applied to a master craftsman of blunts.
