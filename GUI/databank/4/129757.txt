katamari
1. The name of the tool used by the Prince in the game Katamari Damacy--the ever expanding ball of monumental importance that will one day consume all the earth. Quite possibly, Revelations may have predicted the Katamari and the King of All Cosmos to be the instruments of the apocalypse. How disturbing. ; 2. Nomme de plumme applied to the drug ecstasy by fellow college compatriots who found the drug references of the game hilarious and somewhat less than subliminal ('Roll free and forever!').
