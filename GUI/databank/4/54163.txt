Seagull Boys
Boys that wear polos, rainbows, sperrys, and tucked in shirts. They are crazy for suzie seafarers, and are known to shout AHOY THERE when they are out and about on the sea. They are also know for their high tolerance of country music, and they love to shag to James Taylor, in the cage. They are also know for their ridiculously good looks, and magnificent sea skills.
