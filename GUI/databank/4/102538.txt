Otsego
Otsego is a city located in Michigan, a town in Minnesota, and a county in New York. Wayne Static of [Static-X] attended college near Otsego Michigan. He found the town so depressing that he named the song 'Otsegolation' after it. On every album after the first there is an Otsego song: Otsego Undead, Otsegolectric, and finally Otsego Amigo. The reason why three more Otsego songs were writen is unclear.
