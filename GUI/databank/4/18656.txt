Entinity coming in various types and with different specials each. Develops to [Woman] when approximately 18 years old. ; Evil (avoid! dangerous!): ; This form will push you into a [relationship] and then consume all your [time] and [money], force you to have [sex] with her and complain about your performance in general and your [skill] in bed in particular before either exchanging you with the next victim or stabbing you and then sell your internal organs.

Fun to be with. Won't force you to anything except for [conversation]. Relationships possible but often difficult because of the lack of [patience] on either side.
