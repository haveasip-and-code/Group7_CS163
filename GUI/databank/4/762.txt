fizzer
The 7-11 version of the morning after pill in which a young, promiscuous girl attempts to eliminate the possibility of pregnancy after a sex session sans protection by purchasing a bottle of soda, vigorously shaking said bottle, and then deftly inserting the bottle's opening into the vagina so as to create a soda geyser, meant to flush out any rogue sperm.
