McKevitt Spousal Exchange Program
McKevitt Trucking's dating service. Usually consisting ex-wives (or sometimes, husbands) of such truck drivers. There is a head 'John' working at the company. ; Since the company trucks are governed at granny speed, and the driver's don't have time to date anyone, it's no wonder there's such a service to these drivers that don't have time for lot lizards.
