boat drinks
From the Title & lyrics of the 1979 Jimmy Buffett song 'Boat Drinks'. Refers to highly potent (usually rum based) drinks which are easily made on a boat. The reference to someone ordering boat drinks means they are intent on getting very drunk. ; A later reference was in the 1995 movie 'Things to do in Denver when you're dead'.
