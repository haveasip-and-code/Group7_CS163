Jack Munchie
A very oftenly used insult used by the immature population. Other more adult versions of this are examples such as Jack Ass, or plainly Ass. 'Jack' is heard to be a old famous donkey from medevial times, and a munchie is that pesky little green man that is used in the old game by Macintosh called Super Munchers
