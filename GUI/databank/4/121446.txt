Tickle Time
'Tickle Time' is becoming a vastly popular activity in sixth form centres across the UK. Originating from the small village of Etwall on a hot summer's day, were by one man was tickled until he could not breathe. It was decided that this would become a daily occurence at 1 p.m every weekday, due to its sheer comic value. This purist approach is the most favourable but many revoultionaries have decided that in order for the victim to be tickled, they must first be defeated in a wrestling match. This new approach to 'Tickle Time' has made 1 o clock's across the country a very entertaining and social occasion.
