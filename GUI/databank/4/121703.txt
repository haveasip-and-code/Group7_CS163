Made in China
Low priced everyday goods from China. Generally associated with poor quality but is not true in many cases. If it weren't for 'Made in China' goods', you'd pay 50% more for everyday goods (because imported Chinese products are far cheaper than local products). Most 'Made in China' products are safe to buy, except for the ones in dodgy packing or without a use-by date.
