Patriot act
Dear retard above: ; Read the constitution. Ever see the part that says 'Freedom of Privacy'? How can you glorify a blatent defiance of our rights as American citizens? This kind of law has only existed in fascist countries, now stop being so fucking ignorant. By the way, many liberals HAVE read, or at least tried to read the patriot act. It has no definition of the word terrorist, either, meaning, yes, it allows the goverment to arrest any human being simply for their name without a proper trial.
