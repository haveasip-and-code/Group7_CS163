akata
A name from the Yoruba ethnic group in Nigeria for African-Americans. It is rumoured to mean 'slaves' or 'captives', and often carries a derogatory connotation. Some say that the literal definition is 'cotton picker' - The term was popularised in Hollywood by the movie Sugar Hill. ; This term has been picked up by Africans in the United States. Many Africans that pick up the word however are not aware that it is derogatory as they do not know the origins and do not know the yoruba language so depending on whos saying it, they may mean it as an insult. If the person is Nigerian, particualry of Yoruba origin, they may have a better understanding of why they are using that word.
