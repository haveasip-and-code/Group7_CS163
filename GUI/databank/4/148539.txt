Rolling Stone
A horrible corporate ad-fuck of a magazine that has reviewers who know almost nothing about music. While sometimes they will give high ratings to albums that are worthy, they are often afraid to give shitty pop and pop-punk (Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan etc...) anything under 2 or 3 stars. WTF is that?!?! Not to mention all the crappy rap that they have the nerve to call 'art' (not all rap is bad but you wouldn't know that from their reviews) They also take an MTV-esque whiny liberal stance in their politics section (I myself am a strong liberal but I find their articles extremely biased playing into Hollywood style 'limousine liberalism') ; In the end their just another glorifier (along with radio, the RIAA and MTV) of bad music in America. ; Do yourself a favor and support Indie artists and those with actual talent, not top 40 pop/pop-puck/emo/rap songs.
