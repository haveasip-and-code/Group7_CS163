leaver
Typically used in the custom Warcraft 3 game, [dota]. There are a few different types of leavers: ; 1. Assholes that join a DotA game just so they can leave when the game starts and annoy the piss out of everyone. ; 2. Assholes that play in DotA games and then leave when they are sucking badly. ; 3. Complete morons that join in a Dota game and leave the room before the host even starts.
