SAP
Spoiled American Princess-Typical american girl who thinks she should be worshipped and adored like a queen. Demands attention wherever she goes and pitches huge bitch-fits if she doesn't get her way right away. Can't accept competition of any sort or that other girls may have something that she doesn't. A product of poor baby boomer parenting.
