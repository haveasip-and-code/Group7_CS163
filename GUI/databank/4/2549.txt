self-fulfilling prophecy
A 'prophecy' in which you become something you are told. For example, if you're told you're ignorant, evil, and stupid, you will grow up to be that way because you believed it. ; Self-fulfilling prophecy is the reason that many blacks, NOT ALL but many, are criminals.....because of the way they brought themselves up. Self-fulfilling prophecies are especially quite common with Generation Y.
