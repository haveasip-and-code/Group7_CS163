Havre de Grace
1.The Decoy Capital of the World, and perhaps more than coincidentally, the Nick-Naming a City for the Most Obscure Inconsequential Bullshit Possible Capital of the world. A rather poor town in Maryland, a state in which any poverty is most likely a result of the place strangling itself with it's own high-ass standard of living.Anyone over the age of 40 living in Havre de Grace probably fucking hates it there. ; 2.A town filled with Antique shops run by antique people that hate those devilish industries that would bring that uh..what's it...ah, profit, to the town. ; 3. Seriously, get me the hell out of here.
