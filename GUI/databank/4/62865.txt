beat in the face
Horribly ugly, very unbecoming, usually a female. A woman looking as if she had been 'beat in the face'. Very sad looking usually, always ugly. Men usually signal their friends with the back of their hand striking their palm to signal that the chick they're talking to or about is 'beat in the face'
