ex-boyfriend
1. A BOY that dump's you because he would rather play with his [Star wars] action figures(even tho he is 28). ; 2. A BOY that dumped you because he wanted to dress up like a [Storm Trooper] and you didnt want to be around for that. ; 3. Someone who wanted to screw all of you friends cause you took his virginity and you just werent 'enough' (like he knew that the next chick would give him herpies). ; 4. Loser. ; 5. Waist of time/life/minutes I'll never get back. ; 6. is when you see him once every 6 weeks, and he swears you're the only girl he's ever loved and never cheated on, when really during those 6 weeks he's fu*kin every bitch that looks at him, and then lying to you telling you he is SLEEPING when he can't answer his phone, or it's off. Oh ya, and he also fu*ks the 'study buddy' from school, and the neighbor across the hall! Fu*kin Marines! Think they'er the shit!
