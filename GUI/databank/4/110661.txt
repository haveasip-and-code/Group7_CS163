carravancross
A sporting event derived from Truck Racing, a redneck race orgaiser got bored with trucks racing around a simple track all day and decided to mix things up a bit. At first he added a few dirt humps to the track, then the truck drivers changed to smaller models to counter the humps. Soon enough the big rigs were changed for Vauxhal Novas (Usually beat up chav style hatchbacks) and the trailers with Carravans, and Caravancross was born. ; Some tricks of Carravancross include the cross over, where the driver gets 'air' by hitting a ramp hard, while in the air the carravan is swung out and then moved back inwards again. Another popular move is the 360.
