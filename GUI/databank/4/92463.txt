Allrounder
In cricket a player who can play in more than one role to a good standard. The traditional allrounder is a batsman and a bowler (Eg. Ian Botham, Andrew Flintoff, Imran Khan, Sir Gary Sobers) but more recently a new breed of wicketkeeper-batsman allrounders have emerged with Adam Gilchrist of Australia leading the way.
