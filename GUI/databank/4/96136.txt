dirty bird
A touchdown celebration created by Jamal Anderson for the 1998 Atlanta Falcons. The dance, which consisted of flapping arms to act like wings, was introduced when tight end O.J. Santiago celebrated his two-touchdown effort following a 41-10 victory at New England in early November. The fever it generated captivated a national audience as well as brought the Falcons to the front of the Atlanta sports scene.
