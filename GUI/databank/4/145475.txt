training wheels
Little wheels that are installed in the back of bicycles, to the left and right, for kids who want to ride a bicycle but can't balance yet. With these wheels, they can ride without falling down. Eventually, they'll get rid of the training wheels when they get older, and they'll need to do that if they want to go faster and turn better.
