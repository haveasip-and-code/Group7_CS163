Halo nerd
One who plays Halo 2 online for hours on end in an attempt to improve their rank. These people generally suck at life so they hide away from the real world and talk shit to people over their mic to make them feel big because they know they cant get their ass kicked. and they regard everyone who doesnt waste their every waking hour playing halo as a 'n00b'. These people clearly take videogames way too seriously.
