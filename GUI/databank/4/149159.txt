dastardly
Strangely, 'bastardly' is not a word, but the same meaning is served by the term 'dastardly.' Once a serious insult, dastardly is now almost always used [sarcastic]ally. If used seriously, the speaker is most likely a [nancy boy] and/or [fop]. It is generally used in the phrase 'dastardly deed(s).'
