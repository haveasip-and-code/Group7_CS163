Polkaroo
1. Legendary costumed character from Canadian children's TV show, the 'Polka Dot Door'. Only spoken word was 'Polkaroo'. ; Always appeared when one of the two hosts of the show was not around... because the missing host was dressed as Polkaroo. ; 2. A clear sign of low budget Canadian public television (why couldn't they hire a third actor to play the part??)
