ExoSquad
An awesome early 90's cartoon series where humanity battles the Neosapiens, a genetically engineered slave spicies created by humanity. The battle between humanity and the neosapiens rages across the solar system. The name ExoSquad is derived from the powered armor that the humans and Neosapiens did battle in called Exo Frames. The series strikes me as being a futuristic verson of World War II, where Phaeton (the main neosapien) bears a striking resemblance to Hitler in behavior. (death camps, 'wonder weapons', he even had a fatal genetic disorder!)
