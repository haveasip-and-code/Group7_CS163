Starpoint
Located in Western New York east of Buffalo in Lockport, it is the worst education edifice ever established. The administration is a bunch of elitist, full of themself dickheads who have no idea how to properly run a school. 20 degree weather with blinding blizzards is no problem. The adminstration holds school anyway, and it indirectly caused the death of a well-liked senior in 2004. Most of its students are douchebags and, although it appears we are receiving a proper, future-building education, noone who graduates from Starpoint ever actually does anything important with their lives. Noone who goes to Starpoint ever wants to really do anything because the school sucks so much ass and just brings you down. The majority of the faculty consiste of inept, unqualified, lazy teachers. (Examples: Mrs. Solly, Mr. Franco, Mr. Moore) with a few exceptions such as Mr. Miller and Mr. Moran. All in all Starpoint is qualified as the worst school ever and people dread going there every day.
