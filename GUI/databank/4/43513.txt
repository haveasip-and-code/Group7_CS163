Baron of Hell
A lowly boss in the original [Doom] games by id games, the first Baron of Hell was not seen until the last level of the first episode of the first game. On this level, a shocking two Barons appeared, as well as an army of spectres (invisible demons that could bring down health levels fast). The Barons of Hell were enormous, could take more punishment than you could dish out, and fired extremely powerful green magical attacks with 100% accuracy. Fortunately, these energy blasts were slow and easy to avoid, and it's the only kind of attack the Barons knew. Later in the game, they became common enemies, attacking along with entire armies of monsters all at once.
