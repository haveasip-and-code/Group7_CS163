PPS
Public Piss Syndrome ; When you have PPS you are prone to losing your desire to urinate when someone else is in the room. Often someone being in the stall next to you creates this problem. Urinals will become your worst enemy when you are affected by PPS, as large urges to urinate can be abolished even by the opening of the bathroom door.
