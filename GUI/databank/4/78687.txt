A Spogangster or Spokangster is a person between ages 10 and 27 found in the city of Spokane. They typically wear crappy JNCO's, South Pole clothes, and the occasional Aeropostale and BOSS Wear hoodie. Also thinks U.S. Polo Association is a designer Ralph Lauren brand. Fake bling piercings are da bomb for them. The girls typically shop at Rave, Deb and other crappy girl's stores with 'baby girl' shirts in them. They have no sense of fashion other than MTV rap videos, so they ultimately love their male counterpart Spogangsters, thinnking they are the rappers on MTV. Worships J-Lo and Lil' Jon. Guys have to be blonde, skinny and have shaved heads. Facial hair is highly encouraged to cover their white skin, so as to appear more Black. Ultimately failing. They typically hang out at Northtown Mall or walking up and down Division Street.
