Sacramento
The capital of California, also known as Suckramento.Contrary to popular belief, Sacramento is NOT a cowtown, Sacramento County is mostly urban-suburban, but make no mistake, it is DEFINITELY NOT exciting here either. After 10pm, there is absolutely nothing to do, unless you enjoy getting drunk (like everywhere, bars are open until 2am), or going to the 24-hour WalMart, or smoking crank.
