Poop Butt
Poop butt describes someone who tries to be cool but has some serious flaws showing that they are a square except that they don't seem to know it. Or a generally cool but sloppy disgusting person. Nothing is wrong with being a square but you should just be who you are. The Poop Butt's gestures and manner of dressing will most often tell that he isin't who you say you are. If you have a ketchup stain on your shirt while getting ready at home but you still decide to wear it to the school dance is Poop Butt-esque. To have some shoes that smell BAD and it was noticed in an awkward social situation that people will remember. When you are trying to date a hard-to-get very attractive woman and you try to woo her with your 1996 Toyota Camry, your job at wal mart with benefits and you were caught digging in your nose right out front of her office. That is the folly of a Poop Butt. Wearing new gymshoes but they have a big blop of chilli on the laces and you wear them as if none of the ladies at the local hangout you hope to score with are not going to notice or you sloppily wipe it off making a greasy mess across the top of your shoe. Lazy and sloppy people who ignore certain hygeine or social protocol but not in a small way. They do it as large as day and don't know that they look stupid. Or it could be a person who through sloppiness in mind and/or action shows that he is not cool or tough and always tells more about himself than people want to know.
