Nati Dime
when you mix Dimetapp with any kind of alcoholic beverage but mostly just vodka or cheap bear. It will make the beer and vodka taste like grape juice. This will cause confusion, dizziness and drowsiness but is much safer then using codeine or promethazine, considering you can buy Dimetapp over the counter. Originated in Cincinnati.
