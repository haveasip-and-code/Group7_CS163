dweb
Combination of 'web' and 'dweeb'. Individual who spends the majority of their waking hours on the internet. In particular, they indulge in posting links to deliberately disgusting or obscene websites throughout forums, and/or seek 'hook-ups' in chatrooms. ; (Hopefully someone else or myself could come up with a better synonym in the future.)
