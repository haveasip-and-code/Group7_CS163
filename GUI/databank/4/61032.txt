Maple Story
MapleStory is a really Asian-ish, 2D game that has no creativity, since the monsters are so repetitive (ex, there's Spore for beginners, then like a Undead Spore, and a Large Spore, and a bunch of other spores) basically, think [Ragnarok Online] minus the coolness. But it's easy to get addicted anyway. :D
