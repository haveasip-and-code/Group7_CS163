Wind Waker
Reference to the game, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. ; It was an attempt by Nintendo to return to the original style of the Zelda games, such as that featured in A Link to the Past, Link's Awakening, and all the other 2D Zelda games (except for, possibly, The Adventure of Link). ; Through cel-shading, Miyamoto attempted to create a fascinating, beautiful new world, and succeeded for the most part, even though many will agree that the ocean replacement for the world map was lazy. ; Unfortunately, there is a lot of controversy going around with this game; many say the graphics are too kiddy and that the series should go back to the Ocarina of Time stylings. ; Note that this game reinforced the 'kiddy' label that is frequently pushed onto Nintendo, now practically tattooed on. ; Most that have played it will agree, weather they like the graphical style or not, that it's a good game.
