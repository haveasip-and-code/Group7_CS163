V Sign
1)Something Asians put up when they have their pictures taken. ; May stem from Winston Churchill flashing the Victory sign after WWII. ; In Japan the sign may have also become popular because of the post-WWII Allied occupation of Japan. Janet Lynn may have popularized its use in amature photographs when in the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo she fell, but still continued with a smile. Afterwards she flashed the V sign and the Japanese media eat it up. ; 2)A hand gesture in which the first and second fingers are raised and parted, whilst the remaining fingers are clenched. Generally considered a 'Victory' sign, it can also carry connotations of 'Peace' and 'Defiance'
