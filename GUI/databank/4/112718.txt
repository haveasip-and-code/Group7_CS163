Nobutyeahbutnobut
Nobutyeahbutnobut and its variants (yeahbutnobut, nobutyeahbut, yeah, but, no, but, yeah, but, and many more) is used as an un-understandable reply to something serious to make it seem as unimportant. It sometimes follows a rapid slur of mixedwordswhicharealsounrealatedto the point being made. It originated from a show called Little Britain, which way better than the office.
