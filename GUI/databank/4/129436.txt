pseudoscene
A pseudoscene person happens to be someone who dearly wishes that he or she could fit into the description which is that of a [scenester]. But while said person wishes that they could be [scene], he or she seems to fail miserably and becomes a disgrace to him or herself and the people around him or herself. Most pseudoscenesters are characterized by 'really cool' black and bleached blonde hair, tight Diesel or Seven jeans for both the guys and girls, black Converse All Stars, favorite band tote bag, something along the lines of a Pretty Girls Make Graves shirt, various facial piercings (optional), heavy eye makeup, etc. These people just seem to think that they are 'really cool' becuase they are so '[scene]' when, in all actuality, they are frowned upon by the numerous musical cliques of the world.
