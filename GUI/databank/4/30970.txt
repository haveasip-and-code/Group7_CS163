German Trance
A sub-genre of hard trance, most producers of which are from Germany characterised by dark and brooding melodies, pulsating basslines, and really messed up vocal samples that you would never want your grandmother to hear. Does not refer to only trance from Germany and as such Dark Trance would be a better name.
