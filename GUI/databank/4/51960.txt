caps
A drinking game. Two people sit across from each other, legs extended, touching feet. Your drink sits right about in your croch, with the bottle cap upside down on top of the neck. The purpose it to knock the cap off of the other persons bottle, and when you do, they have to take a drink. For every miss, the next player throws. For every sucessful throw, that player throws again.
