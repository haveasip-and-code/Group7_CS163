A sub-genre of the sub-culture knowen as punk rock and is generally accosiated with the act of wearing creepers, button up shirts, choppy styled hair with a blonde splosh spot in ones hair. Also showering 15 times a day and being a cocky bastard to anyone who can't afford those 70 dollar desinger stretch jeans they bought.
