shoe ball
A game created at Oak Ave. It envolves 3-infinite(the more the better) players. It's basically tackle football without the rules. The players have one person 'donate' their shoe for the session; the donator throws it up into the air; whoever catches it runs like hell; he gets tackled (and that's that). Althought there are some rules that are followed (IE no biting, hair-pulling) it's mostly [anything goes]. There are exceptional rules that apply to people with glasses, but they are optional.
