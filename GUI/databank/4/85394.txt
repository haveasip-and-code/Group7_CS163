mexican
A person skilled in the art of jumping fences, screaming meaningless gibberish, and be able to do intense labor for minimal wage. Considered extremely useful by many, Mexicans can work double the hours a white person can, recieve half the pay and go home to his family screaming '[Tequila]!, Tequila' and be content. However Americans are getting pissed because apparently the smell is finally getting to them- oh yeah and they take jobs from lazy Americans. Usually seen with a lawnmower, a mexicans one true weakness is the border patrol or illegal [immigration] services.
