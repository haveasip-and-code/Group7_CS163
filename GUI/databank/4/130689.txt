friglet
The offspring of a pig and a frog... basically the child of Kermit and Miss Piggy. ; Also known as a 'frig' or a 'pog'. ; The friglet is a delicacy amongst the French (even though they'll basically eat anything) yet is hard to catch: although it's grunts can be heard for miles, the little critter can jump 27 feet at a time, therefore anyone who's ever caught one is often referred to as being 'a lucky frigger'.
