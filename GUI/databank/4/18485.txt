tellitubbies
n. incredibly disturbing children's tv show featuring four possibly alien creatures with symbols on their heads. the one with the triangle on it's head is possibly a homosexual according to rumor / conspiracy theory. probably makes incredible sense if viewed while in a state of altered consciousness, a collapsed or damaged psyche, alcohol poisoning, or all of the above. aimed at children below the age of 5, probably because anyone viewing the show above that age for more than five minutes cannot be expected to survive.
