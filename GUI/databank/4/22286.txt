Obsqualla
No true meaning. Just a odd, and funny word said in an act of true randomness. Can be used to greet somone instead of saying hello, or can be pointlessly said to break the ice in an awkward conversation. ; This word was made up at [Camp Anytown] by several teenagers from Santa Teresa High School in a conversation group.
