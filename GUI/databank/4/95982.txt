free republic
Very conservative website, stopping just left of sites like stormfront. In many cases they are actually like stormfront, although their mindless hatred is directed toward Islam, rather than Judaism. The population of 'freepers' is predominantly white male, with some (white) women scattered in. The ignorant among them believe that America is totally desegregated, while the others believe it is the fault of the minorities for not acting 'empowered.' How do you know whether you belong at freerepublic.com? Simple... you are a freeper if *ALL* of the following apply to you: ; 1. You're white. ; 2. You're anti-Islam. ; 3. You believe gays aren't human beings and are living in sin. ; 4. You frequently use the terms LIEberal and demonRAT. ; 5. You're right of President Bush on the political spectrum in every aspect. ; 6. Throwing true conservatism to hell, you support the war in Iraq. ; 7. You can't hear the word 'Clinton' without frothing from the mouth. ; 8. You insult John McCain, arguably the sanest Republican in Washington D.C., for supporting a ban on torture. I suppose you're right, he's totally unqualified to discuss torture. I don't think I could name a person who has less right to support the ban than him. ; If you think my post is unfair or that I am biased, just read any of the threads, particularly ones involving race/Islam. ; The comments should tell you everything you need to know about the site.
