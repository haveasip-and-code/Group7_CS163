allot
A word improperly used by many. As no one wants to recognize that 'alot' is a valid word (see David Horvitz definition in Urban Dictionary), most spell-checkers propose to change 'alot' to 'allot'. Unknowingly users just accept the choice. ; Next time your spell checker tells you 'alot' is not correct, please 'add' it to your dictionary.
