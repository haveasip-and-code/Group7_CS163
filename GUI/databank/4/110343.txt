quasar
A quasar (more recently known as a QSO, Quasi-Stellar Object) is a distant star-sized energy source in space that gives off lots of ultraviolet. They are compact and very far away, but they are also very bright.Some of these QSO's gives off large amounts of radiation, including radio waves and X-rays. The word quasar is short for quasi-stellar radio objects. Quasars were first detected by Maartin Schmidt and Allan R. Sandage in 1963 -1964.
