Convergmas
Convergmas is unwillingly celebrated by thousands of [Convergys] employees each year on December 25th. Instead of opening presents and enjoying time with their family, many Convergys employees celebrate their bastardized version of Christmas answering phones, crying in the bathroom, and getting [wallaced].
