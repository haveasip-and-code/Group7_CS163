meriel
A girl who has no values and talks really loud to make it seem like she has sense. She thinks she can dance and sing and take over the world with her stupidity. People (her friends primarily) are blinded by her crap and consider her beautiful when all they wanna do is hit it and split. She's also the popular chick that has outrageous house parties just because she can. Her brain is tinier than the one of an ant and then wants to get loud with people when they are trying to prove her incorrect. She also thinks that she is in a way funny. When she acts like a fool, she thinks people will laugh with her and have a good time while all they are doing are laughing at her. She walks around with her 'friends' and thinks everyone likes her. This is when people smile sweetly and then in a split second turns around and talks about her. She has the ability to be good at some things but she doesn't have it in her to make something of herself. Eventually a meriel would realize that her life needs a turn around but that's when it's almost too late. Some make it but others usually sucumb to having multiple children which she acquired from 'good times' and living a very hard life. Some are lucky enough to have idiots pay for their every expense but in general, this women/girl live's a sad miserable little life like it's not a problem to herself or anyone else. She may have come from a broken home but just chose the wrong path and cannot be taught otherwise.
