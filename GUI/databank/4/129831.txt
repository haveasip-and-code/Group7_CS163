My Chemical Romance Fans
Really poser kids who think they can take over the world, claiming that Gerard Way is their god and so on. Now, let's of course, make clear that these kids only got to know of the band because Mtv completely commercialized Helena and now they dress in black and red because they're such goth-punk-rockers. These kids also claim that their kids will beat up other kids and that Frank Iero is one of the sexiest men alive. ; It would be relevant to add that most of these kids listen to Simple Plan, Good Charlotte and Avril Lavigne and thus, deserve death. ; Btw, I have nothing against the <i>real fans</i>, just that these ones suck major donkey cock.
