wazemed
'wazemed' is the new wrecked which was the new rolled which was the new burned- in other words, it is said when somebody loses status in front of their peers. It is generally accompanied by a hand gesture- the fist is displayed, the thumb and small finger are stuck out, and the fist is shook at the person for whom the 'wazemed' was intended.
