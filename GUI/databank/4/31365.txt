patch day
The day that shines with human error. Happens when MMORPGs get updated or 'fixed' with a patch, and madness breaks out on the forums about 'Omg I cant log in!' or 'Fix teh game or im not paying no more!!' Then they try to blame it on the players that they are doing something wrong. ; Usually lasts until the start of the next day.
