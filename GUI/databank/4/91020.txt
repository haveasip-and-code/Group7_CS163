gout
n. a form of arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals (due to hyperuricemia) in joints. It is an immensely painful disease, which in most cases affects only one joint, most commonly the big toe. The patient usually suffers from two sources of pain. The crystals inside the joint cause immense pain whenever the affected area is moved. The inflammation of the tissues around the joint also causes the skin to be swollen, tender and sore.
