azkar
Also known as the 'talking police car', Azkars can be found in the wild around Pittsburgh and are rarely used as pets. Known mainly for their love of poker, bowling, juggling, and Flogging Molly, their long treks to nearby stores for 2-liter Mountain Dew bottles, and formerly for their commanding skill, their distinguishing features include freckles, red hair, and pale skin. Should you encounter one, it is best to bribe it or trick it into licking its elbow, which will distract it long enough for you to beat a speedy retreat.
