Delmarva Peninsula
The Delmarva Peninsula, just called DelMarVa to most, is an area of the mid-atlantic region consisting of the lower two-thirds of DELaware, the Eastern shore of MARyland, and um, that strip of land from VirginiA. surrounded by the chesapeake bay and the delaware bay on three sides. major 'cities' include dover, salisbury, and Ocean City. the beaches are less crowded than in VA Beach, but the area has fallen victim to [urban sprawl] and somewhat bad traffic during the summer and back to school sales with the no-tax shopping in Delaware, or whenever the races come to town, or whenever the National Punkin Chunkin' takes place (don't ask). it's kinda hard to notice unless you look at a map and see how part of Maryland and Delaware and Virginia stick out from the rest of the surrounding states. delmarva is a cool little region that the natives tend to appreciate.
