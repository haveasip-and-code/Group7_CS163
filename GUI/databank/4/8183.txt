fagabeefy
In the movie Midnight Madness there was a group of Jock's, Nerds, Tuff guys ; and Cheerleaders. While in a van riding around, the bunch were putting letters together to de-code a secret-message to reveal the next place they had to be. The guy in the back of the van put the letters together that spelled out the word FAGABEEFY. Then he said it out load - 'Fagabeefy?'... and it was good.
