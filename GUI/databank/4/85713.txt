internet famous
Two sets: ; 1.(derogatory) A person who has become known for/through various internet related activites (e.g. chat rooms, IM, newsgroup posts etc) and is considered by others to be a looser yet considers themsleves and their conduct to be cool and thinks that they are apperciated by the group. A more accurate way to put it would be internet INfamous, but part of the charm is that it is a snide label to have put on you and sarcasm is found in its use. Akin to the the guy who is 'a legend in his own mind', he thinks he is hot but others see him as a huge fool. ; 2.To be known for being exposed (by self or by anothers posting)in sexually orientated pics or vids spread using the internet.
