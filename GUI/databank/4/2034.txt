from autumn to ashes
A hardcore/emo band that has a wonderful CD 'too bad you're beautiful.' It is too bad that they have a drummer that sings like a bitch and ruins the songs and the whole 2nd album entitled 'The Fiction we Live.' Also a band that could be simply amazing if they cut out the drummers vocal chords.
