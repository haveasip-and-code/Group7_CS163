0-90
Very unique bowling style used by only the best cricketers (or tallest). It is where u can bowl up to 90 mph in a two step run up. Originated in Wallington by cricketer Krishan Patel. Many have tried to replicate but have failed. Can only be done by the elite like Krishan, Obuya, Odumbe, tikolo.
