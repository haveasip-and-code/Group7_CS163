education
1) Something that parental and governmental fuck-tards would like you to believe holds up the world and fills it with rainbows and sunshine, but in fact just fills your mind with crap and your limited time on Earth with compulsory busywork. Straight-edged brainwash victims in AP classes also want you to buy this shit. ; 2) These twatfaces will argue that people rebelling against such an oppressive way of life must be really stupid. These are usually the same scumbuckets who can't appreciate good music and spit upon everything that it stands for. What's that? Why, it's the stench of hypocrisy.
