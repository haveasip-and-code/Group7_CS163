ctfo
CTFO is an acronym for Chill The Fuck Out. It was popularized as an everyday term by a Washington DC resident named Bryce, who attends the Maret School. Others may try to take credit, but Bryce actually did invent and popularize this phrase, after the surge in popularity of [WTF]. You are supposed to pronounce every letter in the word (ex: see tee ef oh)
