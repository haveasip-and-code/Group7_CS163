Yum
Yellow Dog Updater, Modified ; Yum is a great [CLI] application, with [GUI] front ends, similar to [Apt] for [RPM]s that makes updating, getting information about, installing and removing RPMs easy. It's used by Yellow Dog, [Fedora Core], and [RHEL] (and possibly more [distro]s I do not know about). When you install something via Yum, Yum automatically downloads and installs all dependencies of the package you want if you don't have the dependencies, putting an end to [dependency hell] if the package you want is in your Yum repositories. ; A great Yum configuration file for the most recent stable Fedora Core that adds great repositories can be found at http://www.fedorafaq.org/samples/yum.conf
