Palmerston
A city located in Australia, Northern Territory, just outside of Darwin. While many people are forced to live in Palmerston due to sky rocketing housing prices in Darwin, Palmerston in it's own right is a breeding ground for [white trash] and has become known as the [ghetto] of the Northern Territory. In Palmerston it is advised that you take some form of armament to defend your self from drunken [Itinerants] and car jackings as Palmerston has the highest rate of crime in all of Australia combined. Also home to many rev heads and V8 [bogan]s.
