Dead Genius Award
Fictional award bestowed upon individuals whose genius has become exaggerated as a result of their untimely death, usually before the age of 30. The award is usually presented by individuals who realise that music fans, the music industry and media often get carried away, mistakenly believing that any musician who dies young was a genius. Those bestowing the imaginary award are also able to entertain the idea that a musician who died young might have gotten fat, old or made a crap album. There is no official ceremony for the award as it is fictional and is often allocated during pointless conversations between friends. Many a Dead Genius Award is awarded each year with no official committee to decide who most deserves the award. This is mainly out of respect for the friends and family of the dead. ; Candidates for the award include [Tupac Shakur], [Kurt Cobain] and [Jeff Buckley].
