troll
Person who accesses internet forums with the expressed purposes of stirring up trouble or deliberately post contraversial material adverse to the general feeling of the majority of posters, or more often to be just plain fucking annoying and offensive. This is usually a result of an insane egotistical complexity that they cannot resolve in normal life, just plain old fashion attention seeking.
