Chip
(noun) Pejorative term describing [computer]s, stemming from resentment of their presence, usually perceived by the term's user as ubiquitous. ; Entymology: Coined 2004, arises from ideology that 'even though they don't make mistakes of their own, that don't mean sometimes they ain't a mistake to begin with.' A 'computer chip' is characteristic of most if not all modern computers, and is believed to be the root of this term.
