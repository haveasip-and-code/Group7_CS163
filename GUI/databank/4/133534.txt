Fair Lawn
A smallish town located in [Bergen County] New Jersey. Where there are more temples than houses. Home of the Fair Lawn Cutters, who haven't won a football game since 1703..B.C. Though most might mistake it as a golf course at times,no, our grass is not that nice. And where everyone knows if Martin Luther King and Christopher Colombus were Jewish, we might actually have those holidays off. A place where orange is not only a color, but a skin tone as well. Lets not forget, where you can hang out in the parking lot of CVS and be cool.
