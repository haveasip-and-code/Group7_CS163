gayte
verb. To date an obviously gay man before he has excepted his sexuality, while being aware (or at least highly suspicious) of his real preferences, in order to benefit from having a sensitive, well-dressed boyfriend who treats you right and is good in bed. More specifically, to be the last woman to date a gay man before he comes out of the closet.
