crackpr0n
Contraversial moderator at [Megatokyo] who promotes narrow-minded zealotry, and ethnocentricity. Has an array of personality problems e.g. Boasted on line that he had threatened his ex-girlfriend that he would beat up any guy she was dating if she did so before he thought she was ready. Often vassilates between being abusive then trying to avoid responsibility by claiming that people shouldn't care about what he says. Excessively dogmatic and extreme low tollerance when his opinions require rational support.
