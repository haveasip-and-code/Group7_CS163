star wars galaxies
An MMORPG based on the Star Wars franchise that would be really fun if it no longer contained noobs that want to become bounty hunters and/or jedis in one week. The community is in depth, and you can have fun doing pretty much anything, until you get good at it, then it begins to blow hard.
