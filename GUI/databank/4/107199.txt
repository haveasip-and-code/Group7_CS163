Silverbug
Mechanical insect like robot. Round body and about the size of a softball, with 4 legs. Each leg has three segments about 8 inches long. The end segments actually split into two pieces making 8 segments. These help the Silverbug travel effortlessly through deep caverns, along the floor, or on walls and ceilings. Made mostly of Platinum, these robots are found deep within the Wah Wah mountains. They are also described in detail, in the Podcast novel Earthcore by Scott Sigler.
