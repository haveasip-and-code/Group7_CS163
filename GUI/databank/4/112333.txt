community advisor
Also referred to as a 'CA' or 'RA' (residence advisor). The CA's are carefully selected students who are helpful and knowledgeable about areas of concern to students. CA's assist residents with both personal and Residence Hall living problems. Some are quite cool while others are downright pricks/bitches.
