global warming
A naturally-occuring change in the environment in which the global tempatures rise. Falsely presented as an exclusively man-made phenomenon in an attempt to demonize America, and its lifestyle. Said representation is a pathetic, politically-motivated hoax pushed by tree-hugging, tofu-eating, anti-civilization hippies who base scientific theories on emotion, and not fact.
