nelly
St. Louis rapper. Produced gems such as Country Grammar, Nellyville, Sweat and Suit. Just like any other artist, he has pop songs, he has thoughtful songs, and he has tough songs. I was at first disappointed at Sweat/Suit, but I found good stuff in 'N Dey Say' (which samples Spandau Ballet's 'True', nothing less) and 'My Place' (using some old Teddy Pendergrass song). No, he's not gay, I don't know where all you iconoclasts got that. He may not be God on earth, he may have a beef with KRS-ONE (whom I respect and who should pick his battles more carefully), he may not be the most original, best, what have you, but he's not an outright fraud like the recent influx of pointless Southern rap garbagemen. He went from a strict thug to a sophisticated (not in function, but in form) rhymesayer. Him wearing a bandaid is what every idiot criticizes him for, unaware that their favorite pop bands can equally be criticized for their own superficial details. Only Nelly's bandaid isn't exactly superfluous, you clueless morons. In conclusion, he's severely underrated by elitists and people entirely irrelevant in their criticism of him, severely overrated by tasteless mainstream consumers, and taken for his true worth by people with a mind not clogged with useless garbage.
