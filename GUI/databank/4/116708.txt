Wyomissing
A Town on the East Coast that is extremely close to Philadelphia. Many of the kids who go there are excessivally good looking, have rich parents, and own everything they want. You do not exsist if you do not consistantly wear ralph lauren, lilly pulitzer or lacoste polos, and if you do not use the correct launguage while interacting, then nothing will make sense to the people you are talking to. (Language consists of the phrases 'mad' 'chill' and 'straight'. Often kids will be sent off to boarding school due to bad behavior, and then kicked out since boarding school suplys more drugs than a rich wyo kid can ask for. During the summer if you do not sail or travel around the world then you most likely belong to a rich summer club (or green valley) that has either golf or tennis. Depending on who you involve yourself with, you could get nice friends, or friends who will always be your enemies. (also, parties are off the hook)The most popular sport is water polo and lacrosse (mainly for boys) and most all the water polo boys are exremely gorgeous and are excessive stoners.
