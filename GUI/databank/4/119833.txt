Hung like a Konnoh
This phrase...once thought to be part of a long dead language lost to humanity came into usage around the 10th of August 2005 after several college students made a startling discovering at a house party...The 'Konnoh' in question is as advertised...'[Hung]'...and as witnessed by a farely startled few students this 'Konnoh' roamed the houses grounds displaying his [manhood] to whom ever had the eye capacity to percieve it in all its glory...quotes from various sources circled the party like a game of chinese whispers...'like an arm holding an apple' was one of many examples...so to some up...being 'Hung like a Konnoh' is to be endowed with very large penis...
