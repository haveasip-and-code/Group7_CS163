Emo
It starts with stars, beyond the skies, beyond the heavens, beyond our reach, but we wonder, we try, we reach out and grab. ; I am a star. I am a shining star, and I am beyond your reach. ; And no matter how many ships you build you will never reach me. I exist among you, I speak to you, (I keep quiet). ; I don't need words, I don't need sound. You see it, you see it when you look at me, I'm different. ; I'm a giant. I can't be missed. You see me, and you want to know, what I am, what it's like, to be me to exist like i do and it's painful and it hurts and it's wonderful and it's chaotic and tiring. And it's not whining, it's not, it's not, it just hurts, and it needs to be expressed, you need to hear it, and it's not whining because it's true. ; I bleed, I cry, and die for you, I defecate my pain for you but you'll never know, because you are you and I am me and I am cursed and in love with you, and with myself, and with everyone and with Earth and nature and my pain and my struggling-struggling- to breathe, to think, to be understood and accepted, (do I want that?) ; Is that possible, not just for me, but for everyone, they're all irrelevent, you are irrelevent. Do you understand? You mean nothing to me, nothing, you are the pain I defficate, I need your acceptance. Please love me. ; Love me, love me and be gone, go, go away I don't have time for you, there's no time, no time, I have a lifetime to figure all this out, but just one life, that's it just one. ; And it'll end- it'll end with the stars, and I'll be one of them, a giant, and you'll look to me with your telescope, shining beyond the sky, but you'll never reach me. ; I'm a star, I'm untouchable, I'm special, different, I'm superior and inferior, important and useless, I'm in my head I'm in your way and you will look at me and you will reach out and you'll see that I'm a ghost, I'm a mirage, a dream, I'm everything you think and feel and want and love and hate. ; I'm emo.
