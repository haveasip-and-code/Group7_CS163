crack
Otherwise known as crack-cocaine, this illegal drug is a mixture of two parts cocaine and one part baking soda. This chemical process reverts the powder-cocaine mkaing process by one step, producing a smokable form of the naturally found alkaloid cocaine. Because of its nature as an inhalable substance, the high is quicker and more intense, leading to a larger number of addicts. In present society, it is considered to be much more distasteful to use crack-cocaine then powder-cocaine as crack is mainly viewed as a drug for poor people whereas powder cocaine is used by a richer constituancy. Contrary to popular belief, crack-cocaine is not freebase cocaine. Freebase cocaine is a mixture of cocaine, ether, and other dangerous and combustable materials. Baking soda was replaced as the ingredient in the 1980's to make production easier and less dangerous. Either way, crack and freebase cocaine produce the same smokable form of the drug.
