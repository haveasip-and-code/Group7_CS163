wa lau
chinese dialect, meaning shucks, or something u say when u r pissed off. usually used at the beginning of a sentence. ; used commonly by teenagers ( well, mostly those who dont give a damn to the 'speak good english' campaign ) in singapore and malaysians. ; sometimes ppl use 'wapiang' instead. 'wa lau' sounds more crude.
