john major
Prime Minister of UK 1990 - 97. Politically a failure really. His achievements include: ; - in 1992 he totally fucked the economy with the the ERM debacle; ; - 1993 - 1997 he sort of stabilised the economy but no-one forgave him when it came to the next elextion; ; - He had two schemes to try and take people's mind off what happened in 1992. The first was the so-called 'Back to Basics' slogan, which led to every Tory who had ever had an affair being publically humiliated. ; - The second idea was the Northern Ireland Peace Process, which involved releasing loads of IRA terrorists from jail, in return for which the IRA has not yet decommissioned one single firearm. ; - On the plus side, he invented the National Lottery, and timed important international summit meetings to coincide with major rugby and cricket matches.
