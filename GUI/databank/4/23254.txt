ecstasy
Ecstasy was supposedly patented in 1913 by some German chemical company to be sold as an appetite suppressant, but they decided against marketing the diet pill and had nothing to do with it. It was banned federally in 1985. ; I've tried just about every drug out there and XTC is the only drug I actually enjoyed. it lasts anywhere from 3-6 hours. It gives the most intense feeling that is hard to describe; half hour after you take the pill there's a intense rush-like feeling followed by a sense of pure pleasure/bliss, it produces positive feelings, empathy for others, elimination of anxiety, and extreme relaxation. Of course it does include crappy stuff such as involuntary teeth clenching (which is why most ravers suck on those pacifiers)and give you that bug eyed look. ; Becareful though if you can't handle your drugs (like me at times) I do not recommend doing E, it can make you do and say things you will be ashamed of after the high is gone, plus the comedown can be huge a bitch. Not to mention the long-term effects that can leave you at risk of developing permanent brain damage that may manifest itself in depression, anxiety, memory loss, and other neuropsychotic disorders (some of which I may actually have now)
