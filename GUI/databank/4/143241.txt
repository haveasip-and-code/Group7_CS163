A national restaurant set in the 50's. Jukeboxs are at every table, and the bar, where you can choose a selection of 50's and 60's songs that will eventually play. They have the best milkshakes ever, and serve tons of amazingly delicious greasy food. The waiters/waitresses and cooks also dress in 50's attire. Old Coca-Cola ads also adorn the walls.
