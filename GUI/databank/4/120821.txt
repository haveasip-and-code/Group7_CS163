Dyke Jones
A.K.A Mike Jones ; The term Dyke Jones was popularized by you could say 'Rival' ex swisha house Chamillionaire. Used on Mixtape Messiah to rap back, and sure as hell ' served ' his ass up. ; A 'down south' rapper, who's lyrics are child play. He repeats his lyrics, and his name over and over. He thinks hes running the game, but truly hes a fake bastard.
