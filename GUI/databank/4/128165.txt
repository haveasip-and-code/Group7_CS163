Polka Hardcore
A very intense form of music and/or dance created by The Corsetts [they own/rock/will kick your ass if you're not cool and still try to master Polka Hardcore]. Polka Hardcore is only for hardcore kids, not teeny boppers, posers, gangstas, scene/emo kids or pot heads/coke fiends. Polka Hardcore requires massive amounts of training [sometimes 20 hours a day] and heavy cash donations to the creators [The Corsetts] or else they'll own you. Ninjas are naturally Polka Hardcore masters.
