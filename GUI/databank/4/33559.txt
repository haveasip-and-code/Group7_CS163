Tight Rules
Meaningless phrase that sounds hip enough for nobody to question it. This enables you to sound like you have your finger on the urban pulse when in reality you sit in your country house all day playing classical music and looking at your monkey puzzle tree. Can be used as a response to pretty much any statement, depending on it's infliction.
