Current 3-series that came to US first as `06 models. So far the 325i and 330i sedan are offered. Coupes will follow soon as well as the wagon. A V8 M3 should be out as an `07 or `08 model. Engines changes are already underway, looking for a turbo 6 cylinder that will be called the 335i, replacing the 330i and the 325i will be turned into the 328i, even though they will all be 3.0 liters.
