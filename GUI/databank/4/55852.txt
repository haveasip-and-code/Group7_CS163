jibbing
Normally a term in secondary schools in England seeing as most of the other definitions are nothing like what it means in school. It is the act of skipping lessons by hiding out somewhere usually in the school grounds. Most [Jibbers] usually are in groups of two to five. Jibbers are by no means bad kids, a lot of people jib the lessons they hate. Also if someone is off school for whatever reason then it is almost a necessity to say 'jibbing' when that person's name is called in the register, just to annoy the teacher.
