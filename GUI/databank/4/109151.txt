Colonie
A town on the north edge of Albany, New York, which includes Latham. Take Northway exits 2-6 to get there, or take Rt. 9 between Albany and Saratoga County. It borders Albany, Crescent, Watervliet, Loudonville, and all of America via the Albany International (not) Airport off exit 4. ; South Colonie kids think there's a big rivalry between them and the north (Latham/ Shaker High) but the north is so far ahead of them they don't even notice the south, as they are too busy fighting Shenendehowa High in Clifton Park. It features Colonie Center Mall, which is a really good mall but can't compare to the nearby Crossgates in Albany. Latham Circle Mall is dying but their cinema has really comfortable seats. ; Colonie also features a lot of good book stores. There is a Borders and a Barnes and Nobles right around the Colonie Center Mall (which has a Waldenbooks, which is also at Latham Circle) and somewhere in the middle is Flights of Fantasy, the best gaming bookstore I've ever been to. The Sanford library is also pretty big. ; Don't forget Guitar Center of Wolf Road, I've never seen such a big music store. ; When something says 'On Wolf Road in Albany' it usually means 'On Wolf Road in Colonie.'
