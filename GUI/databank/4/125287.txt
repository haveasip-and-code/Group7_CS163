Andrew Bird
One of the most amazingly talented singer/songwriters in modern music. His lyrics are some of the most mysterious, undecipherable, and beautifully poetic words you'll ever hear. The only thing that matches his gift with lyrics is his talent for creating original, catchy, melodies. This is pop at its best, and this is music that will last the test of time. If you have the chance to see him live, don't pass it up, he is one of the greatest live performers you could ever see.
