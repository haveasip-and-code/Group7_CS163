Newport Coast
What was formerly protected land between Corona Del Mar and Laguna Beach is now home to housing tracks full of low quality mini mansions with essentially the same color scheme. This place is full of new money and people in debt up to their ears. ; It is easy to spot a person from Newport Coast by the following typical signs: ; 1.Drives an H2 with 22' or larger rims. ; 2.Has a LEASED mercedes from fletcher jones. ; 3.Hollywood attitude with a compton bank account. ; ***There are some exceptions which include pro athletes etc. but these people still typically fit into the category of new money and still may exhibit number 1.
