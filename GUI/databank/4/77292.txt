lyrical meltdown
In a band - writting whatever you want to write, no matter what style or how bad it is without fear of receiving non-constructive critisism from the rest of the band. That means that a death metal growler can write acoustic emo songs if he or she wants for the lenght of the meltdown. Done to allow some freedom to your band and boost creativity. The material can later be salvaged and molded to fit the band's overall style.
