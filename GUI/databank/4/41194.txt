neo-nazi
A modern day nazi. Someone who worships Hitler, even though he lost his attempt to destroy Jews and never even made it to the United States. Their whole loser lives is obsessed on destroying non-whites, mainly blacks. They hope to bring back the power of the nazis, but the movement is too weak to ever be successful.
