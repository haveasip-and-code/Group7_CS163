The Arcade Fire
A 5-member band originating from Montreal, Quebec. Known for their lurid beats and definitive sound, they sound a lot like early [David Bowie]. With two main vocalists, a guitarist, a drummer, a violinist, a bass player and who knows what else, we expect promising things from these modern day troubadors. Their album Funeral is a tribute to growing out of childhood, the hopes and dreams, young love, and rebellion we accosiate with growing up.
