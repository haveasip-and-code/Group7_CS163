TNC
means 'Total Non Christian' So basically, it aint just an unbeliever, its a TOTAL unbeliever, could be used as mark of beast in years to come. The bible clearly states thats the mark of the beast will be '666' but i believe, when they look, it will be the letters TNC! (666 meaning TNC) ; TNC's are usually found at Minus 12 on the Engal scale. So if you see someone with the numbers '666' on them, they are a TNC, and a child of satan, and should be avoided ; Term coined by Peter Le Man-Chest-Hair (Manchester, for all you dumb people, and tncs)
