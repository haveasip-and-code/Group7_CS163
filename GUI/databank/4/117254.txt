GLAN
(Noun)Short for GamerzLAN a gaming compound in upstate New York comprised of Computer Gamers who flock to play video games for 10 hours every Saturday. The attendees are known as GLANiacs and are loyal to their one true leader the charasmatic Karza (who is often likened to David Koresh of Waco fame) The gaming flock often showers Karza with gifts such as speakers, PC parts, and even binary clocks to show their appreciation for his guidance and constant supply of Bawls. Some argue that GLAN is a verb used to describe the act of gaming at the GamerzLAN compound.
