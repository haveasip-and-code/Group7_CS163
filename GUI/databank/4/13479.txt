West Virginia
A very discriminated state. A bunch of wankers on this site have been calling it 'nothing but a bunch of rednecks'. Truth is, they couldn't even tell you where that title originated from. In circa 1860 western Virginia broke apart from Virginia to join the Union....Which is AGAINST slavery. The Union was a coalition of states that would fight for a good moral cause against slavery. This is where the term 'redneck' comes into play. Groups of West Virginian guerillas (anyone here know what those are?) fought the South (pro-slavery) while at the time wearing red bandannas around their necks. Thus, earning them the title 'Rednecks'. ; And then there is all of these ignorant kids saying WV is full of hicks and dumbarses. Mind you we have raised the following famous people: Homer Hickam (led the way for NASA with homemade rockets), Chuck Yeager (first person to break the speed of sound and a very accomplished WWII pilot),Booker T. Washington (no, he's not a wrestler so you know, he was the first African American to ever start his own school, The Tuskeegee Institute BTW every West Virginian doesn't watch wrestling as a favorite past time either, I just happened to have glanced at the show before), and there is a lot (not alot, but a lot), lot more who those that were'n't born in West Virginia would even care about, but instead just said 'Hey! I don't know that anyone famous ever came from West Virginia, so how about I bang my head against the keyboard and hope that this poorly put together flame of West Virginia of mine works!' ; Now look at that, I just flamed you bunch of noobs who thought that West Virginia was really just a peice of crap, even though we were home to the Millionaire capitol of the United States in Brambwell, West Virginia. And guess what, this extraordinary dis that showed the true stupidity of some of the United States came from a fourteen year old highschooler. Peace out.
