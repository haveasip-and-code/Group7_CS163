Chronometer
Prior to the invention of the chronometer, pirates did not have an accurate method for measuring time, without which led to them steering off course and sometimes missing their destinations entirely. The chronometer's time-keeping accuracy allowed sailors to measure the stars against specific points in time, thus giving them their longitude. This changed navigation forever by allowing sailors to stay on the correct course to their destination.
