ALSA
Anti Little-Sister Association ; An organization of people who, to say the least, do not have compassion towards their younger female siblings. ; Started at 1999 by Yehonatan Rozenshein (Yoni). Soon joined Netcooler, Abe, Scorp and Psychobunny (Today, 'Rana'). Those were the hard-core ALSA and they remain today. ; Several other people came and go, such as Chiquititas Lover, Tutei Bar and Salion.
