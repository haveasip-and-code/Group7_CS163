house
Pronunciation (hous) ; House Music: The original electronic incarnation from disco. House typically runs around 120 beats per minute (BPM) and uses a 4/4 time sequence and an eight bar repeating cycle. The beat is maintained by a heavy kick drum that alternates in a 1-3 pattern with a high hat accent. Like its disco roots, house often features vocal choruses, real instrumentation, and a more traditional song structure.
