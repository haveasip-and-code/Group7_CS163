killskill
Ability used by snipers, soldiers, ninjas, secret agents, hitmen, and ex-girlfriends to take out a given target in a single move, be it in a virtual or real context. Can be used synonymously with ['deathblow'], but has added elegance - a killskill is always executed deftly and with a fair amount of style.
