El Paso
What is El Paso is an absurd question. ; 'Who is El Paso?' is the real question. ; We, the people of El Paso. El Paso is what we make it. Don't give people a reason to trash talk our city by being only the best you can be. Ask not what El Paso can do for you, but what you can do for El Paso. Stop being selfish and greedy and think about what legacy you shall leave for your grand city. You can be a traitor or a patriot. The choice is simple if you ask me. ; Take pride in where you were born even if it's not perfect. Have enough pride to correct its flaws. Stop littering, stop throwing gum on the sidewalk, let people over on the freeway, stop smoking, and stop getting drunk every weekend and do something to make our city whole again. ; It doesn't matter if El Paso's problems are 'not your fault'. It is your responsibility as a human being to leave the world a better place than you found it. Otherwise, you're nothing but a parasite. You people make me sick. What will you tell your children? That you run from the world's problems rather than confront them? You are not a patriot...you're a coward.
