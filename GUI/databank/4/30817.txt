parents
Most parents are stupid fucks, but the fact is that your future is their [future]. They are trying to live your [life] in a way and the best thing you could do in life is make yourself and your parents [proud] and or [satisfied]. When you become older your life starts to stabalise more so theres no future to work for, thats when people take kids, so they can help them to get into the [world]. ; The problem is that most parents Ive met are [exeggerating] it all.. like why the fuck would you take away someones computer if he or she is checking out some [porn] ; but thats standard for [people] I guess.. so the best thing you could do in that situation is just sit down and talk with them and come to a [conclusion], its [normally] [reasonable] for both parties. Except of course if your parents are absolutely [insane], and then Id get some [professional] attension since then you got a serious [problem] ; Seriously, [kids] and parents gotto [live] together so you must be able to come to some reasoning [together] ; Oh and also, as a kid you get angry for no real [reason], just think about that one
