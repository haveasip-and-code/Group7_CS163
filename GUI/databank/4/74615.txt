English style
A spliff loaded with a combination of tobacco and marijuana. Significantly wider around than a normal joint, the English-style spliff is tapered, and the bigger end is lit while smoking. The addition of plain tobacco to the weed makes for a smoother, more pleasant smoke, and extends the burning time.
