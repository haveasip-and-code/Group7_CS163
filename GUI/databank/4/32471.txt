The fakey, out-of-a-box Irishness that insists on the same damned songs and the same damned menu and the same damned Guinness advertisements on the wall of every Irish bar outside of Ireland. ; Seen in nearly every film which features a non Irish actor doing an Irish accent. Notable exceptions include Daniel Day Lewis in 'In The Name of The Father' and Bradd Pitt in 'Snatch'.
