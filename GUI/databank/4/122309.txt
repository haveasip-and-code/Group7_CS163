japanese hater
Generally young Chinese or Koreans living in America with no personal/direct recollection of the brutalities imposed by past Japanese on their ancestors. Despite current haters having little tangible tie to this past, many insist on perpetuating Japanese vs. Korean/Chinese abhorrence by attempting to degrade the Japanese culture though spiteful stereotype and other forms of cultural and racial demean. By doing this, certain Chinese or Koreans begin to view themselves and their cultures at a higher level than the Japanese. This, in itself, is a form of racial and cultural supremacy- a blatant hypocrisy for any Chinese or Korean who holds antipathy towards the 'bigoted Japanese'.
