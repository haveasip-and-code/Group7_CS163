call in threat
Not calling someone and threatening them but the worry you feel over getting [called in] to work whenever the phones rings on your day off. ; While this usually only applies to part time workers, it can also apply to full time workers when [called in] to work overtime. ; Sometimes it gets so bad that: ; * You're afraid to pick up the phone and/or will screen all calls (and will be very thankfull for caller ID) ; * You'll be unable to sleep in at all because you cannot relax because they might call. ; * You'll be afraid to make plans of any kind because you might get called in. (ie, it's your birthday or a relatives birthday and you have the day off and want to take them out for supper, but are afraid to plan beyond 'if I don't get [called in] maybe we could' because you cannot count on actually having the day off) ; * You cannot relax even in hobbies that used to give you great joy because the worry you're going to get [called in]. ; Depending on the nature of the hours you work, after a certain time durring the day you can probably relax as a call in is unlikley after that point. However, if they can also call in you in to work a night shift, it can continue all day :(.
