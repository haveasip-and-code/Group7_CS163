Pristontale
Korean leveling threadmill cleverly disguised as a massive multiplayer online game ([Everquest], [WoW], [Eve Online]). Also known as PT. It involves the following: ; 1. mindlessly killing mobs (mobs = monsters); ; 2. gaining items from said mobs (items = better equipment = increased killing efficiency); ; 3. leveling up after killing an astronomical number of said mobs (leveling = more stat points = increased killing efficiency); ; 4. accessing higher level maps with stronger mobs which render your new equipment upgrades and stat points void; ; 5. jump back to #1 and repeat indefinitely ; On very rare ocassions and after a significant amount of time spent inside this senseless and time-consuming loop, you may achieve enlightment and be able to skip to #6: ; 6. in a flash of insight, you realize that playing PT is the equivalent of being brain dead and quit for good, denouncing all [mmorpg]s as the brainchildren of [satan] and make a witty entry on urbandictionary as your final contribution to the game that has sucked out 2 years of your life; ; It is also one of the few online multiplayer games where soloing is more efficient than partying, which promotes a healthy anti-social attitude that will make you unable to function in society ever after.
