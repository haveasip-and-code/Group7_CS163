pappyslap
n. an admonishment or scolding from your father (or -- whoever's the boss man of your house) which is delivered in front of another family member(s), usually the boss woman of the house, to make it seem like you are being properly disciplined for bad behavior, but in reality the dressing down is for show, and you know the one scolding is on your side, has no issue with your actions, and is just pretending to be righteous to appease the other family member. [To be distinguished from a pappyslam, which is a show of genuine anger and/or disgust.] ; v. to scold a youth still under one's watch without seriousness in fact, but to satisfy the demands of another authoritative family member.
