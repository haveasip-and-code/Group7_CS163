War of 1812
This is in reference to Bob's comment. ; The war WAS between Canada and the States. ; You have to ask yourself Bob, where did your decendents originate from. The Americians didn't row over to engage in war with the British people on their island. They picked a fight with the people who lived in Canada..therefore, they were Canadians. ; I would say the Americians were far less independent then the people of Canada were during this time...Again, this topic isn't about where the people of the United States and Canada originated from.
