menai
A suburb in Sydney Australia. What's not to love, between the friendly locals spitting at your door, driving around at 2am in their 'look, this noisy car is a metaphor for my big penis' vehicles and smashing things left, right and centre. Oh yeah, who could forget those wittily named local hangouts like 'Menai Marketplace', 'Menai Metro', 'Parc Menai' and of course, Australia's only nuclear reactor! It's the ultimate cosmopolitan suburb.
