Mechanicsville
Mechanicsville, VA. This is a country town that is rapidly expanding into Richmond. We used to be a primarily rural community, until Italian's from Jersey like me moved in and defiled the town. Now there are cars everywhere, and the roads aren't big enough to accomodate the growing population. Our only sources of entertainment in the ville are an AMF bowling ring and skate america. A couple redeeming quality's about mechanicsville are that you can buy drugs quite easily and cigarettes are the cheapest in the USA. Most of the people you speak to will say they want to get out of mechanicsville. It is not a land of opportunity, but a land of uneducated blue collar rednecks. Your employment options are either working at walmart, government jobs, or in a school. Our average income is something like 30,000 a year. It is nearly impossible to find yourself a women for the night unless if you travel down to the midway by Lee Davis, but most of the women there are 30+. Midway is our only adult source of entertainment, besides the endless amount of restaurants you see, which is why you see a lot of fat bastards walking around. Basically, if you stick around Mechanicsville, you will observe it's own decay, as I have in the past 10 years I've lived here. ; You are surrounded by fat bastards, boredom, drugs, no women, and no source of entertainment. And worst all, Aunt Susan's cat giving birth to 3 kittens makes the front page.
