Vatsim
Virtual Air Traffic Simulation. A hobbyist organisation for Flight Simulation Enthusiasts to fly a multiplayer online session with air traffic controll provided by enthusiasts using a Simulated Radar Air Traffic Controll screen called ASRC. All participants on the network can see each other, even with theoretically all 70,000 users online at once.
