trent
aka TrentU, Trent University site: www.trentu.ca ; A small university in Ontario, Canada in the city of Peterborough. Peterborough is located approx 1 hour 40 minutes NorthEast of Toronto. This university is known for small class sizes and a close teach-student relationship. You are not just another number, everyone knows each other. The Environmental Engineering program is one of the best in Canada. ; Also known for the drunken hoe's in the 11pm Pub-Bus, the Trent Queer Collective (guys making out on the bridge over Lake Champlain) and an amazing international student association (TISA) and a kick ass MSA (TMSA). The city literally closes down at 4:30pm and everything shuts down (except 'the rooster' and galaxy cinemas). Primary industry (if you can call it that) is senior citizens housing.
