melamine
Stuff found in crappy appartment kitchens all over North America. It's basically an off-white plastic that absorbs crap like cigarette smoke like nuts and turns yellow. Popular in the 80's, god knows why. God knows why most things in the 80's were popular. ; If you have melamine, do yourself the favor of either removing it or setting your house on fire.
