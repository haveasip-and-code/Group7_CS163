Those who don't live in Darien tend to be wildly jealous. Teens in Darien tend to spend their free time shopping for $200 jeans and drinking. Adults spend their time working, finding more houses and trying to figure out how to be better than everyone else. Darien is one of the richest towns in the United States.
