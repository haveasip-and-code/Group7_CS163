new trier
Ode to New Trier -- A place full of popped collars, Juicy tube tops, and wannabe goths that hang out in the scrounge. Froshies go to a different campus, Lag/Pot makes sense to all of us, and the senior parking lot is full of BMW's and Jeeps that willingly pay $300 for a spot. Kate Spade, Seven jeans, Lacoste will be found no matter where you turn. We win everything, are smarter than you, and look better while doing it. Oh yeah, and Mean Girls was based off New Trier. BEAT THAT BITCHES!!
