california
I live in California. I don't surf, I hate rap music, I went to LA once, and it sucked, Hollywood is overrated, the weather is NOT perfect, I only went to the beach once in my life and I hated it, YES, the governor sucks, no, not all the people are 'hot' (thats total bullshit. People always say the people are ALL hot whenever they write a definition about their state.), the schools were good until Arnold(governor) went and took all the money; there are hicks here, there are PLENTY of stupid people, but an equal amount of intelligent people as well, I have lived here all my life, and have only felt two earthquakes, and California isn't going to sink into the ocean anytime soon. However, if you look past all this, California really isn't all that bad of a place to live. It just takes the most shit from other states.
