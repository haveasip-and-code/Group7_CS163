The Dan Band
The Dan Band is best well known as the wedding band from the movie Old School, in which they performed a profane arrangement of Bonnie Tyler's 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' (they also performed the song 'Lady'), and as the Bat Mitzvah band performing a sultry, seductive, and maybe pedophilic version of George Benson's 'I feel like making love' in the movie Starsky & Hutch. ; The lead singer of the band is Dan Finnerty and he is originally from Bath, New York. ; The band's first LP was released in April, 2005 on Side One Dummy Records and is a live recording of one of their many sold out shows.
