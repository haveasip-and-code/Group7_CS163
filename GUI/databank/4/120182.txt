Bum Call
A bum call is caused by accidentally sitting on your mobile phone without realising it. it takes beteween 5 to 30 minutes to hear that your Buttoks have somehow pressed exactly the right combination of buttons to get onto the phonebook setting and call a friend who you've never actually called before.
