Cape Girl
A Cape Girl is beautiful, in touch with nature, because she has grown up in the salt water of the most beautiful beaches there are. This fact accounts for impeccable hair and skin, easy-going and free lifestyle, and overall groundedness. A true Cape Girl is a local, and knows the ins and outs of sandy backroads and paths through the woods. She loves campfires, the beach, barbeques, and life all around.
