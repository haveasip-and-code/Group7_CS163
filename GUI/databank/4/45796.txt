you are the father
A sentence that can be heard on the mind-numbing Maury Povich show, which is a show that I watch every day after school but won't admit it. ; This sentence is used usually after some ugly black woman is crying because she slept around with 15 guys and got pregnant and now she doesn't know her baby's father is.
