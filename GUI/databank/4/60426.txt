Zurajin
A huggable, loveable troll, the Zurajin is by far the most awesome of the troll species. Left alone in its natural environment, the Zurajin is oft found at play with the various species of monkey, finding a special affinity for Trunkus Munkus. Should you ever see a Zurajin, treat it kindly, for you may be rewarded with the famous 'l33t wolf dance', but be forewarned, tackles accompanied by huggles and tickles may ensue.
