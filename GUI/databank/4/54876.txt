green day fan
There are three types of [Green Day] fans out there. ; 1) Older fan: Someone who has been listening to Green Day since the early 90s. GD may not be their favourite band, but it certainly is one of their favourites. Usually doesn't care too much about what you think about them. However, they laugh at the New/American Idiot Fans. ; 2) Quazi-New fans: These individuals have been listening to Green Day since about when Warning was released. They tend to do a great deal of research on the band to communicate with the Older Fans. Tend to hate the New/American Idiot Fans. ; 3) New/American Idiot Fans: As the name implies, these are the 'fans' who started liking Green Day once American Idiot was released. Their age usually ranges from 11-14, they're most likely [mall punk], and they research Green Day to the point of insanity because 'OMG Billy Joe iz so HOT!!!11! OMG OMG OMG I WOULD SO FUCK HIM!!' They usually make 'sex/story' quizes about the band, claim they know everything about the band based on what they read on Amazon.com, and are insanely obnoxious. See [poseur].
