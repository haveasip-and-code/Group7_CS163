Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers
A great band from the 70's. They played in CBGB'S, as did [The Ramones]. They were punk (obviously, after all by this time that's almost all I write about). This was the incarnation of The Heartbreakers, after [Richard Hell] left to start The Voidoids. The Heartbreakers were on [The Sex Pistols] Anarchy In The UK Tour.
