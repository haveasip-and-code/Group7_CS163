wang-wagging
A catch-all term that covers various forms of egregious and self-serving boasting about one's sex life - particularly when such boasting occurs over the internet. ; Like the famous Supreme Court quote about pornography - wang-wagging is something that is difficult to define, but easy to recognize when one sees it. There are a few basic types of wang-wagging ; Type One (Bragging to One's Friends): ; For instance, whenever dudes are hanging out in an informal setting talking about their sex lives, wang-wagging will inevitably occur as one or more of the dudes in the conversation feels a competitive desire to exaggerate the details of his sex life - so as to 'one up' another member of the group or to attain some form of status in the group. ; Type Two (Bragging on the Internet): ; Wang-wagging is particularly prevalent on the internet - especially on message boards, where male posters often go to great lengths to make exaggerated claims about their sexual prowess, and to denigrate the sexual prowess of other posters. ; Type Three (Subtle): ; In my opinion, dudes who feel the need to bring-up the fact that they have a girlfriend (or post about their girlfriends), even in conversations (or threads) that have nothing to do with sex - are engaging in a form of wang-wagging. By bringing up one's girlfriend in an irrelevant context, it is as if one is saying 'Hey! I need others to acknowledge that I am cool/sexy/virile enough to have a girlfriend - so I am going to bring her up and talk about her - even though she has nothing to do with the topic of our conversation.'
