Electric Lemonade
An alcoholic concoction of beer, vodka, and lemmonade concentrate. In a large cooler combine a 30 pack of beer (Miller HighLife works well as it has no taste), a one liter bottle of vodka (don't go too cheep, I recomend Smirnoff or Iceburg), and 5 cans of lemmonade concentrate (under no circumstances should u use any other brand other than minute maid brand or your batch will taste like absolute shit). dump all this shit into a large cooler, stir it up, dump in a couple bags of ice and enjoy.
