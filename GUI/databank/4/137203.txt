Nassau
The county west of Suffolk and east of Queens on Long Island. Mostly filled with disgustingly rich people, and most of them are Jewish. The rest who are not rich are mostly Jewish as well. Also, the resting place of the commonly known 'annoying Long Island accent.' Know that this is the only place where you will hear that kind of shit on Long Island.
