Littler
Littler is a grammatically incorrect word that is used by too many Americans and especially by females. When a speaker uses the word littler in a sentence, such as 'That boy is littler than the other' it makes the speaker sound like a completely uneducated [nimrod]. The correct wording would be small or smaller. See [Nutt-Racket] post from 'Jenna the Great' to see such intelligence.
