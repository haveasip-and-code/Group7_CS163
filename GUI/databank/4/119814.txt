Breath of Fire 4
This is the fourth installment to the wonderful RPG series known as Breath of Fire. In this installment, the story takes place, not around Ryu, but around Nina, a princess of Wyndia, who is searching for her missing sister alongside Cray, a member of a Tiger-like race known as the Woren. Nina encounters Ryu shortly after the game begins, and as time goes on you will learn more about who he is.. and about a person named Fou-lu, who seems to share many things with young Ryu. I highly recommend this game to anyone, it is available for the Playstation console.
