Nuclear Winter
The predicted climate condition resulting from a large scale nuclear war. The explosions would launch enormous amounts of particles of dust and soot into the stratosphere, and the ashes could remain there for weeks to years. The sunlight would be blocked, and the combination of darkness, cold, radiation, and destruction of world infrastructure by the nuclear bombs could easily wipe out much plant life, including necessary crops. This would in turn cause starvation up through the food chain, eventually causing a massive exctinction of all life on the planet.
