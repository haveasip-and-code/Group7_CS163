mescaline
A psychedelic of the phenethylamine family which occurs naturally in certain cactuses. Contrary to popular belief it is very seldom found in pure chemical form due to the production difficulties and costs. In the hands of the open-minded and intelligent people it can be a great instrument for the exploration of the psyche.
