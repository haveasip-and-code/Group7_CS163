saturday night special
A [liberal] expression meaning an inexpensive handgun. (Of course, the REAL definition of an inexpensive handgun is CHEAP INSURANCE.) ; Liberal politicians tell [yuppie] and [soccer mom] constituents that they will ban Saturday Night Specials, which makes the yuppies and soccer moms feel all warm and fuzzy. ; Of course, banning inexpensive handguns deprives poor people of their most effective defense against [Pachuco] boys and other criminals.
