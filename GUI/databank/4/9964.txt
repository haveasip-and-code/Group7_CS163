4Kids
Company responsible for butchering the anime Shaman King. I picked up the manga and thought it was awesome but then watched the show in horror. Manta's name is now Mortimer (what did he do to deserve that name?) and Ren's name is replaced with Lenny. The horror! Ren sounds like a british priss now even though he's Chinese. Then 4kids thought, 'Let's put a spanish accent on a Japanese guys! The fans should be really pissed now!' ; Oh, and they just liscenced Naruto. What is this world coming to????
