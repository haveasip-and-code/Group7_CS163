metaphor
A poetic device used to draw comparison, or illustrate a parallel relationship between two different subjects. More or less the same as a simile, except omitting the word 'like;' as in the following example- METAPHOR- Life is a box of chocolates./SIMILE- Life is like a box of chocolates. Confusion over these two techniques has resulted in untold disasters throughout the history of language.
