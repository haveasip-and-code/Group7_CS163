hot coffee
Hot Coffee deals with the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. ; In this game, the developers included a mini game in which the player could control the main character (CJ) having sex with various women. It was later on decided that the game should be removed because it was pushing the limit on its mature rating. Instead of taking out the mini game, it was locked away and never to be accessed by any gamer. ; The game was released for PS2 and everything was going smoothly, until it's PC release. It wasn't long before somebody cracked into GTA:SA and found the hot coffee scenes. ; The ESRB, who is responsible for rating video games, was outraged and recalled all the games. The rating was changed from Mature (17+) to Adult Only (18+). ; Although GTA:SA received a lot of criticism for it's intense violence, graphic language, drug content, etc. It didn't get bashed as much as it did for it's hot coffee mini game. ; Which I personally find ridiculous. The game was already restricted to minors. ; All this proves is that sex and nudity is worse then violence. Way to go Hilary Clinton, you score another point in our society.
