Blue Shift
1. The political change of the United States in favor of liberalism. ; 2. A commercial expansion pack for the popular computer game Half-Life that is commonly mocked with the name 'Blue Shit'. In my opninion, it is a good expansion that gets lots of hate for being a little too short. It also included the high definition pack for Half-Life and Half-Life: Opposing force which enchanced the graphics with new 3D models.
