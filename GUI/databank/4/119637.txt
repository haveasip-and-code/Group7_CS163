trebuchet
A category of hurling device (catapult), consisting of a large beam, a sling, a counterwieght, and a frame. The beem is mounted to the frame by an axle about 1/3rd to 1/5th from one end. A sling is attached to the long end of this beam and a counterweight to the shorter end. The machine is then cocked by pulling the longer end of the beam or throwing arm downward and locking it with some sort of trigger system. Upon release, the counterweight pulls on the short end of the beam causing the long end to swing upward and forward, followed by the sling. The sling then releases the projectile and hurls it toward the unfortunate target, whatever it may be.
