Mercy High School - Rochester NY
All girls catholic high school in Roc city (brother school: MCQ)- you can bet most of the girls come from probably Pittsford, Penfield, or Webster. It wouldn't be uncommon for one to pull a hundred dollar bill out of their wallet..and that would probably be the least amount of cash they'd have on them. The school's known for their sports, especially Soccer (a cult which is known as AJAX..), Softball, and Basketball(they breed their athletes...), as well as its 'college-prep' (for parties that is..., although others may interpret that as going IVY). The girls at Mercy definitely known how to party...
