mon
the word used by stupid fuckin americans whenever they talk about or refer to jamaica or jamaicans. jamaicans do not say mon, nor do any other caribbean people. please do all caribbean people a favor and take your head out of your ass and realize that the world isn't like what you see in the movies.
