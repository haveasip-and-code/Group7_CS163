brasserie
In provence of Quebec, a traditional French-Canadian pub which serves wine and beer, (especially microbrew) along with a meal of steak, rosst beef, hamberger platters, fresh fish, etc... All at almost rediculously low prices for the quality of the meal and the superb atmosphere. They tend to be small family-run business with eccentric flair. Short form: brass
