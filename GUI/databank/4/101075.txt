Leg Spin
The art of leg spin, a bowling technique used in the wonderful game of cricket. Seemed to be dying out until Australia produced Shane Warne, who is now the leading wicket taker in test cricket history. With the appearance of Warne on the scene, this helped leg-spin to become more popular but England still haven't produced an international class legspinner since Padgett.
