leave it to beaver
A campy 1950s TV show with a perfect family living in suburbia. There's the all knowing father, the happy homemaker mother, the wise older brother, and the goofy and kindhearted younger brother. Often referred to as an example of 1950s quaintness and 'simpler times.' Reruns can be seen on TVLand.
