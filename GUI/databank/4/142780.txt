schnickelfritzs
The term, 'schnickelfritz,' used to be a commonly used term, in place of the word 'thing.' it is derived from two ancient words of the ancient Babylonian and Mesopotamian languages; schnickel and fritz. A schnickel is a popular ghetto term for a monetary unit of exchange used in the United States, the nickel, worth 5 cents. A fritz is a popular, but not so popular term for a broken down German soldier. It was a piece of American military slang during the times of WWII. 'Schnickelfritz' is now an unpopular term used by the almost-but-not-so-cool teenagers of [s-dub]. It won in a popularity contest against the word [offie], and then lost in the meaningless banter in the WB network's [Gilmore Girls], and is now used as a light insult to random, unsuspecting people who think it sounds schway.
