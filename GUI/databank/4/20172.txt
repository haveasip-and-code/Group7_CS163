Smoke and a pancake
Originally used by Mike Myers in 'Austin Powers: Goldmember' as a joke about Dutch people. The whole movie (for whatever reason) is riddled with anti-Dutch jokes. This phrase was intended to highlight two of the popular stereotypes of Holland: marijuana and sweet confections. There really is no deeper meaning other than to play on these stereotypes. Since the release of the movie, the term has gained popularity as a general reference to marijuana use, and the 'munchies' that may follow.
