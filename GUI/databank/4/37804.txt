Millburn High
nHallways filled left to right with JAPs (jewish american princesses) with tightest asses, the biggest noses, and flattest abs who back it up with ample privelege from Daddy. Drinking with lawyers, executives, doctors, and the occasional judge is quite the norm. The question is not how much the item is, its how many you have purchase. Children of connected privelege; where SAT's dont matter and educations are given away through connections like invitations. ; The people who commute out of this town all have hooked up jobs. The people who commute into our town do our laundry and clean our houses.
