Mustang
An American sports car introduced in April, 1964, as part of Ford's 1965 model year line-up. Originally available in coupe and convertible styles, it later added a fastback option. Notable models include the '69-'70 BOSS models (302/429), the '65-'67 Shelby-built models (G.T.350/G.T.500), and the '69-'73 and '03-'04 Mach 1 models. The Ford Mustang underwent a major redesign in 2005. It now bares resemblance to the '68 fastback models.
