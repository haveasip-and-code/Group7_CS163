Plymouth
An automobile marque made by the Chrysler Corporation. Was usually the #3 make of car in the 'cheap three', [Ford], [Chevy]([Chevrolet]), and Plymouth. Unfortunately for many, [DiamlerChrylser] axed Plymouth in 2001, but some of its models, including the Prowler and Voyager, were absorbed into the Chrysler marque. (The Chrysler Voyager has since been discontinued)
