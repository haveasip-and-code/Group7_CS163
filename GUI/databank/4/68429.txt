the birthday massacre
A rock band from Toronto, Canada. A truly remarkable blend of fantasy and horror. While one might use words like 'metal,' 'goth,' or even 'powerpop' to describe such a sound, 'dreamy' and 'surreal' do the band far more justice. It's a sound so uniquely visual, you might describe it more like a painting or a feeling. It's as if the story of David Fincher's 'Seven' appeared like 'Alice in Wonderland,' but everything was a creamy shade of violet.
