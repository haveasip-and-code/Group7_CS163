tmmlmb
Created by the legendary Funky_Del as a more fitting replacement for [lol]; means 'That made me lick my balls!'. To be more precise, [lol] in messaging services nowadays is more of a general part of a sentence, like a full stop or comma, than to mean you actually 'laughed out loud', and in contrast 'lmao' seems too much to use for things that are only vaguely funny. Therefore, tmmlmb was created.
