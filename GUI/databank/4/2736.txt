DELAWARE, the greatest small wonder on earth.....rrright. Here's Delaware in a nutshell for yah; three counties: New Castle, Kent, Sussex. If you don't live in New Castle county, your most likely white trash who spends your days fucking chickens or your sister(yes, there's more chickens in the state of DE than there are people). New Castle is the only respectable county in DE with the only respectable towns and cities. Kent and Sussex counties would make my dog vomit in disgust.
