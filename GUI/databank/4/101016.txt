Netidiot
Classification for people who incessantly post heated and insulting rebuttal messages in web forums. Nothing better to do than anonymously harass others online, it seems. A more productive use of their time would include thinking of ways to kill themselves. Instead, they submit volumes of circular text that always fails to make a point or debunk the original author's statements with any validity. ; The exchange can spiral out of control in a few different ways, usually after the original author responds to the comments. Often, the netidiot is incited by author's reply, as though somehow shocked that someone they verbally assaulted would treat them with the same manner in return. ; Most notable is the netidiot's obvious emotional instability, and failure to recognize when they've been outwit and defeated. Remarkably, they always insist that any number of other posts that disagree with them are 'stupid.'
