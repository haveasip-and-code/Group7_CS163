Fodder
This orginated from the Newlands Park Kavos Tour 04, in which Mark 'Bertwhistle' Smith, would pull some hideous looking creatures! ; He was told he seems to get with rather over weight and strange looking women, normally refered to as whales! Icepole then spoke of Whales feast on to keep healthy (he knows lots of random rubbish)a food chain called FODDER! Hense Mark 'Bertwhistle' Smith is refered to as the fodder hunter, is search of emense Whales, that would gladdly take a bite of him! ; Fodder: overweight women, with not much going for them!
