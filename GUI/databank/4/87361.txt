Insists that they are Bumiputra(native)and should have more privileges aka 80%quota to universities,Malay-only scholarships,Malay-only houses,Malay-only land,etc etc but doesn't realise that the Chinese and Indians have been there WAYYYYYYYYY before the colonization era;and the Malays themselves are not local,they are actually a South Chinese origin.Don't belive me?Many Malays have a surname Wan-for example Wan Abdullah,Wan Ahmad,Wan Noraini.Clearly a Chinese one no?The Orang Aslis are the REAL natives because they have been living in Malaysia since the Stone Ages,but ironically they are not entitled to any Bumiputra privileges. ; A race who claims to be friendly,but clearly shows great xenophobia when a non-malay neighbour moves in,and taxi drivers have been known not to take black people.They hate Jewish people a lot,because of their Muslim religion.In fact Jewish tourists who have been to Malaysia pretend they are Caucasian. ; In class,they are the dumbest dumbest of the lot.Yet they get admitted to public universities 80% of the time thanks to the racist goverment.As a result they graduated unemployed because their English sucks and,but turn the tables around and say that the employers are racist.They blame their pathetic pampered lives on other people(other races?)and not the fact that they are too lazy and dependent to acheive sucess.
