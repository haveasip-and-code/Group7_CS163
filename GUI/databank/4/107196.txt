H. G. Wells
(1866-1946) British writer best known for his science fiction novels, such as 'The Time Machine', 'The Invisible Man', and 'The War of the Worlds'. The latter book inspired two movie renditions (1953, 2005), and Orson Welles' famed 1938 radio broadcast, which panicked many listeners, who thought they were listening to news reports of an actual Martian invasion of New Jersey. Wells, who studied with the great British biologist T.H. Huxley, was also an accomplished popularizer of science.
