computurd
That one type of crappy computer that is found in every school, business, and old folks' home. It's covered in dust and grime, the CD drive doesn't work, and its running Windows 95 and AOL 4.0. When people say 'fix my computer', they're talking about their computurd. Its not even worth looking at.
