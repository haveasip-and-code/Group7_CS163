Hemi
Old Mopar engines used in Dodge/Chrysler cars such as Chargers, Super Bee's, Road Runners, Challengers, and other muscle cars. The name was derived for Hemispherical cylinder heads using a SOHC design. The new 'Hemi's' are not actually Hemi's, but just a copyrighted name used to sell cars. New Hemi engines are simply a waste of fuel, space, and money. Dodge achives it's power these day by low-tech cheap in-efficient engines. With Chevy you get about the same performance with about double the MPG. Dodge talks about their new Viper-powered V-10 Ram, which is the fastest stock pickup in the world. Well last time I checked, people don't by pickups to go fast, they buy them for hauling shit. ; Dodge Sucks.
