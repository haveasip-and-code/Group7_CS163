Dimmu Borgir
Possibly the worst band in the history of music, and I use the term 'band' loosely here, because its not so much a band as it is a bunch of dirty dumbasses screeching about TORMENTING A CHRISTIAN SOUL while chaining eachother up with leashes and fucking eachother in the asshole. Their music is horrible and is mainly there just because you have to play music to be a band, their main priority is worshipping 'Satan' and creating a bunch of worthless Demon Butt acolytes that wear black and think its cool to set fire to goats. Definetley a no-listener.
