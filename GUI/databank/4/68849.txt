The supercoolest friend anyone can ever have. Someone who is there for you. And someone who can make you laugh so hard that you cry. Someone who doesn't mind going through the 'ghetto' with you. Someone who will bring you mountain dew amp so you can be hyper (although it didn't really work). Someone who likes carmel... not gonna go there. Someone who thinks that D-B is supercool and who can't spell scrumdiliumpcious (or however you spell it). Someone who is your best friend ever!
