Hypochristian
(N) A person who states that they are a Christian, believe in Christian values, and may even preach the gospel, yet are hateful and unforgiving. Such a person will often talk of the love of Jesus, will talk of morals, will talk of doing good, but will hold people to high expectations, may be judgmental, and extremely prideful.
