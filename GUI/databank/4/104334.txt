Salvia
An amazingly potent plant of the mint family, closely related to Sage. This plant, no matter what extraction, produces amazing spacey effects on the user, and should only be taken in small doses until the user is completely comfortable with it. Side effects can include fear and paranoia, usually associated with overly nervous users, and large doses.
