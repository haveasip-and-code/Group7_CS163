Lavy
A word used to substitute the word 'lady' or 'baby' in songs, especially when substituting the word 'lunch' for 'love'. See the classic example below. ; This word is derived from Joe Lavy, a guy who enjoys lunch, and also is a volunteer firefighter, and many times can be seen guarding the beer tent. He's actually not a bad kid, and it's not his fault he likes lunch, or that we sing his name in songs and giggle about it.
