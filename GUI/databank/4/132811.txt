chicken tremors
A state of mild imitation that occurs before/during/after the eating of a copius amount of chicken wing. It is said to result from the prolonged outcroping of the elbows (the quintessential chicken wing eating position) and the adjustment of putting said elbows to rest. Although, like a fiend to a needle, pure anticipation for the delicious chicken wing is said to contribute to the tremor. Symptoms include sweating, shakes (tremors) and a eager/full stomach.
