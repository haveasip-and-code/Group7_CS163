Newton Massachusetts
A rich snobby city located 15 minutes from boston. The majority of people are white and the ones that aren't should be considered white. An average day in the life of a 'newtonite' is spent by using their daddy's credit cards and doing drugs. Everyone in newton owns more than one house and about 5 cars. The daily uniform is northface and uggs, no matter the weather for girls. The dress code for guys is a preppy polo (a known label, polo, lacoste) and khaki's. All the kids cosider themselves gods gift to the world which their mothers reinforce that idea. There's no such thing as a bad grade, because their mommy's and daddies get them out of it.
