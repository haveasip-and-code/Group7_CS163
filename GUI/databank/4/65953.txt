gass
Gass means bad or crappy, generally used to refer to 'Magic the Gathering' decks. The only guy who actually uses this word is a short, overweight male named 'Chet' who never showers and spends all day and night spamming various messageboards. He is IP banned from five of said sites. He usually goes on as Raymoooond.
