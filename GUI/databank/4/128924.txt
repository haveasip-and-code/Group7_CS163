Gothip
Discussion of other people's habits and/or behaviour within the [goth] scene. This type of [gossip], generally transmitted by people wearing too much eyeliner, spreads in a particularly virulent fashion due to the goth addiction to drama and the need to insult anyone who looks better in pvc pants than you do.
