The End of Eva
The End of Eva is the true ending to the popular [anime], [Neon Genesis Evangelion]. This film is the way episodes 25 and 26 were ment to be seen. The original episodes 25 and 26 were mared by a lack of funding and time, they were poorly animated, extremly confusing and lacked a cohesive plot. The fans through a shit fit and the studio pulled more money together to stop the toraid of death threats and made the end of eva. This is probably the most fucked up animated movie ever.
