dating
Basically when you're boyfriend/girlfriend. Like if you ask the person out and they say yes, then you guys are dating/are in a relationship. ; Be careful not to mistake someone asking you out on a date like 'do you want to go out?' (as in go to the movies) with going out as boyfriend/girlfriend, because it can create confusion. It has happened to me before.
