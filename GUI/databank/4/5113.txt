I have absolutely no fucking clue what this means. It comes from the Texas A&M University fight song. ; I can't help but laugh at the Aggies.... their entire fight song is devoted to beating UT in football, a feat they've failed to accomplish more often than not as the overall tally of the yearly showdown stands at 72-34 (and 5 ties) in favor of the University of Texas. ; Oh well. Let them have their fun I suppose. We all know UT is better. :) ; I'm still lost regarding the meaning of this Aggie hillbilly colloquialism... if anyone can enlighten me about the meaning or origin, please feel free. Thanks! ; Oh. While you're at it... explain this line too: ; 'Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!' ; Once again, I'm speechless. Is that English? or Aggie-jibberish?
