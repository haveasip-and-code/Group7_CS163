Dinobot
From the Canadian CGI show, [Beast Wars]. Dinobot was a [Predacon], the descendants of [Decepticons], who challenged Megatron's authority and was therefore expelled. He attempted to become leader of the [Maximals], descendants of the [Autobots], but ended up becoming part of [Optimus Primal]'s group. Dinobot was irritable, impatient, would choose to utterly annihilate his foes as opposed to giving them a chance to surrender, had the attitude from hell, and...well...ate his clone. ; However, despite all his flaws, Dinobot was one of the most honorable characters in the entire show. He showed this in the centerpiece of the second season 'Code of Hero.' Dinobot, in a final act of heroism, beat all of the Decepticons into retreat to preserve the valley where humans would come into existance and evolve into the homo sapiens of today. But to do so, Dinobot sacrificed his life. Exhausted, battered, and near death, Dinobot created a makeshift hammer and smashed it into Megatron's chest, making the golden disk, which allowed Megatron to alter Earth's future, fly out of a hidden compartment. Dinobot caught it and, transferring all of his remaining power into his eye beams, destroyed it. He collapsed to the ground as shards of the disk fell around him. The Maximals arrived shortly after and were in time to say there final words before Dinobot's spark rose from his body to join the Matrix alongside the heroes of Cybertron.
