P.I.B.
Abbreviation for Put-In-Bay, Ohio. An island located in Lake Erie which becomes overrun by party people during the summer months. It is the equivalent to spring break for adults. It is common knowledge that what happens on the island, stays on the island, usually because the person is too drunk to remember anyway.
