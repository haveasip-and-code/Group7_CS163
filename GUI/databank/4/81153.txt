A programmer whose mental age approximates to six (6), has the tenactity of a brick wall and the intellect to match a single brick in a staring contest. He thinks that honest programmers should be financially restrained and unable to profit from their own work, and should give away their work for free under all circumstances. ; He models the Internet upon totalitarian regimes which censor anything opposed to his simple-minded definition of 'good'. Also see [Stalin], [Hitler], [communism] and [Microsoft].
