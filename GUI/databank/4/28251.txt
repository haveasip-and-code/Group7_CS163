serbs
Serbs are European people who speak a Slavic language related to other Slavic languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech, and Bulgarian. The Serbs have lived in the Balkans since the 6th century AD. They moved in from the north and east of Europe as part of a huge wave of resettlement known as the 'migration of the peoples,' which occurred during and after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. This wave of settlers also included other Slavs that miagrated later on, who would eventually become the Croats, Bosnians, and Bulgarians. Each of these groups formed their own medieval kingdoms at different times.
