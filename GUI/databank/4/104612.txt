Rhodes College
A sorry excuse for students to keep pretending their in still in highschool. The honor code includes a sharing policy which covers everything from your panties to your boyfriend. The only recreation is drinking so learn to hold your alcohol but if you can't, being to' up from tha flo' up is an excuse for anything. Class is optional but parties are not. Put your drinking face on.
