breakcore
Breakcore was started by gabber producers that began to get tired of 4/4 beats and wanted to experiment with the [gabber] sound. It has become a highly technical experimental genre that goes against musical theory yet still sustains to being effective music. Breakcore can either be dead serious or the funniest shit u've ever heard. Bassically [Gabber] + [Drum and Bass]
