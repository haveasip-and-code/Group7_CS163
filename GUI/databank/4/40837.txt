Numa Numa
Though it's scientific name is Dragostea Din Tei, this virus is more commonly known as Numa Numa in North America. The virus enters through your ears, gets absorbed into your bloodstream, and attacks the brain. The virus cripples your judgement over good music, and you begin to love crazy techno-pop.
