Great Bridge
Part of [Chesapeake] in the [757] part of Virginia. While Chesapeake is populated by hicks and some black people near [Norfolk], Great Bridge is populated with [scene] kids. Perhaps the only area so densly populated with scenesters, Great Bridge has become a Mecca for those who wish to live somewhere that's not infested with [rednecks]
