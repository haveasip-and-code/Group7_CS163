The Curl
A superhero. ; Otherwise known as Lauren. The most awesome curly haired mofo I've everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr met. (period) ; There was this one time, in grade 3, when our dear friend was visited by her monthly visitor. She was sitting quietly in english class when all of the sudden she felt a surge. Her face became quite distressed and she looked to me, her dear friend for help. I laughed. She continued to ask another friend for her sweater, which she then tied around waist. Our other friend didn't know the seater was going to be used for period purposes. Hence it becoming gross and disfigured and multiple youngin's crying. ; Long story short, THE CURL OWNS YOU ALL.
