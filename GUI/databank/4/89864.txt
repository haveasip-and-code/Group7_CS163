lax-balls
originated from me when i walked out of the locker room to show everybody in the hallway my new all-[shibby] money stick (that's a diamond-pro shaft if you didn't know) and got nailed in the left testicle with a lacrosse ball (thrown by my good friend, the goalie, Mike 'I-dont-know-how-to-spell-his-last-name' Moinihan) My left testicle is still bruised and looks quite shrivled... faive day later... ; basically what you need to know is that lax-balls (both the hard rubber ones w/ lead cores, and the condition of having your testes popped by a hard rubber ball w/ a lead core) hurt... alot... really... When you play [lacrosse]... WEAR A CUP!
