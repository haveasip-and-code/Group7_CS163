Lincoln Continental
1. A pimp/ette's vehicle, designed for the most comfortable fuck achievable. (I know..) First produced in 1938, 1956-60 the Mark II-V were released under solely the 'Continental' name, in 1961 the Continental was completely redesigned from scratch. 60's models were often characterized by suicide doors, a design flaw that makes for an extremely sexy, deadly vehicle. The accelerator must be pressed with a pimp cane, and there are dual goblet holders for you & your hoe passenger's drinking pleasure.
