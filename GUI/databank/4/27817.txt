Lincoln Park Royalty
'Lincoln Park' refers to the centrally located public high school in Chicago. The 'Royalty' (as they are known) attend the school as members of the class of 2006. Lincoln Park Royalty (or LPR) consits of four highly devious teenage girls. Apart from being highly good looking and highly intelligent (if they do say so themselves), LPR is an undercover organization responsible for the majority of the nonviolent havoc-wreaking and trouble-making bestowed upon their poorly administrated school.
