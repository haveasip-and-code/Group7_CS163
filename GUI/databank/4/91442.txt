Mace
The antidote to the chronic condition of 'Abzism' - a debilitating disease where your mouth gets slowly replaced by a bull's arsehole over years of just being Abz. Presence of a Mace means that Abzism in the affected patient will eventually disintegrate to the realisation that the defective gene 'Abz' is nothing more than a big pink softy.
