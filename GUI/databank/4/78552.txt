mongoloid feet
Used when describing someone with ridiculously large and often times dirty feet. A true mongoloid footer has a huge and very long big toe in which many diseases may occur such as gangrene. People with monogoloid feet have very low self esteem and often think you are judging them when describing their feet. When in actuality, you are just pointing out that they need to wash those fucking things with some type of chemical so they look sort of normal. For short the word 'mongs' could be used to describe this horrible disease.
