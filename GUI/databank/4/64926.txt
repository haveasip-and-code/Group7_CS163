Spiderman
An addendum to the method of performing the Spiderman below. When completing the Spiderman (flinging the 'web' into the girl's face), you must make the appropriate Spiderman hand gesture AND voice Spidey's famous web noise - THWIPP! Immediately web swinging away is recommended (for added effect throw in a Spidey catch phrase or witicism).
