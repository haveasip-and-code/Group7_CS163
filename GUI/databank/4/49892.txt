Inuyasha fan
The most intelligent anime fans with the best taste in anime. We love this show Inuyasha, and true Inuyasha fans don't watch the crappy dubbed version on AS (as some idiots seem to think). The dubbed butchered the show completely. We only watch the subbed version, and I bet most of these haters have never even seen the Shichinintai arc. Anyway, Inuyasha is the best anime ever.
