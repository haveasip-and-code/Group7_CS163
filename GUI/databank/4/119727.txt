Subeta
A virtual pet website that stole the ideas for every aspect of its site from [Neopets]. ; The [admins] on this site are apparently 'approachable' and 'actually able to be talked to.' This translates into, the only way to succeed on Subeta is to get friendly with the admins. The only people the admins care about though, are those who donate money (5$ each month) to have 'gold accounts' with which they can take advantage of all the features that make it impossible for normal users who value their money to do anything. ; A website to entertain fools who enjoy parting with their money in exchange for 'cute' pixel images.
