gridlock
v. ; The feminized cock block (a.k.a. Blocking the Box). The origin of this term comes from city traffic signs ('Don't Block the Box') in order to alleviate rush hour traffic conditions where cars are stopped in the middle of an intersection. In these situations, blocking the box inevitably results in gridlock.
