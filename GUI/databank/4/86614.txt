Nerds 4 Life
The elite group of nerds who no one shalt surpass. Membership includes only the nerdiest of the nerds, making it a swizztastic club...yea, no big deal. True members include those who hit on seventh grade girls, can recite many digits of pi of the top of their head, dont dance but hump, and most importantly have sweet nerd voices. (abreviated N4L)
