Stand
An amazing band from Ireland, based in New York, that has an incredibly unique, contrasting, complex, and yet simplistic sound that is none like any other band. Although they do not have a record label, they continually mold and shape the music scene of New York City with their cutting (and top of the line) live preformances. With previous albums such as: Beautiful Grey (day?), Correspondant, and their new Transmissions,the Irish lads have continually to build on a new sound which they have played with for a long time, and will no doubt bring them places. www.standland.com
