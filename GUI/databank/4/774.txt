Arizona
Excruciatingly hot in places like Phoenix and Tucson, especially if you are from Flagstaff. Whenever you are in a different region and someone asks where you are from, their automatic response is 'wow, it must be hot huh?' Well it's NOT hot if you live in NORTHERN Arizona! We have four seasons and it snows a lot up here! People come up here to SKI. There is a lot more to AZ than people think.
