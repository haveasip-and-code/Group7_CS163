angel of death
when a person leans down and takes lot of deep breaths then they take a deep breath in and hold it in, lean upright against a wall and crodd their arms over their chest, each hand touching the opposite shoulder (this is to be done quickly) they keep the breath in during this. then people quickly push as hard as they can on the persons chest (their arm still there) this causes the person to pass out, but this can kill people and causes brain tumors DONT DO IT! ; it realy does work!
