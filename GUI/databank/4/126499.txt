bah-bah
A strange term of endearment used between goofy [Blacktino] men & small Hot-Topic shoppin' Philippino women. It is meant to mimick the noise a sheep makes (as in 'Bah-Bah [black sheep], have you any wool'). Needless to say, this is probably not a term many people will ever have use for... But hey, knowledge is power, right?
