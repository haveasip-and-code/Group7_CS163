the best response to any question. can be used on numerous occasions including insulting someone, an answer to a question you dont know the answer for, just for the hell of it or in concjuntion with a sentence. NB: it is important to find out about the status of the other person mother i.e. if something upsetting happened to her etc so no true insult is caused. P.S. the only people who WILL get really insulted then are silly or stupid and dont understand it is a joke and think you are really out to insult their family...
