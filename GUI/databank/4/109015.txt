A project put together involving some of Daves favoured artists, him coming up with the fantastic idea that they should all play together and create an awesome sounding album. Unfortunatley the final result sounds, well shit. Theres no real sense of direction, and most of the songs just sound like the crazed jammings of a bunched of rocked out herroin addicts, oh wait....
