Libertyville
A Chicago suburb, comparable to the classic [north shore] suburbs, just not directly on the lake. Characterized by new money and an amazing high school football team, Libertyville provides for an excellent, although typical, upper-middle class lifestyle. When in the town, one will notice a cute yet quaint historical downtown area, as well as an abundance of car dealerships. Affectionately called L-ville by those who live there.
