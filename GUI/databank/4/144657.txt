General studies
Most 16-18 year olds in the UK are forced to take this subject, but it isn't recognized by a lot of universities due to its incredible easiness (from personal experience, it is possible to get 93% without attending a single class, revising or even knowing what the exam is about). Serves to crush the confidence of students everywhere as they learn how to: ; Read newspapers ; Find the areas of surfaces ; Form social opinions ; Re-enforce work done two years ago for subjects which hold no interest ; Also a nice source of income for examining boards.
