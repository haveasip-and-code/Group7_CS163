LS1
A V8 built by General Motors. Ricers call it old-fashioned because it is a pushrod engine, however, they completely ignore the coil-per-cylinder distributorless ignition, plastic intake manifold, and aluminum block and cylinder head. ; This engine was found in all Corvettes built from 1997 to 2001, and in all 2004 Pontiac GTOs. ; It has evn higher performing variants, like the LS6 which features a more aggressive camshaft profile and higher flowing ports, the LS2 which displaces 6.0L and has displacement on demand, and the LS7 which is 7.0L in size and features CNC ported cylindr heads.
