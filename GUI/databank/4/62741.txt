Cville
Cockeysville, Maryland is a tranquile suburb of the bustling towson metropolis. The sport of choice and a long time maryland pastime is lax. Usually if you are not a laxer and attending the array of public elementary schools or cockeysville middle you will get made fun of. However the rapid depletion of the caucasion folk has be coupled with the rise in the ESOL(english as a second language), and the installment of section 8 housing. There are some various 'hang outs' where kids chill. They are rather unbeat and consist of Ritas, Snoaisis, 'ballin' at springdale or warren, and most def. laxin at any local net. There is however a downfall to the pristine, and that is the apartments next to the local McDonalds where it is rumored to have numerous drug busts. I hope for the childrens sake that this is a falacy, but if not it is really beat. One thing to always remember is Cville is always on my mind.
