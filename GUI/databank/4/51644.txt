Slang for 20', 22', 24', & 26' common-size rims. 20'-22' rims most preferred on full size cars, mainly 'ghetto-beaters' or a low-budget vehicle with wheel modifications. These are commonly older luxury vehicles consisting of 1980's-1990's Era Oldsmobile Delta 88's, Cadillac DeVilles, Chevrolet Impalas, and many more models. As for 22' and above rims are the higher class, more expensive source of style. Most of these styles are preferred on a Cadillac Escalade, Lincoln Navigator, or any other kind of luxury sports utility vehicle. A newer style of rims, 'Spinners', commonly called are large upper-scale rims with a ball bearing type of action, with what appears to be another fascia attachment. It uses very little friction and are usually manufactured with near-perfect balance. These use centrifugal force to continue spinning, even after braking to a complete stop. This may be attractive to many urban crowds.
