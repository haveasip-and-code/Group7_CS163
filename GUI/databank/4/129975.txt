crappic
The worst possible traffic you can be in. The kind that plagues major metropolitan areas during rush hour, or occurs behind an accident. You replace the 't' in traffic with a 'c' and the 'ff' with a 'pp' - you get crappic. Crappic doesn't need a modifier. There's no such thing as bad crappic. if it's that bad, it's crappic . . . if it isn't that bad, it's just traffic.
