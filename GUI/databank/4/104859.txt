toad sexing
Yes it is endemic at MIT. Yes there is an explanation. According ; to Jerry Letvin, serveral years ago in his comparative psysiology ; class he explained how one sexes a toad. It seems that if you ; squeeze a male toad just behind the front legs, he will croak. A ; female will not. Thus a toad in a pond in the middle of the night ; can determine whether the other toad next to him is an ; appropriate subject of his amorous attentions by climbing on and ; listening. Apparently, it became semi-popular amongst some MIT ; students to sheak up on each other & poke from both sides just ; under the arms. Thus 'no toad sexing'.
