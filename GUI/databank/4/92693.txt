hype
1. Very excited for something. This connotation requires that the word hype be followed by the word 'for'. Using 'all' before the word hype accentuates the amount of excitement. ; 2. Very angry or upset at something. This connotation requires that the word hype be followed by the word 'at.' If neither 'at' or 'for' is used, the second definition is implied. Again, using 'all' before the word hype accentuates the amount of anger.
