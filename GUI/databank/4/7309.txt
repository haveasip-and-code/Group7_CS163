C-Bizkit
the word C-Bizkit was derived from the name craig, to form a word describing a fat, oppinionated hippy who worships a man named jim and often invents annoying phrases such as 'your mom's a quiche face' or 'some one's got sand in his vagina' and insists them on throwing them in at random points in all of his (or her) conversations.
