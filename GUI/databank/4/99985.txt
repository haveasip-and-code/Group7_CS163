brasher
The home of the hicks. There is no civilization there. Also home of my boyfriend, and my best friend's boyfriend. There are no paved roads, nor cars, and you can't see your neighbors, because they're all 30 miles apart. The most popular transportation systems are tractors, but those are expensive, horse and buggy, or fourwheelers but only the rich citizens of Brasher have those. Other names for Brasher are, the bush, the boonies, the woods, the backwoods, the outback, or hickville.
