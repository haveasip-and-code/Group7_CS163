Pikey
What is now know as a fucking Chav. Chav is such a crap word. Pikeys have been round for ages. When I was growing up it was Reebok Classics and Ben Sherman. Nowadays its Burberry. Anyway, Burberry caps went out of fashion 3 years ago, anyone going to garage/drum n bass raves can tell you that. After Burberry caps came those really tight nike caps that every single little cunt in Fabric would wear. Now its them Dizzee Rascal baseball caps with the flat peak. In my area, rounf West London, a pikey/chav was called a 'Dave'. Same thing, classics, ben sherman, jewellery, bad attitude, short hair gelled forward, usually acne problem, talks like a cockney gangster. Like a male version of Shazzers and Tracies.
