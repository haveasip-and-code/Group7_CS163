ONDCP
The ONDCP, or Office of National Drug Control Policy, is a [hate] group and [propaganda] organization similar to the [PDFA], except that it is a part of the U.S. government and thus gets massive taxpayer funding. They advocate the same things as the PDFA, including the parenting tactic of spying on your kids. There is so much similarity between the PDFA and the ONDCP that there are very few people alive who can tell the difference anymore. I am not one of these people; thus anything on the PDFA page is probably true of the ONDCP as well (and not necessarily true of the PDFA, but probably). They are part of the [Church of Voodoo Pharmacology], the same cult as the [PDFA] and [DEA].
