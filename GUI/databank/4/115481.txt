Mr. Wednesday
One who is always is tring to be in the MIDDLE of everything. i.e. conversation, events, etc... ; One who is sticks their nose in every one elses buisness. ; This comes from the days of the week. Wednesday falls in the MIDDLE of the week. Right in the middle, Just like a Mr.Wednesday always in the Middle
