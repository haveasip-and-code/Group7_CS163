Mr. Anonymous Trojan, check out the second page of UCLA definitions. You'll find that a lot of your buddies from USC were making overly negative, hateful definitions about UCLA before Trojankiller posted his definitions. And unlike most of the asinine comments your buddies made, his definitions are filled with 'facts' about UCLA's academic and athletic prestige. ; Don't get your panties into a bunch because UCLA students don't just lie down for your abuse. If you want to give it, you better learn to take it. It's also ironic that you can criticize someone for using the internet while you're doing the same thing. Insecure much?
