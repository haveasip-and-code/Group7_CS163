Squabble Snake
1. A girl of alarmingly small stature; she is always short and, in practically every case very skinny as well. ; Not only does she have these inadmirable traits but, in addition, she always acts fiesty and quite often is an annoying bitch. ; Maret School President, and perhaps the most respected man when it comes to these matters, [woo], recently expressed his sentiments on squabble snakes in an interview with Time Magazine, stating 'when i see a squabble snake i usually like to keep my distance, however, when they are extra annoying, i sometimes need to act out of character a little bit and tear their clothing off and inflict pain.'
