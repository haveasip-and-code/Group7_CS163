VR4
A limited edition import made by Japanese Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. The car was supposed to be Mitsubishis flagship entry into US market it had STANDARD equipment of 4ws (Four Wheel Steering, comething 99% of the cars STILL dont have, 4WD, ABS, turbocharged 2.0l engine, all leather interior, tons of little quirks, like dashboard that could change lights...). Only 3000 were ever imported into US. Most of the current owners of this vehicle tend to be severly anti 'rice' and any sort of non engine mod is severily frowned upon by the VR4 community.
