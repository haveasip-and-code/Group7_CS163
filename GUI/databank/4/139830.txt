south brunswick
commonly referred to as 'mouth' brunswick because everyone is so far up eachothers' asses and know everything about everyone else. Mind you- graduating classes of about 500, where you know shit about just about everyone, except for the Indians, which more often then not, are in their own cliques. A town where rich/middle class suburbia meets the nastiness of the trailer park and the black girls are nasty in the hallways. When asked where south brunswick is- a common answer would be, by Rutgers, and although you say you would never go there, chances are you will because you got rejected from TCNJ. Everyone who lives in SB can't wait til grad day to get the fuck out. The cops are also notorious for catching people hotboxing their cars, which really sucks. People also tend to start drinking, smoking and having sex quite early as well- o well, we are all fucked up. Even though we all hate SB, we become obsessed with it once we leave. This is a town full of elite douchebaggery, and most people end up missing it.
