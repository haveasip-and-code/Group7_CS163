UPS employee.
One who is employed by the UPS company. They have T-shirts which say on the front 'UPS employee,' and the back of the shirt reads, 'commited to excellence.' Which is a blanant display of UPS over hyping their customer service. If this individual were truly commited to excellence he probably wouldn't have wound up in the packaging industry. It would be fine if the back of a shirt said 'commited to excellence' if the front said something like 'olympian' or 'I build rockets.' But 'UPS employee' should have something more appropriate on the back, like, 'G.E.D'
