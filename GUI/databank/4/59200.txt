Dora the explorer
Literally an insult to ANYONE'S intelligence. This isn't for pre-schoolers, this is for people in comas. The show includes an annoying Spanish girl that constantly does dangerous, stupid shit and has parents that apparently approve of said dangerous, stupid shit. Way to teach the kids, asshole. Then, as if they haven't been stupifying us enough with their inane bullshit, they ask the most obvious questions, and (in case you are blind or dead) point them out in the most obvious manner. For example, Dora asks 'Where is Benny the Bull's farm?' Suddenly, the camera pans the the side until there is nothing left BUT the barn. Then, a tornado comes down to draw your attention to the spot where the barn is, while a giant flashing arrow points directly at it. And then, as if we (or the children, or whatever) were to dumb to find it, a shitty blue cursor 'beats us to the punch' as the little bitch mockingly congratulates us on a job well done. Fuck you, you little shit! Also, Dora travels along with a gay little monkey (no offense intended, I'm just pointing out he's gay) that is literally incapable of anything but whinning and bitching the entire fucking show. Then, at least once a show, they run into the residental badass, Swiper the fox, who steal items from them and conviniently tosses them into a pile of similar items - that is, unless Dora, Boots and of course, you utter out the phrase 'Swiper, don't swipe it' three times, which causes the sneaky fox to snap his fingers mafia-style and run away like a pussy. Wow, a real gangsta, that one. If I was Swiper, I'd bite Dora's tits of and shove them down Boot's mouth. Then I'd break my own neck on a tree for being such a pansy. What a shit show.
