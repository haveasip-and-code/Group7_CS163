totes
A synonym for breasts. The word is derived from its similarity to tits and the fact that tote bags are about the size of the average breast, therefore the word tote has come to mean tit. It is especially useful in mixed company where a male may comment she has nice totes, without the well-endowed woman knowing that she is being discussed.
