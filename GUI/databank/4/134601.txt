SRCJ
An acronym, pronounced SURK-jah, which stands for 'socially retarded computer junky'. ; This term is used to describe an individual who is inept in social situations and has a penchant for certain nerdy activities while expressing complete disinterest in other stereotypically geeky pursuits. In addition to being socially inept, this type of individual is addicted to computers and the internet and yet is not interested in console games, cartoons, or science fiction. ; If you took 'The True Geek Test' by Nick Ross and were classified as 'The Simple Geek', then you are most likely a SRCJ.
