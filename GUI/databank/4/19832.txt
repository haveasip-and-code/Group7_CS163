Income Support
Money given to people without work that DO posess a house. This therefore means tramps are NOT on income support. It is meant to be spent on food and clothing, but an ACTUAL SIENTIFIC STUDY shows that 73% of people on income support buy cigerettes. (No offence if you don't!) ; NB) NO offence was meant with this definition.
