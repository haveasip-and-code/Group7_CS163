RE
A complete and utter waste of time. Unfortunate school children will spend many hours being forced to study the many religions of the world; pouring through incomprehensible and frequently contradictory religious texts eventually coming to the conclusion that there is no difference between religion except the name of the deity they worship. ; Pity those foolish enough to choose it as a GCSE or A-Level option. For they will be 'fortunate' enough to discuss the existence of God in unnecessary depth week after week after week. It's funny how the RE teacher always states that the argument is undecided despite the overwhelming evidence against it and the lack of evidence for it in the form of antiquated, rudimentary philosophical ideas (Aquinas and Paley spring to mind). ; Worse still if you have an unpleasant God boy lecturing you. Particularly if he is some effeminate Irish cretin who's arrogance and pubescent mood swings are inflicted upon you on a weekly basis.
