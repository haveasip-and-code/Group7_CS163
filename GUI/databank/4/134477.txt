Chris Cuthbert
Play-by-play sports commentator for [CBC] from 1984-2005. Often called the action for [NHL] and [CFL] games. NO RELATION to [Elisha Cuthbert] by any stretch of the imagination. Often known for his extremely lame dorky comments on the air (which may explain why [CBC] fired him...either that or because of the 2004/2005 NHL lock out). ; Cuthbert now works for TSN where he still entertains fans with his lame annoying comments during [NHL] and [CFL] games. He's a bit biased for a play-by-play guy (especially when the [Toronto Maple Leafs] are playing) but he is still a respectable broadcaster with years of experience.
