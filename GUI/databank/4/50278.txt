MS-13
MS13 is the most brutal gang in America. It has many members and is spreading like wild-fire across America. MS-13 stands for Mara Salvatrucha which is Spanish for 'Street Tough Salvadoran Posse'. The number 13 is synonomous with any Latino gang. The process for initian requires the inductee to undergo 13 seconds of beat down (the inductee is not allowed to protect himself in any way).
