immigrant
(supposed to mean those coming into a country) but is now known to be the millions of Iraqi, Czech, Portugese etc men that come into England supposedly for work, rely solely on benefits, but somehow manage to buy every brand/designer name on the planet. They hang around in shopping centres and city centres eyeing up young girls, whistling and often attempting to pervertedly communicate with said young girls. They all have the same haircut too.
