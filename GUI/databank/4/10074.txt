Aussie Rules
The best sport in the world - combines skill with strength, not just one or the other. Shits all over American football and to some extent, soccer where pussy footing about is considered a talent. Best players: Chris Judd, Ben Cousins and some other boof heads from other clubs ;o) ; AFL 4eva!
