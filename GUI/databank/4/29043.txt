Led zeppelin
Led zeppelin is an english band from the late 60's to 1980. they are the greatest band ever, because they could play any style of music, and use any instuments in their music, and make it sound completely awesome. Weather it's the haunting 'battle of evermore', the rocking 'Black Dog', the musical orgasm also known as 'stairway to heaven', the epic 'achillies last stand', the driving and upbeat 'trampled under foot' the middle eastern 'Kashmir, the sad, somber 'all of my love', or the electrical 'the ocean', or their blues cover of 'when the levee breaks. Led zeppelin showed that they could play any sort of music. With Jimmy page playing the guitar like no one else could, John bonham's drumming that gave him the nickname 'god of thunder', robert Plant's amazing voice that could go from screaming like a banshee to haunting ghost like in no time, and John paul Jones with his deadly keyboard and bass (also the recorder on stairway to heaven). No band can ever lick the balls of led zeppelin, let alone be compared to them. often hated by [preps], [jocks] becuase [MTV] doesn't think they're cool.
