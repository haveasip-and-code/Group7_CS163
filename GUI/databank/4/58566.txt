deep sea dive
Refers to the idea of holding one's breath while under water. Usually takes place when a woman goes down on a male (or even if a male goes down on male). While she is diving, the receiver simply pinches the nose of the one doing the job. This usually leads to lack of oxygen, purple faces, and good laughs with your bouddies.
