Gray Collar Workers
A Gray Collar Worker is a member of the service class. While a blue collar worker is a proletarian and primarily manual labour worker (such as a factory worker), and a white collar worker is a bourgeoisie class member (a lawyer). ; The Gray Collar Working class does not have the riches of the white collar workers, nor the pride, nor unity of a blue collar worker. ; The greatest work on Gray Collar Workers is in the film 'Fight Club.' It describes the lack of self-confidence, feeling of no masculinity, and the feeling of incompetence with near perfection.
