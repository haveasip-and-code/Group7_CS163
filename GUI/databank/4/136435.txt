cordwangler
A type of cheese referenced in 'Bagenders', a popular AU Lord of the Rings fan fiction, that sadly is no longer updated. The full name of the cheese is 'Old Cordwangler's Extra Blue Fantastically Mature'. ; The flavour and smell are supposed to be so violently strong that the cheese has actually taken on the ability to move, and attacks those who are near it. ; It it used as a gimmick in Season 2, Episode 3, 'The Dream Fridge' when Boromir posesses the fellowship's fridge and they are attempting different ways to excorcise him. Link to the story: http://tinyurl.com/9n8wp ; It now basically just refers to a very smelly cheese.
