Harrison N.J.
Small urban town sandwiched between Newark and NYC. 'The Beehive of Industry'. Known for Frank E. Rodgers, the longest serving mayor in American history. Known for soccer, where Harrison High School owns 21 state championships, most in state history. Hates Kearny, hates North Arlington. Very diverse. New home of the NY/NJ MetroStars. Filming site of the Sopranos. Home of Ray Lucas (who played for the NY Jets, New England, Baltimore, and Miami of the NFL) and Daisy Fuentes. Used to have the most bars per square mile. Possibly the weirdest HS mascot: Blue Tide.
