holy cross girl
Holy Cross is an all-girls school located in Kensington, Maryland. Although Holy Cross girls pride themselves on the diversity of their school, racial groups at AHC are totally segregated. Basically, if you're white, don't expect to be friends with much more than white girls. AHC is famous for its over-acceptance, with class sizes way above the size of the building (even with the new addition and the theatre that fits 400). Holy Cross girls can be very open, but lots of them missed the memo that 6th grade is over. They tend to take part in feuds that last years and can be resolved in a 20-year reunion catfight. Girls, don't mess with them, because they'll most likely slip something in your drink...that will kill you. Guys, steer clear. They want to marry you. And fast.
