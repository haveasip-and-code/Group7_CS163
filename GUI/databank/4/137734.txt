Philosopher's stone
A mythical stone which [alchemy] practically revolves around. It was desired by a lot of entrepreneurs (see [suckers]) in the dark ages because of its promise to turn ordinary materials like coal into gold. Naturally, all of those who sought the stone practiced alchemy, and not surprisingly they came up empty-handed.
