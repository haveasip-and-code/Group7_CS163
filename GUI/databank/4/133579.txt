Feti
A teenager who is pre-occupied with trivial things such as material posessions, celebrities, the opposite sex, and current fads and fashions. They usually have a low literacy rate, and little to no self-respect or respect of others. They may or may not smoke, and many feti remain feti long into adulthood.
