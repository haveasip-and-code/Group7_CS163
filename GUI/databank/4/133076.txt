american university
A college in North-West Washington, DC. Known for its excessive political vibe. Students here like to: ; 1.) Go to TDR and complain how much they hate it, yet continue to go there. ; 2.) Drunkenly order food from Cafe Romeo's, any chinese food (for some reason all the chinese food in DC tastes the same), or if it's a weekday go to the Eagles Nest (Which is always blaring the best music with its workers and customers dancing). ; 3.) Complain about how much they hate the library. ; 4.)Girls like to complain about how all the good guys are gay. ; 5.) Guys like to complain about how all the girls are ugly. ; 6.) Smoke shit loads of cigarettes in LA quad. ; 7.) Talk endlessly about shit that doesn't matter, while alienating people that have no interest in their conversation. ; 8.) Live in the berks, which is like the dorms, except the dorms are nicer.
