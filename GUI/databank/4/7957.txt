Hyper-Sensitive
Used to describe one who is overly concerned with others' opinions regarding him/her. Hyper-sensitive people usually worry that anything someone else says/does expresses dislike for them. In fact, a hyper-sensitive person is so obsessed with others' thoughts that it eats at him/her internally, leading to the person's inability to focus on anything but others' opinions.
