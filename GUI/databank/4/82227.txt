Scrotor
The scrotor is a miserable and pitied creature. It is not liked by anyone and the scariest part is there may be more than one. The scrotor can be easily identified by it's love for flexing. The scrotor takes off it's shirt and flexes with one arm when it is scared, sad, happy, lonely or bored.
