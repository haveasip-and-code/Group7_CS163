The Ganbot
Eric Litvak is The Ganbot. ; Derivation: The year is 2001. The place is Storrs 416. Kyle Carver said Gan and in worse cases, Ganbot, to express dismay at koreans playing Everquest. Gan became a staple of the vocabulary of the residents of Storrs 416-420 quad and later effused to the residents of the 2nd floor of Alumni. The word wasn't just used; it was overused. It was understood. It became a concept more than an expression... a myth of a fallen soldier remembered eternally. Yes.
