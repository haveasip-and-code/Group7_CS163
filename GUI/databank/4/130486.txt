sloblocks
Word thought to have been invented by British comedian Stephen Fry, in a comedy sketch parodising the British game show Countdown, where he used that word as the conundrum. The presenter of Countdown, the late Richard Whiteley, said that Sloblocks was his favourite swear word in an unaired promotion for Channel 4. It could be used as a substitute for 'bollocks'.
