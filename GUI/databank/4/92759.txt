Leeroy
Started a online fad of epic proportions. Just when you thought Numa Numa Dance was big, a World of Warcraft guild makes a video *staged or not dosent matter* that made everyone laugh. The video has a group ; raiding some place and the guild is planing raid this one room that gave them probs in the past. As the raid is about to start a player in the group by the name 'Leeroy' jumps up says his name and causes tons of monsters to kill his group. After everyone is dead and everyone is pissed at Leeroy he respons with the epic words 'Atlest I have chicken.' ; Leeroy Jinkins in doing so became a internet star, but at the cost of never being able to play as Jeeroy again, being people will flood him with PM's and mail.
