chanchero
A D.C metropolitan area term used to describe wetbacks latinos or people (from central or south america) that dress out of fashion, acts really uncivilized with respect to the american customs and traditions. They tend to like ranchera or boleros musics; dress in baggy unbranded clothes (such as paco) or dress as mexican vaqueros; and vulgarly attempt to flirt with a girl. Finally, they tend to be in clustered cities and linger in groups of the same. Also they act 'ghetto' in public. ; Chancheros tries to act like the americans of the United States youth, even if they are older.
