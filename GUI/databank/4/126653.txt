kid a
Radiohead's album Kid A is a treat for the ears and the mind. Think of it this way: listening to the album is like working out, if you haven't done something similar to it (in the album's case I mean listening to different kinds of music), it might be hard to get into it but once you do get into it, it is rewarding. Believe me, invest your time on listening to this album. I fell in love with this album initially while doing my homework and listening to it because like most people I was just used to listening to [shitty]popular music, so I just couldn't give it my undivided attention. However, the album grew on me and when I look back on it, this tiny disc, is one of the greatest things I own.
