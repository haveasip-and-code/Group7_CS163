Bloods
A gang that formed in the late 70's out of many sets that were bullied by the crips. The sets met on Piru Street and formed the Blood alliance. Although the Bloods are outnumbered 5 to 1 in LA County, Blood sets are always more violent, especially when present in numbers. Blood members have developed a strong love and fascination for Assault weapons.
