Halloweenie
A person who loves Halloween above all holidays. Halloween is their Christmas, Easter, Valentines and St.Patrick's day all-in-one. Of course this person probably dresses mostly in black, could be kinda scary themselves until you get to know them, makes cool props, decorates their yard and home like a haunted house and has no problem coming up with the most creative and original costumes ever to show up at a party. ; (Definitely an interesting person to know in my humble opinion!!)
