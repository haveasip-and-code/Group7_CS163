Kanata
A small city of about 45000 people. Lacks culture and diversity. Inhabited almost exclusively by yuppies and middle-class tech geeks. Every housewife drives a massive SUV, which of course not a single one of them can park properly. The teenagers are desperate for attention, worthwhile activities, or excitement. Overall Kanata is pretty homogenious, not in colour, but in attitude. For example, there is a small African-Canadian minoirty in Kanata but they act, dress and speak like the rest of the suburbanite drones. Avoid Kanata, it took me 22 yeahs to extricate myself from that mindless dungheap.
