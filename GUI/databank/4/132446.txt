TDC
Totally Dumb Crew. The coolest Algebra 2 group that really means Tammy, Dijamco, Crhstian. They randomly represent random countries. From the 'PHILIPPINES!' to !BEIJING(BEIII-JANG!)' even to !AFRICA! YOU KNOW!' While on the court you can hear T yelling the F word, or D getting an A in Algebra 2, and C going dumb to Gangsta music. TDC is where it's at!
