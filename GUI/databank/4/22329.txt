Uilleann pipes
The Uilleann pipes are the type of bagpipes native to Ireland. Unlike the Highland Bagpipes native to Scotland, the Uilleann pipes are played sitting down and are nowhere near as loud. They are meant for indoor playing, and are about as loud as a fiddle. They are used most in traditional celtic music. They are much more of an intimate insturment then the Great Highland pipes.
