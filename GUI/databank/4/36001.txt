advil
Brand name for Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drug. Works by blocking the enzyme cyclooxygenase , which is responsible for the production of prostaglandins (an inflammatory molecule) through the arachadonic acid cascade. Although sold as a racemic mixture, the (S) isomer is most effective, although the (R) isomer is converted to the (S) isomer in the body and used. Used for the relief of minor pain, has the typical list of side effects which may actually be worse then the minor pain you took it to relieve. Works well to alleviate hangovers if taken before going to sleep, slightly less risky to the liver then Tylenol.
