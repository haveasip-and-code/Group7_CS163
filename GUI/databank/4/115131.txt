tim tam slam
This is the act of using a [tim tam] biscuit to drink tea, by biting off to opposite corners and then using it as a straw to suck up hot tea. ; Note that the structural integrity of the tim tam will become catastrophically reduced soon after this process is started, and the whole biscuit must be crammed into your mouth as soon as this happens, lest your tea will be filled with pieces of melted tim tam.
