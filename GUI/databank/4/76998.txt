United States of the Offended
A term devised by Robert D. Raiford, curmudgeon-at-large, and the only REAL reason to listen to the John Boy and Billy show. It's what the good ol' U.S. of A have become thanks to the panty-waisted touchy-feely liberal types who go out of their way looking for something to offend them, and get said panties in a knot when they find it. Hey, it's called the right to freedom of speech, ya horse's ass. Go check out the first ammendment. NOWHERE does it say that you have the right not to be offended. So quit calling for more tolerance and diversity training, and just learn to deal with it. Instead of trying to make us all overly sensitive, why the hell don't you go out and get a real job, and mind your own damn business. Sometimes the truth's a bitch, fuckers.
