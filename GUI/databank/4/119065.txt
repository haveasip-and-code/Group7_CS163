drum major
Person that conducts a Marching Band of sorts. This highly regarded individual is thought of as keeping the band together as they perform for an audience, when in reality, about 95% of the band is listening to the [drumline] who are in fact the true conductors of a band. If the band and the drumline are not together in the music everything thing will in short, go to hell. Hence, no one is really watching the drum major as they perform because as we all know, they lack the basic music fundamentals of tempo and time once they step up onto their pedestal.
