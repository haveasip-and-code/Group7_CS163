RP
N. ; Short for Role Play, where people act out actions and events. This is most common on forums, especially with gaming forums where people act out characters from the game or RP in the game's universe. There's simple and narrative RP. Simple has rpers where events and actions are described basically and quickly. This mode allows for developed storylines, conversation, and cooperation. Though simple is usually looked down upon as degenerat and only belonging to [n00b]s. Narrative has players acting out actions and events very descriptively and often seem like pages from well written novels. Narratives are easy to screw up, allow for no or very little cooperation, and don't have much conversation. But narrative does allow for great fight RPs. ; V. ; To role play as in an RP.
