Odyssey 5
The best Sci-Fi show ever made. So of course, it's been canceled. At the moment, there are probably a dozen geeks who want to disagree with me. I'm not saying you're wrong but just watch the show then come back and tell me what you think. If you get the chance write Showtime and ask for it back....they'll probaly just tell you to fuck off and go watch Queer As Folk though.
