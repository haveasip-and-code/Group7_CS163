Jewish overdrive
To save gas by putting your car into neutral (or depressing the clutch) and turning off the ignition. ; CAUTION: When driving a carbureted car down a long hill in Jewish overdrive, do not let out the clutch with the car in gear, then later turn on the ignition. If you do this, the engine will backfire. The longer you go before turning on the ignition, the more violent the backfire. Unless you're running glasspack mufflers, you can blow off your exhaust system. ; Compare to [Okie overdrive].
