fuck the goat
It's a term when somebody does something stupid -- like fucking a goat -- and they are never known for anything else but the 'goat fucking' incident. Even if the person solved world peace, they would always be known as a goat fucker. It's similar to the term 'jump the shark,' where a tv show takes that leap into obscurity. Does everybody 'fuck the goat' and ruin their reputation? No, so it's all up to the individual to make the right choice.
