hopesfall
A band that used to be really good, but then decided to go the way of making radio-friendly rock/emo songs with their new cd 'A Types'. Before A Types was relased, it could be argued that hopesfall was invariably one of the most unique bands in hardcore. Now they've gone the way of [Underoath], [Hawthorne Heights], [The Ataris], etc, basically any shitty band you can think of that has their shirts hanging at [hot topic].
