spadionkle
Orginates from the flick 'Cannibal the Musical' starring Matt Stone and directed by Trey Parker (South Park, Baseketball, Team America: World Police). ; The term spadionkle expresses supreme joy and happiness; an all out 'good' feeling; the warm fuzzies, not the cold priklies. Complete euphoria.
