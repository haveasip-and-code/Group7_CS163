Creedmoor
A small bedroom town outside of Raliegh, North Carolina. It is a great place to be from, the keyword being from. Half the population has lived there for generations, the other half moved from elsewhere. The half that's lived there for generations are degenerate rednecks that spend their time cruising the Food Lion parking Lot in wanna be ricer cars. The other half, the intelligent portion, go to Raliegh for entertainment and work, they simply sleep in Creedmoor. It is still a relatively quiet town, with overpopulated schools, but beware the 'Pink Shirt Gang' and 'White Shirt Gang' which allegedly cause trouble in the community and schools. ; Many of the students within the schools who are second+ generation students (the degenerate rednecks) are racist and hate black people but prefer to listen to rap, and where urban apparel. Many of the black students are either poser thugs, or black rednecks. There is a minimal hispanic population, most of which is illegal and works in the Tobacco fields.
