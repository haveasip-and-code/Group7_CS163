flavor berry
The flavor berry, also known as the wonder fruit, is an endemic species native to a single small island on the southern coast of Chile. That island is nestled safely in a labyrinth of fjords, canals, inlets, islands and twisting peninsulas. ; The existence of the flavor berry on this otherwise barren island has baffled scientists much in the same way as the plants and animals of Galapagos Islands. Even more baffling is the nature of the fruit. The flavor berry contains proteins made up of complex amino acids not found in any other fruit. This makes study of the flavor berry very difficult, as its structure deteriorates very quickly once it is picked. Consequently, flavor berries are not sold, even on the mainland of Chile. ; Flavor berries come in a range of colors, from a deep, vibrant red to a deep, vibrant purple. The flesh of the flavor berry is extremely sweet has a very pungent odor. However, some question whether the flavor berry is edible, as it contains trace amounts of several mind-altering chemicals, such as lysergic acid, the chemical found in LSD, and Salvinorin-A. ; Nutritionally, the flavor berry is a complete food. It contains ample amounts of several vitamins, such as: Vitamin A, the essential B Vitamins (B6, B12), Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Pantothenic acid (B5), Thiamin (B1), Riboflavin (B2), and Vitamin E. It also contains certain minerals, such as calcium and iron.
