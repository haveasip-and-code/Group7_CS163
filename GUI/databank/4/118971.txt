cedar water
A type of poop-brown water found in the Tuckahoe river. It houses the world's most disgusting creatures, including rattle snakes and aqua zombies who live on the bottom of the river and breath water. Most people who live near cedar water are hicks with shotguns. When you jump in cedar water it gets in your nose and many are known to cough it up for hours afterwards. It pretty much looks like iced tea. The zombies can be brought to life by listening to Phish and looking up cedar water on the internet on urban dictionary.
