flagpole
the act of sitting backwards on a toilet and defecating. this is done so that the poop will get stuck on the side of the bowl, not falling into the water. if done properly (much harder than it sounds) the poop will remain even after a flush. this is done to people/places you dont like (eg school) usually by teenage boys.
