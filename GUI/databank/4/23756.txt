Mchussy
Mc + hussy. It doesn't nessesarily mean what it is, and yet most of the time it does... by all means start calling everyone mchussies.haha ; Why the Mc you ask? well Mc makes everything sound better and funnier. ; also use the word [borange], just because you can. ; You can thank yas for this brilliant word, and stu from eskimo joe, who likes to call people hussies.<3
