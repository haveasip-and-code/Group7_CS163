emo love
emo love is when both [emo girl] and [emo boy] (some times same sex)think that there loving relationship will last for ever and think that the foundations of there relation ship will never break that may be the reason why there are so many emo kids now a days but sadly the relation dose break maybe by a fatal fake suicide that went wrong and actually did succeed in killing his/her self after all the times you went to gigs to gether all the meaning full shags you had to gether and all the memories you alone will remember. Hope fully this WONT HAPPEN!!. ; Truth: emo love is the same as any ordinary relation ship but with poems blinding love absolutely no cheating and proud to say that there an emo couple oh and cutting if you or your emo partner is into that kinna thing. to be honest it depends how romantic you are toward your emo lover and if your a guy YOU MUST tell her/him that you love her and emo girls should do the same provided that he said 'I love you' first
