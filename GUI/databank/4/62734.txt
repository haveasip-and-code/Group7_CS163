seven samurai
Boring movie in black and white. Many hail as 'greatest movie of all time,' yet give no resoning to support this claim. ; Probably really awesome in the olden ye tymes what with the minimal amounts of fake blood, but now it's... dumb. Seriously, people. It was terrible. ; WAY TOO LONG. Could have been at least an hour shorter.
