Nike
1. The best brand of shoe ever worn by all kinds of people worldwide. Hopefully thogh Nike has stopped using underprivliged children in less fortunate countries! ; 2.When someone won't do something that you want them to bcause they are b'in scared asses, then say 'Nike' because their slogan is 'Just do it.' So Nike pretty much means 'Just do it.'
