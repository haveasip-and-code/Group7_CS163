finger/ flick off
back in medieval days ( horsez and shit) when english invaders captured british archers they would cut off thier middle finger so they were unable to sling arrows. British archers on top of castles would stick up thier middle fingers to the english as a sort of 'havn't got me yet sad fuckers!!!' so now it continues as a 'fuck you' in europe and the US
