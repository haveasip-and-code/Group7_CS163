Ball Ground
A small town in the northeast corner of Cherokee county in the state of Georgia. Named by the Cherokee indians who played stickball it is now becoming much more populated. Ball Ground is also home to the crazy old senile rock collecter Oscar Robertson. He has purchased most of downtown Ball ground so the city is forced to grow around his rock and chinese wooden doll filled buildings
