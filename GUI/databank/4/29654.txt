The Hamptons
An overrated, middle-class community on the eastern tip of Long Island, full of shuttered xenophobes who dislike anyone who's not 'local' and have a particular disdain for City residents who vacation there in the summer. They think that dealing with 'cidiots' each summer is bad? Try dealing with troublemaking Long Island trash every WEEKEND. At least New Jersey and Westchester kids are reasonably well-behaved.
