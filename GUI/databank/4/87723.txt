van halen
A hair rock band from California that could crank out a sound that would turn goat piss into gasoline from 1978 to 1985. During 1985, David Lee Roth, the lead singer, left the group on unhappy terms. His replacement, Sammy Hagar, made something as potent as Van Halen and pussified it so much that it wasn't even recognizable once the change took place.
