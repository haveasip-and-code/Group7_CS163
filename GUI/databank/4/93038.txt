bloop-bloop
The type of (clean) bowel movement where the excrement are tiny and ball-shaped, resulting in a 'bloop-bloop' sound when they break the surface of toilet water. When more of these droppings are released in a continuous and repetitive fashion, the longer the bloop-bloop will be. Some bloop-bloops are known to cause such splashes that will spray toilet water back up the rectum of the depositor. This is known as toilet backdraft.
