Widescreen
The aspect ratios and preferred way to watch most movies filmed after the mid 1950s. The most common widescreen ratios are 1.66, 1.85, 2.35 and 2.40, though there are more. You see more this way than if it's a pan and scan version. It's also the way the sirector and cinematographer wanted the movie to be seen the way the You'll still get small bars on a widescreen TV if you watch some movies because the average aspect ratio of the TV is 1.78 and some movies are wider than that.
