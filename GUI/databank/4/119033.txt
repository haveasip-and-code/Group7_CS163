DLST
DLST is an acronym for 'Dirty Little Slut Tattoo'. This specifically refers to a tattoo found on the lower back of a female. The tattoo generally consists of a celestial object or a decorative horizontal pattern on the external lumbar area, slightly above the sacrum. Such a tattoo obviously has no use to the owner and can only be enjoyed by someone else from behind.
