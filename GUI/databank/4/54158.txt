Liverpool  NY
Okay Sweetheart,lets get some things straight. Before you go mouthing off about how 'stupid' Liverpool is, you may want to do a spell check because last time I checked believe was spelled 'b-e-l-i-e-v-e' and not 'b-e-l-e-a-v-e'. Was that slow enough for you? Do you understand now? Okay good, I'm glad we got that straight. How the hell can you sit there and call us dumb when you cant spell a word like believe? Let's be serious. Also, what the hell does Sears have anything to do with Liverpool High School and the students in it? Are you that shallow to narrow it down to a place where you met someone 'retarted' that was in Liverpool and call EVERYONE in that school district stupid? How do you even know that they went to Liverpool High School? Oh you probably dont. Stop thinking you're the shit because you're probably just another dick from CNS. Don't kid yourself, we do kick ur ass pretty much EVERY YEAR, I'm surprised your not used to it by now. You just have to sit back and realize that, at some sports, Liverpool is better than you. If you aren't mature enough to admit that then go back to elementary school I'm sure you will fit in much better there. Oh one last thing, we only need 21 credits to graduate, I dont know what you're talking about because thats only one less than what you guys need but, not being able to spell an easy word like believe, I wouldnt expect some great math out of you either.
