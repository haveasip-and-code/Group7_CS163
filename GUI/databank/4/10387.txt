mindflank
<i>Verb</i> ; Coined by [Te'Devan Kurzweil], mindflanking is the art of saying something that nobody expects and expanding their mind in doing so. ; Where a generally common/idiomatic exchange may be occuring, you instead say something totally whacked out and unexpected. You break a social convention and their whole perception of that convention is altered. ; I'm not sure about the validity of the perception altering, but it's fun.
