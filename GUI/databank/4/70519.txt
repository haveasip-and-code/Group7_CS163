fartlek
From the German translation 'Speed Play', fartlek is a training exercise used by distance runners to increase their anaroebic capacity. This increases racing performance greatly by allowing muscles to better cope with the lack of oxygen associated with high-intensity activities. The process involves speeding up to race pace for several minutes, then jogging for several minutes, repeating until workout is over.
