geoduck
A large clam-like shellfish that is pretty much illegal to harvest unless you are granted special permissions from the government. The hard-working folks that harvest these fine creatures and called 'Geoduckers'. They live hard and fast lives in the geoducking culture. Every day they make around $5000.00 holding their breath and diving to the bottom of the sea to grab the geoducks. Geoduck poachers can make up to $2 million every 2.5 years.
