smashing pumpkins
One of my (and plenty of other people's) favourite band. Their music is embracing and can be light and soft like 'Soothe' from the album 'Pisces Iscariot' or dark and heavy like 'Zero' from the album 'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness', and anywhere in between. ; A popular (because of mainstream) alt rock band made up of [Billy Corgan] (Vocals, Guitar), James Iha (Guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (Bass), and Jimmy Chamberlin (Drums). Got together 1988 in Chicago, released several albums. ; 1. Gish ; 2. Siamese Dream ; 3. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness ; 4. Pisces Iscariot ; 5. Adore ; 6. Machina: Machines of God ; After the bands breakup in 2000, [Billy Corgan], Guitarist/Vocalist of the Pumpkins and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin formed the band Zwan, while D'arcy Wretzky and James Iha formed Scratchy records. [Billy Corgan] also does some solo songs (Mina Loy, Walking Shade).
