metalcrypt
An elitist message board for discussing all things metal with the exception of what really isn't metal, but is nevertheless called metal by noobs and posers. Based out of Quebec. Run by an elusive code developer who listens to obscene amounts of metal in his spare time. Also offers reviews and editorials. Located at www.metalcrypt.com
