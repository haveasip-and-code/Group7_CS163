requiem for a dream
an amazing movie by darren aronofsky. ; instead of wasting class time for kids with D.A.R.E., just show them this movie. ; it may permanently traumatize them, but they sure as hell won't be doing drugs any time soon. ; also, which most people seem to neglect, an amazing, sad, almost painfully beautifully written novel by hubert selby jr. which, you guessed it, the movie is based upon.
