Order 66
This command was given by the [Galactic Republic]'s [Supreme Chancellor] [Palpatine] to the [Galactic Republic]'s [Clone Troopers] in [Star Wars] [Episode III] [Revenge of the Sith]. Order 66 indicated that the Jedis have betrayed the [Galactic Republic] and therefore the enemies of the [Galactic Republic], the Jedis who are now traitors of the [Galactic Republic] are later on immediately killed by the [Clone Troopers] on sight. ; The number 6 is probably a reference to classic [hexagram], which is something used to put a curse on someone, sort of like the targeting reticle of a gunner.
