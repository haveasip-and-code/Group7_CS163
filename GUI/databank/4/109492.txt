Rhode island school of design, also known as that weird school near brown or the school where everyone is dressed as if they're in a circus. Classes are 8 hours long, than students go back to the studios after dinner and stay up all night working on homework for their next class. ; But we invented lots of cool things, like the new xbox, the show 'the family guy', and various other weird artsy things. ; The school plans to take over the world.
