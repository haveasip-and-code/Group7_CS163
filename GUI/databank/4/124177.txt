Double Flusher
#1. To take a crap so big that your pants fit better. ; #2. To crap a turd so big, one end is sticking out of the water. ; #3. To crap so big around you have to break it up with the plunger and flush twice. ; #4. When you take a crap that stinks so bad, you give a courtesy flush half way though. This act cuts down on the room aroma.
