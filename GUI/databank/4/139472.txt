Alternative
An 'Alternative' is a person or group of people (usually in their teens) who don't fit into any particular labelled group ([goths], [grungers], [chavs], [skaters], etc). ; They listen to what they want and wear what they want but are rarely associated with people like [chavs] and [townies]. ; They are similar to [rockers] in some ways but are usually more individual.
