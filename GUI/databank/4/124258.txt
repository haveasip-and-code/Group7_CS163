hopa
This means half-Japanese. This term is often used lovingly as a cute yet brief self-description. Though it does not disclose the other half of their ethnicity, it's more endearing than mutt. It's important to realize that its a Japanese-American term with the emphasis on being American. The internment camps didn't care how little Japanese or young someone was, they were all considered 'threats to our national security.' Over 110,000 Japanese were locked up on the west coast during WWII, and many of them left to valiantly fight the war for the country that spited their family. Let no one ever tarnish or forget what they went through while still American citizens. They've paid a deeper price to be accepted as Americans than nearly any other group besides African-Americans. Please do not use this term unkindly as it's not what it means and makes you sound like an idiot.
