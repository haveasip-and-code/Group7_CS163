Wide Receiver for the Eagles, once with the 49ers. His resume includes excessive celebration, watching Ms. Sheridan drop her towel, put the football on the star...twice, sign the football with a sharpie, mock Ray Lewis, tear down signs in Cleveland, put the ball on a different star, and usually can initiate fights from opposing players based on his action.
