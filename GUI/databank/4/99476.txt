Bellville Rendevous
The wierdest catoon you've ever seen. Not surprising really, it was made in France. Includes people with noses coming out of thier foreheads, arses on the back of thier legs and the fattest dog ever. About a boy who has always dreamed about being in the famous endurance bike race, Tour De France. So his grandma trains him to become a bicycle racer. From then on, I have no idea what happens. Some guys whos shoulders are above thier heads kidnap him and throw him in a truck with two people who are either: A, zombies, B, Demented or C, Extremely tired. No matter how wierd, it's still beautifully animated.
