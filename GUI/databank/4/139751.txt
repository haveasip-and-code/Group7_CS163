i hope not in ur mouth
Funny answer to someone saying 'I'm coming'. When someone says 'I'm coming', the person probably means that he/she soon will be where the other person is, be that the physical spot or on the server they're going to play on. But 'to come' can also mean naughtier things, which the respondant takes advantage of.
