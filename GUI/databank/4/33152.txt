More British slang that pisses you off to hear when used in any situation where British people aren't being made fun of. Especially frustrating to hear when used in everyday speech, such as on a British web site where you're just trying to find photos of Keeley Hazell, but have to be exposed to this fucked British jargon in order to find some.
