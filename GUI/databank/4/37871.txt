HoCo
1. A place where parrents will pay too much money for houses so their kids can go to preppy schools which the kid's are ashamed to go to because although they envy the lives of the kids on the TV show 'The O.C' they are ashamed to be called rich. ; 2. A place that college students terribly miss when they are away at college, but when the students come home they soon find there are less parties and places to drink than at college and end up calling everyone they know so they can all meet up together and do nothing.
