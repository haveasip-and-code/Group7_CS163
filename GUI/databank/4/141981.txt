Smack-down
To shut someone up by making them look like a dumbass. Mainly, when a person believes's they are right about a certain thing but, are in fact wrong. For example they believe a (i.e. Person made a certain song) but it fact it is a totally different person so they are proved wrong and humiliated in front of a crowd. It is normally proclaimed by one of the on lookers if they believe the diss is worthy of the recognition.
