glen ellyn
Glen Ellyn true is a snobby rich subarnite town, and yeah the cops are kind of crazy and yell at people because they walk around in the streets but who knows, there are some crazy emo kids here though, but then preps are in control and glenbard West now has no money, so i recommend you don't move here.
