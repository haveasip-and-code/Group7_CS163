New Canaan
Home to the utterly fabulous New Canaan Country School..... don't worry that was a joke. They just think they're cool because of those jackets saying 'Mary, varsity everything because we can afford for private lessons in all sports ever created'. New Canaan is basically a civilization that thrives on Lacoste Polos and Lilly Pulitzer cocktail dresses. Throw in a couple bottles of really nice wine, probably from their privates vineyards in Napa Valley or something share of one valuing over $2 million dollars. Of course there is also the lovely town. Ah town, a peaceful place, except when all the Saxe kids and NCHS freshman get out and raid the streets, locating themselves mostly in front of Mackenzie's. Chewing gum and drinking root beer, pay close attention to the root part, thinking 'wow we are bad, we just stole a gummi worm from the jar'. New Canaan mothers spend their mornings getting mani-pedis and the afternoons driving their children from one soccer team to another. A cocktail party and night then off to bed in their master bedroom the size of most apartments.
