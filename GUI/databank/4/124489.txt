potatize
Verb. Originates from the word 'potato', the English word for... well, a potato. We all know what a potato is. But that's besides the point. To potatize is to kill someone with a poisoned potato bought from Jamie Oliver's range at Sainsbury's. These potatoes are part of an evil plot devised by Jamie Oliver to kill us all, and a select few know about these plans. I myself only know because I was told by my dear friend Kaddywyn. Anyway, moving on. Potatization is a very serious affair, and will only be stopped by word of mouth. This definition is helping to save the world, please inform your friends and neighbours.
