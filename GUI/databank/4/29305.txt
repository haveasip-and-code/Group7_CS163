boston college
a.k.a. 'Backup College' A school for wealthy, spoiled children who couldn't get into any of the following schools: MIT, Harvard, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Bunker Hill Community College. Located about as far away from Boston as a school could be while still having the word Boston in its title, BC is known for unattractive women, effeminate men, and a second-rate faculty. They're also known to advertise their football program up and down Massachusetts and Commonwealth Avenues because they can't fill their 45,000 seat stadium. By all measures, Boston College sucks.
