The Stomach Flu
A form of influenza that results from catching a virus and the inflammation of the stomach and intestines, also known as gastroenteritis, and usually lasting from 1-10 days. Common symptoms are vomiting, [diarrhea], fever, lack of energy, and nausea. Unfortunately, the stomach flu often leads to a series of weaker stomach illnesses and diarrhea that can last for another two to three weeks, but vomiting doesn't always occur during these '[aftershocks]'. ; Even though there are no cures or vaccinations available for this, there are still home remedies, however. These include clear, carbonated beverages including Sprite, [Sierra Mist], and 7-Up. In addition, there are foods that are easy on the stomach such as crackers, chicken noodle soup, white rice, bananas, and turkey. One of the best things that can also treat it is getting lots of sleep.
