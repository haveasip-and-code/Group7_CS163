msn
What many people say to define msn messanger so they don't have to say the whole mouthful. They are not purposely trying to get the tearm wrong but just savng time. ; A wonderful program that offers many services such as e-mail and messanging for free. It brings friend and family together without the cost of a phone call. Makes it easyier to arrange going out with friends. ; Has many haters, mainly people with no life, for example everybody who has posted about msn so far because it narrows their chance of talking to anybody just that bit more because all the people with lifes will be to busy talking to each other. Also there are the other hand of people who can't take a company with power and they are lonely so they decide to hate.
