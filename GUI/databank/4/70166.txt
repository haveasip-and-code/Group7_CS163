Well off
A general sort of synonym for 'rich,' similar in use to 'well-to-do.' It's often a term used by those who are accused of being rich, but don't much like the snobbery inherently implied with that term. In such a scenario, it's more supposed to mean something along the lines of, 'having enough money that I don't need to worry about my accounts, but not having so much money that I can buy solid gold houses and carved diamond wristwatches every other Tuesday.'
