british
Whats it like to be British? An understanding of subtle irony in comedy is very important as is a self depreciating sense of humour. Hating the French and most other Europeans would be an advantage but viewing the former colonys as 'naughty children' when they start wars or international feuds etc. Manners and a sense of fair play are also very important. I personally do have bad teeth and see no real malice in americans making jokes about the british teeth (its just a joke!!) ; Oh and on a final note we gave the French mad cow disease LOL!!!
