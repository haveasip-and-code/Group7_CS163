loonies
The word 'loony' comes from the [retarded] superstition that staring at the moon will make you [batshit] [crazy]. It can mean one of 2 things: ; 1)Someone who disagrees with you, and who you do not wish to speak to or listen to. This term can be used by [nancy boy]s and [douchebag]s such as [fundie]s, generally to refer to [lib'rals]. ; 2)Someone who is demonstrably delusional or psychotic. Often these people will disguise their psychosis as a political ideology, generally blaming various groups of [scapegoat]s for all their problems based on negligible or nonexistent evidence.
