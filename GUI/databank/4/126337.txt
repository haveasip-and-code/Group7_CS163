Grrl
the way some young female teenagers use to call themselves. ; usually [poser] teenagers trying to find a pre-made personality that looks cool ; These are usually girls who like feminist rock bands like Bikini Kill ( known as 'Riot Grrl') ; and like to play the role of a bad girl, but they're usually easy prey for most guys ; Note: if you kissed or had sex with one of those girls, you're now probably just a number in a looong list
