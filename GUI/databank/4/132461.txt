wake n bake
To inhale marijuana smoke/vapor immediately upon waking up, usually in the morning. This is the time when there is the least amount of sugar being metabolized to fat in the liver, so less THC is dissolved in the fat and hence there is potential for a higher concentration 0f THC in the bloodstream.
