tuesday
The most random day of the week. Really, it is. All the other days have something going for it, but not tuesday. ; [Monday] is the start of the week. Everyone hates monday...or else. [Wednesday] is the middle day. The day when you can start looking foward to things to came. [Thursday] is...well, as someone said: 'The real start of the weekend, and only one day 'til Friday.' [Friday] is the day before weekend. One of the best days. Saturday and Sunday: The weekend. Nuff' said. ; Tuesday is a tossup. It can be anyhting or nothing at all.
