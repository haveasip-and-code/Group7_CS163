achilles
Not known to be a true or false. Achilles was a warrior, maybe the greatest that ever lived. It is said that his mother held achilles, when he was a baby, by his ankle and dipped him into the river Styx; everything the sacred river touched became invulnerable but the ankle remained dry and unprotected. It is said that during the war for Troy, Achilles was wounded in his tendon and died from the wound. He was not en evil man, just mislead but it is well known that the city of Troy would not of been taken had Achilles not been involved.
