Polar Pop
The greatest drink known to man, available at Circle K. It is the official drink of Jungle Bunny. Basically a 32 oz. drink of your choice in a styrofoam cup, it claims to keep your drink cold longer. However, this is a lie. But it does cost only $0.59 ($0.64 after tax). For best Polar Pop results, mix different beverages. The best known Polar Pop: ; -A good amount of Go Ape! energy drink ; -Some Mountain Dew and Mountain Dew Code Red ; -A good amount of lemonade ; -A little bit of Slice ; -A very, very small amount of unsweetend iced tea ; -If desired, a small amount of slushee can be added as well. This not only tastes good, it keeps the drink cold without requiring ice.
