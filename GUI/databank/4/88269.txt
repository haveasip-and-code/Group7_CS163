Waterstreet
n: veritable [semen]-slide from the vagina to the anus; [cum]-covered [taint]; frequent occurrence in contemporary porn, a WATERSTREET often occurs following [bareback] vaginal sex, when the man pulls out directly after orgasm. ; Note: To be used without an article, like a disease; one contracts 'waterstreet'-- not 'A waterstreet.'
