knock knock ginger
A game played by 8-14 year olds whereby you knock on someone's door, run and hide. It's funnier if you pick the same house a few times and tempt fate. This term is used in Western Canada, particularly the prairies. Same game as [Nicky Nicky Nine Doors] (Eastern Canada), and [Knock Down Ginger]
