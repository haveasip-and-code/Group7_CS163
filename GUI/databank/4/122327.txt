shitkicked
The worst possible way to feel treated by someone. To be metaphorically blindsided as if by a MACK-truck, and sent careening down a flight of stairs to a marble floor, only to be pissed upon by a mocking shadow from the top step before you know what happened. i.e. getting dumped when you did nothing wrong.
