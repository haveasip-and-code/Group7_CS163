Interstate 76 (Western)
One of two interstate highways with the '76' designation (the other being in Ohio and Pennsylvania with about 3 miles of Jersey mixed in), this is an extremely boring nowhere freeway. Its sole purpose is connecting Denver to Chicago and Omaha (via Interstate 80). ; It runs from Interstate 80 at Big Springs, Nebraska, through absolute nothingness for 180 miles, and then ends at Interstate 70 in Denver with NO WARNING. Without knowing it, you are now on Interstate 70, heading west towards the potentially dangerous Rocky Mountains.
