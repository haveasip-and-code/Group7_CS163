Johnny Wizard
A troll that haunts many an innocent forum with incoherent and incognizant ramblings. He mostly complains about President Bush, whom he refers to as the Anti-Christ, and the US Army, the 'Bushmob'. ; Many of his newer rants are simply copy and pastings of all of his older rantings. ; His writing style also leaves much to be desired. His style incorporates invented words, comma abuse and just plain spewage of hatred.
