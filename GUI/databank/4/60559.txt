fry kid
a person hopelessly addicted to hallucinogenic and/or dissociative drugs, or [research chemicals] (q.v. [rc's]) yet to be scheduled by the DEA. ; Usually also implies addiction to the attendant abuse lifestyle that often bridges over into stimulant, (methamphetamine etc.) opiate (heroin, oxycontin etc.) and certainly sedative use. ; usually found in a position of selling one or more of these compounds and/or other drugs to further support this lifestyle. ; not necessarily a term of disparagement. ; however the term usually implies a either a careless disregard towards anything beyond the goal of remaining buzzed as long as possible, ; or it may imply and make fun of certain frequent effects of long-term dissociative abuse obeserved in the personalities of users. ; thus it tends to suggest one is perpetually 'fried' which by the connotation alone certainly does not convey the outward appearance of responsibility, enlightenment or overall enjoyability of a persons particular intoxicated state or its outward manifestations to others.
