Cameron Frye
The morose and depressed sidekick of [Ferris Bueller]. A man who seems to hate the world. Cameron reluctantly lets Ferris get control of his father's 1961 Ferrari GT 250 California to cut school for an insane adventure. In an attempt to roll back the odometer on the Ferrari, the car is left in reverse, and Cameron stupidly kicks the car off the jack and it flies through the back of the garage to a horrible demise at the bottom of a cliff. He finally makes a transition in his life and decides to take the heat from his dad regarding the car and not let Ferris take the fall for him. Those who fit any part of the description below are considered a 'Cameron'
