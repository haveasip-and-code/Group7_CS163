third watch
A fictional show by Nbc that takes you into the live of paramedics, police officers, and firefighters during the third watch shift (3 PM- 11PM) in NYC. A great show which airs on A&E weekdays at 5(eastern GMT -5:00) and Fridays at 9 on NBC. Unfortunatly, it will be cancelled after it's sixth and final season.
