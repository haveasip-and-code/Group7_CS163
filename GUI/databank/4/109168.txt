Christopher Walken
A veteran actor with loads of dark roles to his credit, Christopher Walken is one of the most entertaining, consistent performers ever. Although most people believe him to be an absolute wacko, many of his excellent supporting roles are the stuff of legend, and there are few Hollywood stars that are as respected as he is.
