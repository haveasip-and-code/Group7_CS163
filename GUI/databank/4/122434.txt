hello dave
Quote from 'The League of Gentlemen', character PAPA LAZAROU, a warped character that speaks gibberish and insists everyone is called Dave and that they are his wife. Unfortunately for anyone actually called Dave in real life they may have found that when they introduce themselves they are subjected with this quote.
