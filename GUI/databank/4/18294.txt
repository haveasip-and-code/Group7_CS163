the aristocrats
Title of infamous joke without a punchline. The setup, always the same, begins with a family pitching an act to a talent agent. The middle is improvised, with gross, incetuous and obscene sexual acts often the topic of choice. The joke ends with the agent asking what the bizarre act is called, and the family replies 'the aristocrats.'
