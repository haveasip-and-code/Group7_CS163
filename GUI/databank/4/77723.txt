Marist Boys
A young man attending the Marist School in Atlanta. Usually a boy who is so full of himself from his Buckhead upbringing that he forgets how his school is the most inferior of the Atlanta Big Four. He tries to be cool, but in reality is just a poser of the much cooler Woodward or Westminster boy. After coming to this important realization, a Marist boy will curse his parents for not sending him to Woodward and then try to forget all the 'good times' he thought he had living his life of ignorance.
