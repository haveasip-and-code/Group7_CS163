myspacitis
Myspacitis is a little known yet widespread disease that affects many in our nation, and even globally. The sufferer experiences having no life and spending hours upon hours browsing random people on MySpace. Their 'thing' is to gain as many friends as possible, as to up their 'cool points'. They also strive to make their music lists, well, bigger than yours. Even if they've barely listened to the artists they put on there. Those are just the major symptoms.
