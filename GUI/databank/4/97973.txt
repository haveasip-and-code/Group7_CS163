skier
commonly mispelled as skieer, skiir, skiieer, or idiot, a skier is someone who has no fear. A true skier (there are many imposters) can 'ride' a whole mountain. THey are able to pull insane tricks, like double-backflip-900-helicopter-indy grab to switch-triple-frontflip-360- nose grab. They can also ski in light snow called 'powder' while defying the laws of gravity by not sinking in. A true skier is a great athlete, and can generally do loops around a snowboarder in any part of a mountain.
