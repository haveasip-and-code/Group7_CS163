my prerogative
[Britney Spears]' all time worst song. It gets too much [hype] for her using 2 tones in her voice through the entire song. The sex appeal of the music video was [sub par] to her 'uniquely' [scandalous] clothing such as jewel suits and tight leather. In the 'My Prerogative' music video, she simply rolls around on a bed in a concealing [bra] and a pair of bland [panties]. Not as [sexy] as she was aiming for.
