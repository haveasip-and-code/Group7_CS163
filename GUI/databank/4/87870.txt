slasted
A word meaning the same as 'owned,' 'pwned,' 'pwnz0red' or any of the ridiculous and pathetic l33t terminology used online and in groups of nerds. Its primary usage though is to stand-in for the words 'owned' or 'pwned' and make nerds use it to sound even more like idiots. It's a completely false word, and only exists to torment losers.
