Commit That
Short for Commit that suicide. ; Meaning shut the hell up, or something similiar. The word comes from a [Juelz Santana] song called 'Kill Yourself.' The song is about suicide and on the chorus Santana raps 'Commit that, Commit that, suicide....' That's where it came from. You usually tell someone to 'Commit That' when someone says something incredibly stupid or if you win an arguement or something along those lines, tell them to kill themselves.
