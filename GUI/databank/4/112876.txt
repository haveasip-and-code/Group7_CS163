Boxford
One of the most boring place to live in Massachusetts. Boxford is the one and only place where the tree population and bug population outnumber the human population by at least 100 to 1. There is usually a mile between each house and neighbors only see each other occasionally, at the local library, church, at the community store dubed 'Jacks'/'Waynes', or when they manage to escape to modern civilization. Modern cvilization, however, is at least 15 minutes (by car) away in every direction.
