Rubedo
Leader of the URTVs in the video game series [Xenosaga]. URTV stands for U-DO Retrovirus. Rubedo, also known as Jr., is the eldest of the three surviving URTVs, though his body's aging was completely halted by his own doing fourteen years before the present in Miltia. Because of this, he is often teased about his height, despite being 26 years old -- the crew of his ship, the Durandal, has come to know him as Little Master. Unlike his two surviving brothers, he has vibrant red hair. His weapon of choice is a pair of guns.
