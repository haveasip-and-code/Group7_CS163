This Is The Credited Response. ; Used on discussion boards (at least on [xoxohth]) when a respondent makes a statement that is either poignant, valid or otherwise hilarious. It is what someone writes after another person makes a well reasoned or an on-point observation in the course of a thread. ; Origin: Likely reference to standardized test questions in which there are multiple wrong answer choices, but only one credited response. ; Those who use this term are generally of high intelligence, but completely overly occupied with the nuances of the admissions process. Most need to get a life and stop wasting their youth posting on anonymous admissions related boards.
