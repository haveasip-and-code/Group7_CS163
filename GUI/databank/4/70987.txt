Boohbah
A very disturbing children's show from [Britain]. Like their forerunners, the [Teletubies], they have been smuggled onto public television in the United States of America. Unlike other things that have come to America from Britain, such as [monty python] and [the Beatles], this show has no value of any type. ; They are round creatures that look as if they had become entangled in seperate colors of christmas lights, each one being it's own color, with five in all. They appear to move about by flatulation, giving new meaning to the expression '[farting around]'. Despite their cute appearance, they are, in fact, the spawn of [Hell] and the servants of [Satan]. They seek to make the next generation docile and complacent, so that when the final battle comes, they will be either too stupid or too scared to fight. This was formerly the task given to the [Teletubies], but their cover was exposed. ; Here are some words of warning to anyone who may catch a glimpse of these mostrosities while flipping channels, wash your eyes! If, for any reason, you find them to be, in any way, shape, or form, 'cute', seek mental health counseling immediately. In case you have become attracted to them in any way( esp. sexually), kill yourself before you spread this plague.
