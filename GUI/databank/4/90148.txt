woodstock
woodstock, a hot town just 30 mins from ATL! sure its in the middle of georiga but no one who lives here was actually born and raised in georgia we are all from the north! we are well off people with nice things in a bigger town than it seems but its really spilt into two towns, one downtown woodstock and towne lake (where us the sorta rich people live). everyone you know is always at the local supermarket so u really cant get a gallon of milk with out running into everyone and their mom.
