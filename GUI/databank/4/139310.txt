Cowboy Coffee
Making a great cup of coffee in the backcountry is easy when you prepare it the way cowboys have done for over a century. Simply pour the coffee grounds into a cup of hot water and stir. Most of the coffee will dissolve in the water. The remaining grains are then sifted through the front teeth. This is also a great solution for poor people who cannot affort a $5 cup of joe from Starbucks.
