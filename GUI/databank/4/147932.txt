ghost poo
A ghost poo is _the_ rarest and king of all poos. It challenges your grasp on reality, because when you look in the bowl to see what you've done (don't worry, eveyone does this) there is no smell and nothing there... puzzling enough, but when you wipe your arse it's already as clean as... well as clean as it ever was. ; The ghost poo is smooth and firm enough to be ejected with ; 'toilet escape velocity' i.e. you shot it right around the u-bend. So it not only disappears but there is no lingering pong, as it only had a millisecond of exposure to the atmosphere. ; So... did you really poo. The only evidence is few unreliably changed synapses that are busy trying to work out more important stuff.
