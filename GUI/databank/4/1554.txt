nordic
Generally speaking, anybody of Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish (arguably) and Icelandic descent, but quite a few people from other northern European countries (including Latvia, Germany and some people in the UK) would consider themselves Nordics too. Nordics are stereotyped as having blond hair and blue eyes, and this is not too far from the truth. Another typical trait is their cheekbones or face shape. For some it is often seen as the same sort of idea as the Aryan race, and there are some neo-Nazi groups who are more specifically based on the idea of Nordic superiority. ; Nordic women are quite often very attractive.
