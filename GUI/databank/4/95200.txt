Hollister Co
A store owned by Abercrombie and fitch which tailors to the 'surfer' image. They sell their shirts tight, their shorts big, and all of it is just a bit less expensive than Abercrombie and Fitch. They have some nice stuff- their jeans and shorts and shirt are durable, and most everything I own from their is very comfortable to wear. They do cater to guys and glas who like to keep good care of themselves, but I don't know a single girl or guy who shops at Hollister and is gay. The Gay ones that I know all shop at Urban outfitters, Gap and Banana Republic.
