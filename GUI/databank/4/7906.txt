groove radar
A system of displaying the difficulty of a song in [Dance Dance Revolution], first used in [DDR] 6th Mix (DDR MAX). It is represented as a circle with a star shape in the middle that stretches to show the values of five points on it. It was created to give players a better idea of what to expect when going into a song, instead of just an arbitrary number for difficulty, the foot rating (although this was later put back in under the groove radar in DDR 7th Mix aka DDR MAX 2.) ; AIR represents the frequency of 'jumps' (two-arrow hits) in a song. ; FREEZE represents the frequency of hold arrows. ; STREAM is the overall density of steps in the song. ; VOLTAGE is the maximum density of steps. ; CHAOS is still somewhat unknown. A DDR simulator called [Stepmania] represents Chaos as the number of off-beat steps (as in, not 4th or 8th notes), but in actual DDR games, it seems to be the overall 'irregularity' of steps.
