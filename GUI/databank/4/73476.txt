jungle bunny
A low class black person. This is not the same thing as an African American, as the politically correct term should only apply to those of color who are deserving of respect. An African American is nice, does not recieve governent assistance, and does not live a life of crime. Jungle bunnies, on the other hand, live off of foodstamps and the meager wages they receive from stealing cheap electronics.
