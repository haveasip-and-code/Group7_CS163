Rasmus
Creators of the music of angels, this Finnish band's tunes are as hypnotizing as the rushing sounds of the Niagara Falls, as powerful as the rising sun revealing a new day, and as beautiful as the Northern Lights themselves. The band sounds awesome, and all members are...Hmm,how can I put it...Leaders of their own style, outcasts that are loved what for they are, and best of all: As original as can be. ; +SWEET,BEAUTIFUL,ORIGINAL+ (I could go on and on, but I would take forever.. =D )
