Rhys
Ignore the last four definition's Rhys is a person, A normal human being who's concept on life goes far beyond that of a normal person. Personaly Rhys is God to most and isn't that little prissy boy and his enemies who can't spell for shit. Grammar rules, and prepy grudge holding whores suck. ; Owned~
