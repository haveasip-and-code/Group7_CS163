Trolling
Trolling is gererally the act of visiting a website at very high frequency (more than once every 5 minutes) ; 1. Visiting a specific website at high frequency (more then once every five minutes), searching indefinetly for updates, clicking every link, downloading every photo, reading every piece of text, etc. ; 2. Visiting an online forum in order to read every single thread, over and over...even if you've read it 10 times already, meanwhile searching for that one lucky thread where you might be able to throw in a 'lol' or 'word up', though it probably won't be necessary.
