Stonewall jackson high school in Northern Virginia
One of the most pathetic places one could ever be at. It's full of kids who think they are emo, but whose biggest problem is their lame attempts at being posers. Then there are the posers who are so obvious. My favorites are the kids who dress in black with piercings and are supposed to be goth, but are really nice people if you get to know em... then the rich kids who wanna act poor so they don't get the crap kicked out of em. Half of the kids are stoners, the other half morons. I fit somewhere in there, but the again, so could you.
