Hussey
Used to describe an attractive girl, often one that is a few years younger than ones self. Girl must be young and not particularly smart, but also flirtatious and appealing and have friends that are older guys. In this meaning, the word does not in anyway mean that the girl is a [slut] or anything of that nature. If anything, it means that they are inexperienced and unguided.
