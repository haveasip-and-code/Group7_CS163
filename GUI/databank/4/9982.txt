Annapolis
amazing. if you want a smoke ride when youre in annapolis, you go to davidsonville or bay ridge. if youre into the booze, well youre going to robinwood or probably your parents who love to buy you and your friends alcohol. if its up the nostril, you know plenty of kids from st marys who will oblige. always shroom in quiet waters park. always go to crown for the freshest blunts. two dollars says you drive an explorer or a jeep cherokee. lax RULES, even if you quit in high school. lowrys gas sales on sunday and wednesday. you play the lottery for beer money but when you lose youre like FUCK mom can i have 20$? its life.
