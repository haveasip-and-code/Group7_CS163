runescape
A large MMORPG game with the qualities of the following. ; -Heroin ; -Nicotine ; -Caffeine ; It's an addictive, pointless game. I used to play it basically 24/7 so take this from someone with experience, DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. Even 'trying it out' can ghave devastating effects, I was just 'trying it out' and it led to about one year of pure Runescape, forgetting this thing called a life. ; It's an MMORPG, that takes you and just doesn't let you go... except unlike other MMORPGs, this is in a bad way.
