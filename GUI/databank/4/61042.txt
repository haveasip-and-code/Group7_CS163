the who
They rival The Beatles when it comes to progression. They started as an R&B cover band, catering to their [mod] audience. From there, they produced angst-ridden singles like I Can't Explain and My Generation. ; They might be best known for their rock opera Tommy, about a deaf dumb and blind boy who becomes a pinball champion and a spiritual leader. ; Quadrophenia, another rock opera by The Who, is musically superior to Tommy but lesser known by the general public. It tells the story of a mod named Jimmy who struggles to find his identity and find happiness. I wouldn't be surprised if it strongly influenced [American Idiot]. ; Between the two rock operas, they produced Who's Next, known for Baba O'Riley (aka 'Teenage Wasteland), Behind Blue Eyes, and Won't Get Fooled Again. ; During their early years, guitarist Pete Townshend and drummer Keith Moon would smash their equipment at the end of their gigs. Good way to get out of doing an encore!
