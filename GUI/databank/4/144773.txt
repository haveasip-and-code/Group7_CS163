Nuh Muh
'Nuh Muh' was created by mistake, when a girl named Faye found it difficult to do the [rock on] sign using her index and little finger, instead using the thumb and little finger. As [rock on] is written online as '\m/', the extra finger on her hand gave rise to '\nm/', from which were derived the sounds of 'nuh' and 'muh', repectively, giving the hand action a name. ; Instead of being used as a direct substitute for [rock on], 'Nuh Muh' has been transfigured into meaning that something is 'cool', in the sense that it is good, or noteworthy. ; A colloquialism only used by a handful of people, 'Nuh Muh' is set to take the world by storm, and soon, nations will be using it to describe how brilliant things are. I hope. ; Nuh Muh can also be shortened to the following: ; - Nuhmuh/nuhmuh ; - \nm/ ; - NM (nm is commonly misused as 'Never Mind' in online acronyms, but it *should* be nvm)
