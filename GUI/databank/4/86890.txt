Zombies
Noun: (Zohm-bees) ; Commonly confused as brain suckers. These originated from the religion of [Voodoo]. They are the dead brought back to life only in the body, while the soul is in torment. The only reason they walk the earth is to bite the living, who, once bitten also become a zombie. They are usually formed from a curse on a living person, who once dead will become one.
