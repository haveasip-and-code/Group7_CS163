'97
The year anyone with a flux capacitor would want to visit. ; A good year fo [B -Vice] to smoke that sticky icky green Shiiiiiiit and say Fuckin Fuck alot. A bad year for innocent collars of misfits t shirts. A great year for red jeeps and rebel flags. A good year for cough syrup, Carl's Junior, Swan Lake, Denny's, Oogies, parties in [Jake Bo]'s basement, and Jubilee. ; The year of the original penis bottle rocket, the full effect of the blue blazer and many other timeless pieces of forgotten awesomeness.
