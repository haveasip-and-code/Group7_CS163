Sumguy
The name of a mythical super-collector, who always gets to flea markets/thrift stores/yard sales/boot sales/etc. and purchases all of the worthwhile merchandise you are personally seeking out. Also spelled as 'Sum Guy.' ; Started in rec.games.video.classic, as the name of an individual always invoked by sellers who would tell inquiring collectors 'yeah, we had a lot of <insert collectible here> until some guy came in and bought them all.' That line, or variations, was so common, that it was determined that there was a single person wreaking all of this havok, and the sellers were actually stating his name- Sumguy. ; Applicable to all frustrated collectors who shop in vain for their favored items.
