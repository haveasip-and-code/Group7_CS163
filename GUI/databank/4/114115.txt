croquet
Once played by hardy youngsters to prove who could sustain such a terribly dull pastime longer than the other as part of some sort of sick competition. Now played by ill-knowledged persons who know nothing of real sports. The height of croquet came about around the end of the 19th century but died soon after it was banned from the Olympics for being so horrendously boring and stupid. Vestiges of this game are commonly found hidden under a bunch of crap in the corner of your grandpa's garage or a hundred feet deep within a landfill.
