its on like donkey kong
a phrase used to incite fear in an opponent, so much more than simply 'it's on', the inclusion of primate legend Donkey Kong stems from DK's penchant for victory. used by one [Steve Stifler] in American Pie 3 to provoke Mr [Paul Finch]. also, the worst insult/compliment that can be used in a checkers game.
