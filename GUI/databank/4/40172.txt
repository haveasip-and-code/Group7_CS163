m3
A decent sports car for its price... more room then a vette, but if you're buying a sports car, why not get a vette for the same price? ; Image of people who drive M3's is quite low amung other drivers, because of their stupid freeway antics and if you can actually afford one, you're better off buying a V8 and tuning it for the price.
