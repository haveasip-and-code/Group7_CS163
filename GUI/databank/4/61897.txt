anzac day
25th April every year. ; In [canberra] in the morning theres a dawn service which i've never been to. But then there's a country wide march, which almost everyone goes to, to remember the soldjers. ; We all get a day off school/work, and the shops are all closed until 1pm. ; And did someone say Anzac bikkies?
