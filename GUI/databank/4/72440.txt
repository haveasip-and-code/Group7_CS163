Felitz
Felitz is an anomolous phenomenon in the source code of an obscure Linux distro. Through a freakish turn of events he was transposed from tens of millions of lines of code into flesh and blood. He spends his days searching for a way back into the machine, mechanistically creating billions of lines of code... He also enjoys creating maps for computer games. Some say these maps are recreations of the only mental images he has left of his true, binary home.
