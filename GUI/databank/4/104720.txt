Towson University
They house some of the trashiest women in the world at this university. Unfortunately it is also located in one of the top areas in the nation for STDs, that says a lot for the women on this campus. The greek life on this campus is weak and cannot rival any school in the U.S. The students on this campus are either transfer students from local community colleges or just the students who could not get into a decent college so they had to fall back on this state university. Most people seem to forget it was not long ago that this was called Towson State but they had to change the name so they wouldn\\\'t be considered such trash. Basically this campus is home to trashy girls and high school screw-ups who will never make anything out of their lives. I actually feel bad for the people who graduate from here because all they really did was waste their money to become nothing. Sorry to hear that and have to explain the truth to you.
