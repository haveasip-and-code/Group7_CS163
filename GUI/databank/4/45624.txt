Ti
a rapper from ATL.quoted from Ti in an interview 'Well my name is Tip. Anybody that knows me from the streets or knows me personally calls me Tip. My momma calls me Tip, my grandmomma calls me Tip, everybody. When I rap I say T.I.P. because when I say Tip, because of my accent, people used to think I was saying Chip, Chuck, you know.. so I spell it out T.I.P. ; I got signed as T.I.P. but when LaFace Records merged with Arista that put me on the same label as Q-Tip and they didn't want to work two albums with names so similar. So they asked me to change my name to T.I. '
