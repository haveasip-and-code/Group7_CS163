roaching
v. to roach; the act of ripping and rolling up paper, card, or any other suitable material, to be utilized as [a roach] in a [joint], [spliff] or [hand-rolled cigarette]. ; The roach is a small rolled up piece of paper that is placed at the mouth end of the joint to provide separation from the smokeable contents of the joint so that, toward the end of the joint, the smoker's lips aren't burned. The roach also lends some structural support to the joint (the larger the joint, the larger the roach)
