No more secs!
Its sounds like no more sex. But really it means no more seconds. If someone like a child is doing something and someone else like a parent or teacher tells them not to, and then the child says 'one sec', and then if the child say that a few times the parent or teacher will usually end up saying 'No more secs!'.
