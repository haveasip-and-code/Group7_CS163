zath
A 'zath' is basically someone who is half-way between a [mosher] and a [goth]. ; Zaths listen to the same music as both moshers and goths do, and usually wear black or other dark colours, but they don't have the eyeliner and make-up etc that goths do. ; The word started off in Harrogate, North Yorkshire (UK), and is spreading across the country.
