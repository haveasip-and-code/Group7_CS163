Gogo
In my opinion the best music thats isnt really mainstream.I mean you have people who know about and people who dont and badmouth it.It uses so many instruments depending on the song.Pacman poppin by TCB for example mainly uses song effects and drums in the background,its a good gogo song but it certainly shouldnt be used as a prime example of gogo music as a whole like maybe 98 dopejam by BYB should.In a gogo song there maybe rappin, talkin, shoutouts, or they let the beat ride out.In a gogo song for the most part they shout out hoods in the [metro area] such as Sursum Cordas, 36 & Minnesota,Trinidad ave, 31-31, KDY, etc and local gangs such as Superstar honnies, X-rated honnies, or Most wanted honnies.I love gogo to death and [byb] [tcb] [ucb] [raw image] and rare essence, ccb, familiar faces, fatal attraction, and MOB are my favorite bands.If you want to purchase gogo cds go to either papalace.com or gogocds.4t.com or if you live in the metro area go to Kemp Mill music in Marlow Heights near where I stay at to get them.UD I dont mean to advertise for these businesses because I dont work for either im just informing people where to buy cds in case they are interested.Also if you stay near DC and you read this you know why my name on here is what it is.
