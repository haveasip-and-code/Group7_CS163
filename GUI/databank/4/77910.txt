Park Ridge High School
Where everyone is white and those who are not are white-washed. Where the teachers talk about girls in bikinis, Star Trek, and anything and everything besides school. Where stupidity is at its peak and students call a Rhombus 'Rum-bus'. Where TV's fall on teacher's heads and no one can find a decent substitute.
