11:11
A retarded number that people think has some sort of meaning all the time. They say it's crazy that they happen to look and see 11:11 on the clock all the time. But human beings look at clocks, on average, around every five minutes, so you could pick any time, like say, 9:43, and happen to, AMAZINGLY, see it everyday too. Don't think you're special because you see 11:11 all the time. You're just the same decaying organic matter as everyone else.
