Tampa
A Florida city surrounded by areas that suck. A shining beacon in the middle of [backswamp] hick counties full of oxygen thieves. A traffic nightmare like no other - correction, like everything else in this state. One of the few non-tourist-traps that our state has to offer to entertain residents. Also one of the most dangerous places in the US, and home to some of the least successful sports franchises in existance.
