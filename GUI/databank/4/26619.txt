jewish-buddhists (jubus)
A Jewish person who finds fulfillment in Buddhist philosophy and practices, but has not given up their Jewish identity. Mostly found in those of the 'baby boomer' generation who were unsatisfied with a stauch, unfeeling Judaism of the 1950's and 1960's. For an excellent illustration of this group of Jews who make up rougly 30% of practicing Buddhists in America see 'Jew in the Lotus,' by Rodger Kamenetz.
