full metal alchemist
An excellent show with an original plot and endearing characters. Even though the pacing suffers in the second half, this show is a pioneering anime that blends humor, legend, and characterization to produce a true anime classic. ; Regarding the ridiculous flame war between Inu Yasha fans and FMA fans: ; Inu Yasha is funny and somewhat interesting, but it suffers from horrible pacing, pointless filler episodes, and jaded anime hallmarks that wear out quickly. FMA may have a few scattered cliches, but it never slows down as a series. ; Hey, at least it ended.
