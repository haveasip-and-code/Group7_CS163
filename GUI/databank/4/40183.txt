hor hor hor
came from the computer game Sango Fighter from the character Xia Hou Dun. It was originally used as an exclamation or acknowledgement of sorts, but has been gradually progressed to mean anything. It can be a verb, noun, or adjective. If you're at a loss of words, just replace whatever you wanted to say with 'hor hor hor' ; can be shortened to 'horhor'
