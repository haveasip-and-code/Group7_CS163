America
America is a continent situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It has three parts: North America, Center America and South America. Even though everyone who was born in this continent should be called 'American' this name is used only for people who was born in the United States 'of' America which is only one country in this huge continent. And let's not forget the real inhabitants of this continent, the aborigins who were killed and damaged were the real americans too. However, in the spanish language the word 'Americano' (translation for american) means anyone who was born in the continent called America, though some people can use this word to name the north american people, that's just a show of how powerful imperialist countries can impose whatever they want to anyone behind them. More specific words would be: North American, Center American and South American.
