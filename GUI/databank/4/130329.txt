Grade Eight
Grade eight is a term coined to describe incredibly immature behavior most predominantley present in grade eight students. this is not a derogatory term for a grade, but an attitude; these are the people who saw [napoleon dynamite] only because it became a trend, and then fucking ruined it with their retarded incessant [pseudo-quotations]. ; The term also applies to the losers responsible for [sk8ers] and the like. my advice, burn them. set them on fire and do not put them out until they are melted to the fucking pavement
