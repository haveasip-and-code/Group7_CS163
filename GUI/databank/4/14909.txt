billy goat curse
The curse that prevents the [Chicago] Cubs from ever winning the National League Pennant. Contrary to what a previous user wrote, the curse began in 1945 when a tavern owner tried to bring his pet goat into Wrigley Field during Game 1 of the World Series because it was a good luck charm. Security didn't allow it and as they escorted him out he declared that the Cubs would never again win the pennant. And they haven't.
