BALTIMORE
A city which has the second highest crime rate in America, among the worst public schools in America, and a facinating condition whereas walking for 5 minutes in ANY direction will land you in a crime infested neighborhood. ; I lived in Pittsburgh, Boston, Washington, Chicago, and Baltimore. Trust me, Baltimore is the worst. ; For those who blindly defend Baltimore, you probably don't know what a real city is.
