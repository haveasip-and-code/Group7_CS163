The City
What natives of the Bay Area use to refer to San Francisco. All other cities have nothing on San Francisco and San Francisco is the only one that earns the title of 'The City' (check the Warriors jerseys). Also can be refered to as the sco, 415 or Frisco, but only by natives. When people other than Natives call San Francisco by these names its a sign of disrespect, as they obviously really don't know what they're talking about by the context it tends to be used in.
