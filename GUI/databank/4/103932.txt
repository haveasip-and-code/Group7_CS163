White Guys Jumping
White Guys Jumping are so cool, that they don't need a drummer, guitarist, Bass Guitarist, or anything else. All they need/have is a keyboard and three very talented individuals. White Guys Jumping is taking the world by storm with their smash hit single 'BOOOOT!' and someday may come to your town. But that's only if you're lucky. The real question is, 'Will White Guys Jumping ever be a real band?' Well, we'll find out soon now, won't we?
