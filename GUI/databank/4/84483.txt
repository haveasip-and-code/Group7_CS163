Violent Femmes
A 3 piece punk-folk-rock-band from Milwaukee. Relatively well known to generation X-ers for their college anthems ('Add it Up' 'Blister in the Sun' 'Kiss Off' 'Gimme the Car'). ; They consist of Gordon Gano (Vocals, Guitar) Victor DeLorenzo (Drums, back up vocals) & Brian Ritchie (insane bass guitar, back up vocals - some lead). ; One of the greatest bands of the last 20 years, and definitely the best live act still touring today. ; Unfortunately, a lot of their catalogue has been overshadowed by their #1 hit 'blister in the sun' - one of their lesser tracks, but one that had an infectious refrain which caught the attention of the mass consciousness. ; They've had a few revivals (or just off mainstream revivals) over the years. 'American Music' was a big hit from 'Why do birds sing', 'Blister in the Sun' is a movie soundtrack favourite and Ethan Hawke covered 'Add it Up' in Reality Bytes. ; Tragically, a mini-thesis could be written on how the usage of the song 'Add it Up' (and the censoring of it) within Reality Bytes represented exactly what was lacking in the movie. ; Still, there are few bands with more quotable songs - and fewer bands with more rabid fans. ; Trivia: Even if you haven't heard of the femmes, chances are you've heard Gordon play - as the guitarist for the Law & Order theme.
