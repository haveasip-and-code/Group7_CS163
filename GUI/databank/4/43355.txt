schmicker
the English corruption of the ancient (circa 1960's USA) phrase 'schmuck, her.' The phrase was doubly derogatory. It was used among heterosexual males to indicate worthless specimens of the species, as well as to further belittle said specimens by implying a highly effeminate nature. Eventually, an unwilligness to expend much energy on such 'shmucks' prompted speakers to contract the phrase into 'Schmicker,' its current incarnation.
