New York Yankee's
Have been known for winning the World Series 50% of the time. Always sucking up any good free agents, denying newer, less fortunate teams from having them, they are big-league hogs, and have a payroll more than double most teams, sometimes triple, yet in the start of the 2005 season, the sucked more balls then a 3 cent mexican prostatute. It amazes me how anyone can be a fan of the Yankess, I think it would be awfully boring watching the Yankee's when you know they have the biggest advantage in baseball. ; Yankee's don't do baseball anymore, they do bussiness.
