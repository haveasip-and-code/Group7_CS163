Messerschmitt bf109
The Messerschmitt Bf 109(or Me 109) was a [WW2] single engined fighter designed by Willy Messerschmitt and built mainly by Bayerische Flugzeugwerke. It was widely considered the [Luftwaffe] equivalent to the [RAF] [Spitfire]. Although widely derided nowadays as being difficult to fly, poor performing, and aerodynamically unrefined; the Me 109 was still the preferred mount of most of Germany's aces, including Erich Hartmann -the highest scoring ace of all time, with 352 kills. The 109 was first used in the Spanish civil war and served throughout all of WW2, with derivatives being built postwar in [Spain] and [Czechoslovakia]. With roughly 33,000 of the countless versions built, the Me 109 was one of the most produced aircraft of all time.
