black mage
One of the most revered online comic characters in existence. The sprite who was quoted saying - 'Love is a very powerful force. Even moreso when it's focused into a coherent beam of destruction. Every time i cast hadoken, it siphons away some of the love in the universe. I'm not sure how much, but I'm given to understand the divorce rate goes up with each blast.'
