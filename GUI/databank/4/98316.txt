Cookie Monster
An obvious junkie. One whose addition is so far gone that he or she cannot focus his or her eyes or consume the addictive substance properly. Often seen throwing cookies at their own faces, crumbling them up in their mouths and not swallowing or babbling incoherrently or both. Looks dazed, blue and cross-eyed.
