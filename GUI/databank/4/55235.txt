Neo-Christanity
Neo-Christianity is made up of the people on the religious right, who preach love yet support wars, who preach tolerance yet hate gay people, who preach peace yet rage against people who disagree with them. Basically people who say they follow the teachings of Jesus but actually follow the teachings of George W. Bush.
