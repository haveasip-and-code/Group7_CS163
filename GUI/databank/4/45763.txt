Zany
A once cool word that was killed because it was over-commercialized, much like [extreme] except for the fact that the word extreme is totally shitty. ; I sometimes let zany slip from time to time, i say it in a surfer dude voice like 'Wow! What a zany guy' but mostly I use it sarcastically, by that I mean I say that Richard Nixon is zany. Nixon actually was a thieving, Cheneyesque, monster. Maybe some day zany will make a big comeback, most likely from the streets of Jamaica Queens.
