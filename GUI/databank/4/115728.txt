Loser
Apparently it's anyone who doesn't spend all his time and money at the bar every night, someone who doesn't feel the need to get laid every five seconds, anyone who doesn't make a million dollars a day, someone who's at home for more than two hours a day, anyone over the age of 12 who still lives at home with his parents, and anyone who's ever touched a computer or videogame.
