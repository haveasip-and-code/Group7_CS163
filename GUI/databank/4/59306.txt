metalhead
Metal head - Group of musical listeners that are often described as drunkards, partiers, and fighters, but this is a bit of a stereotype. Metal heads often listen to classic rock along with blues rock, classical, and opera based music, since those 2 genres are the root of what rock music could be considered today and the dawn of all music. Metal heads tend to have a powerful dislike towards the close-minded and mainstream. The majority tend to be very liberal and anti-conservative, but not all of course. Metal lyrics are often quite political and have more meaning than what people say. Metal music is very often stereotyped as ' satanic devil related material' . This is the worst stereotype of them all and the reason many don't give metal a chance. Metal lyrics also deal with independence, pride, and free will. The metal genre has more sub-genres that any other musical genre existing today. These genres are often known as classic metal, death metal, black metal, grind core, thrash metal, symphonic metal, opera metal, folk metal, Viking metal, industrial metal, progressive metal, power metal, etc etc. All are tied together in the same branch and all kick ass if I do say so myself. Way back when there was a rivalry between punks, metal heads, and skinheads. This rivalry has long since dwindled out and people have matured today ( for the most part ) . There is no particular attire, metal heads tend to dress however they damn well please and this is great. But many people believe the attire to be faded blue jeans with black band tee-shirts. Long and/or wavy type hair style usually passing the eyes. Metal heads don't give a shit about what's trendy or what other people wear and allow people to dress and express themselves as they please without bitching about it like many ' new generation punk rockers' do today.
