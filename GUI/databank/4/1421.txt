severna park
severna park is the epitome of stuck up. we all act modest, but we know we are the best...even though most parkies aren't. it's a place every parent wants their child to grow up. we all know that we are snobby sons of bitches but that doesn't stop us from letting everyone and their mother know it too. we walk around with our popped collars, abercrombie and fitch, and lacrosse sticks like it's our job. the number one person in our lives is ourself. you mean nothing to us. no one messes with a parkie. cuz if you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. we are the great parkies and you can only wish you were one of us.
