Lorenzen
A Lorenzen, also known as the Russian Switch, occurs when one staunchly supports an idea or opinion, only to suddenly lose interest when said opinon/idea is proven inaccurate. The maneuver often frustrates people, who don't understand why they just spent 5 minutes arguing against someone who apparently didn't have an actual opinion or viewpoint to begin with.
