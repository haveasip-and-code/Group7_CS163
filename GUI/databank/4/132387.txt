Japophilia
See [wapanese]. A form of francophilia practiced amongst the less educated or pretentious. The phenomena is reffered to as 'Transferred Nationalism' by Orwell in his 'Notes on Nationalism.' Specific to japophilia, this typically entails an irrational love for all things japanese including anime, martial arts, and [yellow fever]. Most people consider it odd that japophiles have rarely visited Japan itself, but it is actually this seperation that makes it easy for them to commit the intellectual suicide necessary to believe in Japan's superiority.
