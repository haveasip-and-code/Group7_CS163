Pumpkinhead
1. A hillbilly horror movie released in 1989 featuring actor Lance Henriksen as the film's protagonist. Lance plays a man whose son is accidentally killed by rambunctious city kids on dirt bikes. Instead of phoning the police, the man instead seeks the aid of a witch living in solitude, who aids him in unleashing a insidious demon upon the youths. The demon was nicknamed 'Pumpkinhead' by the local townsfolk, due to it's appearence. ; 2. A nickname for Abobo, a character from the NES game 'Double Dragon'. For the record, Abobo is not an insidious demon. Rather, he's a street thug with a humorously disproportinate head sitting atop his tiny body.
