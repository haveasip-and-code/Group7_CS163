retarded pox
A short-lived attack of retardation which usually occurs in short bursts and is characterized by erratic and irrational movements and speech. One may catch the disease, which will recur throughout one's life at seemingly random moments, by contact with an infected individual. Studies show the disease may be transmitted via aerosol transmission. While infected, the affected individual will rapidly lose brain cells.
