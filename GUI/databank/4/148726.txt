Ahdio Comedy
A wicked cool [radio show] like thing on Myspace. Contains comical audio skits written and preformed by Chris S. Sketches include 'Beano to the Max', 'Skittles Selling Terrorists' and (coming soon) 'Caught By Steve'. Most of the sketches are parodys of popular items, and are slightly crude sometimes, so these are not for the weak of heart. Though if you need a good laugh, I reccomend listening. ; Can be found at ; http://www.myspace.com/ahdiocomedy
