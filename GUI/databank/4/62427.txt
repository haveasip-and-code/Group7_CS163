earth mark two
After Earth was destroyed by Vogons, the people who made it in the first place(because they were looking for the question of Life, the Universe, and Everything)(not the answer) (the question) rebuilt it and named it Earth Mark Two. Well, they STARTED to rebuild it, then they didn't need it anymore....
