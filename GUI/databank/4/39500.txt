thwaps
Crude definition of the female mammory glands. Its origina is close to that of 'Baps' which means the same thing. ; Pronounced 'th-waps' ; Most often used when trying to exemplify how huge or great they are. So baps would be on one level but if desribed as 'thwaps' it takes extra tongue dexterity to pronounce thus more effort thus ramming home the fact that these breasts were far out of this world.
