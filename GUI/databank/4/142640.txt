Retro Babe
A drop-dead gorgeous or scorchingly hot woman who looks like she could have stepped right out of a classic Hollywood film or a vintage pin-up. She can be classy, suggesting someone like Lauren Bacall or Audrey Hepburn or (the young!) Katherine Hepburn, or a sexbomb, like Bettie Page or Jayne Mansfield Pamela Green or Sophia Loren. Her vintage beauty and/or sexiness can be that of any period from the 1920s to the mid-60s. Hippie chicks do NOT count, nor do women whose looks, however attractive, suggest a 70s roller disco queen or an 80s music video.
