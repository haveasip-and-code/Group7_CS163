swimmer
swimmers are the most elite athelites that know how to win. they train multiple hours a day and eat lots of healthy food. they love cold water and dont mind waking up @ 5:15 am to train. they have strong hip flexors, big feet and six packs.they are tan all year round and train in see-through fabric. guys train mostly naked, in fact. they have big muscles and often they can run for long distances, do many pull ups and sit ups etc. they are the most sexually active athelites and because of their strong muscles, they are able to maintain a good rhythm all night long. and everyone who isnt a swimmer is just jealous. well, be jealous.
