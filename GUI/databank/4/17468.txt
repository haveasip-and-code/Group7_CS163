baltimore
One of the best party cities in the world... Well, not if you are: A.) Under 21 and obsessed with letting sweaty yo boys dance all over you; B.)Scared to sit in a cab and have a friendly conversation with your foreign cab driver; or C.)Looking for some sort of 'celebrity encounter'. ; I have lived here my whole life, and I can't imagine being anywhere else. I like to sit at Kisling's and drink a beer while watching the O's kick some Yankee ass on TV. I like walking around the Square (Canton) and jumping into a stool at one of the first bars with their windows open. I LOVE sitting in the cheap seats at Camden Yards cheering on the most underrated team in baseball (just because our payroll isn't ridiculous doesn't mean we aren't good). And I can't imagine missing Sunday night karaoke at Fletcher's with all of my friends. ; Most of these definitions are bashing Baltimore. But if you have lived here, you appreciate all of the little things. So we aren't the safest city... Don't be an idiot and wander into West Baltimore after dark. We might not be the cleanest, but the Inner Harbor collects all of the trash that floats through the freaking bay. But we have history. We are extremely cultured. We are Baltimore, and you aren't going to change that.
