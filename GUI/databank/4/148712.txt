glowstick
A tubular device that exhibits chemoluminescence. Often seen at clubs and raves, can be used in a variety of ways, including on the end of a string, swung in intricate ways to form fluid trails of light. A stick's construction is from clear or frosted or coloured plastic, containing a glass vial of hydrogen peroxide, which is snapped to activate, allowing the chemicals to mix. The rest of the stick is filled with a phenyl oxalate ester and a fluorescent dye that gives coloured light when mixed. ; The glowstick gives off a bright light, and is cold to the touch, making it very safe. It can be used as an emergency light as they are not dependant on a power source, carrying their own.
