CZL
Condition Zero League ; A small league of gamers based on the counter-strike condition zero modification of the popular half-life game. Run by a 15 year old kid out of Canada who has a complete misconception as to how the world works and has stolen most all of his ideas from [CAL]. One of the most poorly run leagues in all of E-Sports and a complete compliment to the way [GameSurge] is run.
