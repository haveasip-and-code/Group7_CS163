Mexi-Goth
Mexican American college kids and grads from Los Angeles and Orange County that dress a hybrid of classic goth black with a Mexican twist and slightly mod. Girls especially in this category will have barrettes in their Sad Girl hair even when they are 40. Mexi-Goths listen to both their mothers and Morrissey and almost always can't speak Spanish.
