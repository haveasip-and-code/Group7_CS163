Ghandi
A lawyer who partially through practices of non-violence and fasting was able to liberate India from British rule. Promoted religious and ethical tolerance, lived like a commoner, and eventually won the Nobel Peace Prize. Was mourned by pretty much everyone in the world when he was assassinated.
