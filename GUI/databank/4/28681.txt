Windshield-Smearing
The act of, either voluntarily or involuntarily, ceasing one's life by being hit with either the front or the rear of a moving vehicle, most commonly a Jeep, but occasionally a military tank, APC, or, in rare cases, a transport helicopter. Most commonly heard of in 'First Person Shooter' games like 'Call of Duty' and 'Command & Conquer: Renegade', but it has been known for this to happen in 'Real-Life'. But in 'Video Games', Windshield-Smearing is sually followed by loud, side-splitting laughter from the 'Smear-er', and loud, audible curses from the 'Smear-ee', both of which will be typed out and posted 'in-Game' after a period of about 30 seconds.
