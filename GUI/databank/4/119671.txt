fountain valley
The most over looked city in [Orange County]. Most people who live in The OC haven't heard of it. For those who don't know, it is between Huntington Beach, Westminister, and Santa Ana. It is home to about 2 [Starbucks] cafes and 20 7-11's. ; Fountain Valley is so small and lame that the town motto is: A nice place to live. ; Yep, stolen straight outta [Back to the Future].
