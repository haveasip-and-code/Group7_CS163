swiss cheese
Term used to define a fake sports fan (usually old and completely unathletic) who is there for the publicity or because their other rich friends went there, and they sit in the club boxes eating swiss cheese and drinking white zinfendel, occassionally clapping for the team when they do something that everyone else claps at.
