bullfighting
A barbaric activity where a baby bull is pushed onto a stage where it is watched by thousands of psychos who enjoy seeing it being tortured. First the bull is weakened with horrible metal spikes and humiliated publically, and just when it thinks things can't get much worse, it is stabbed in the heart by a ponsy Spanish bastard riding a horse. A truly horrible, inhumane and disgusting sport. Oh and by the way, it is not a sport because for something to be a sport there has to be an element of uncertainty. ie, No one knows which team or side will win. In bullfighting, there is just one outcome - the suffering and eventual death of the bull.
