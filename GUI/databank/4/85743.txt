animal
Multi-cellular living organism who can move (unlike [plants]), consume other organisms and who can respond to stimuli from its environnement and who sometimes is able to use tools and even computers. ; Wrongly considered to be majorly different from [humans], as in reality there is no real border between humans, since the history of humanity shows many species going from commonly-considered animals to the modern man, without any real break in the evolution that would show a border between animals and humans. ; Animals are often considered less than what they really are (such as walking-food) and many humans feel insulted when recalled they are animals as indeed it should rather be animals who should feel insulted for being considered so much lower than humans.
