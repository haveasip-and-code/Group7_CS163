Bottom-Dweller
An insult which indicates that the recipient is a member of society's lowest levels. This may have stemmed from Elizabethean times, when the poorer viewers at a theatre had to watch from the ground (hence their nickname, 'Groundlings'), which had no seats. The wealthier atendees, however, had nice chairs and overhangs, preventing them from getting wet.
