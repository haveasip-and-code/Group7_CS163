Trah-bong-site
Street version of the name for a lesser-well-known suburb of Manchester; Longsight. Heavily infested with gangsters and ninjas, a 'lingo' has developed there to fox the authorities. The code may be applied to any word simply by replacing the first consonant of a word with 'Trah' and inserting 'b' before the remaining letters; in words beginning with vowels, simply prefix 'Trah-b...'
