hippie
one who embraces belief in peace love and happiness. some narrowminded sterotypical assholes like to associate them with pot, also know as weed or marijuana. The truth is there are many sub parts of the term hippie. there are college know it all hippies that walk around telling teenagers that they don't know the things that they should know because they havent been to college yet. there are music hippies who like to express themselves through music. there are vegetarian hippies who refuse to eat meat and protest meat eaters. and then of course there are SOME hippies who choose to smoke weed.
