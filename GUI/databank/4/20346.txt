caper
adjective, used to describe a person who belongs to a subculture where capes are acceptable clothing. Hard core fans of Star Trek, role playing games such as Magic the Gathering, science fiction, comic books, Star Wars, and pagans, goths, polyamorous, and others who would wear a cape without irony. Although goths are different from Star Trek convention-goers at first glance, upon close inspection there are many geeky/counterculture/loner similarities and many shared interests among all capers. 'Caper' is a convienent one-word sum up of all such subcultures. Most often, capers travel in a flock. Lone capers often go unnoticed, due to their passive body language and quick flight into solitude or assimilation back into the flock.
