never bring food to a buffet
an expression which basically asserts that it is unnecessary (and often self-defeating) to be accompanied by someone of the opposite sex to an event where there are likely to be a significant amount of unattached people who are potentially looking for an opportunity to '[hook up]'. ; applies of course to those who are not married or not in a steady, long term relationship.
