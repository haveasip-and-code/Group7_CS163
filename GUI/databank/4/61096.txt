sword fight
Also known as a [sausage fest]. Sword fights are parties with an overwhelming amount of males. What few females there are usually being [cock block]ed too. They develop when too many different [clique]s decide to show up, with few females being told of the party. Also, if two parties are being held at the same time, more or less one of them will turn into a sword fight, depending on which people the girls like.
