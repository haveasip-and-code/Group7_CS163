err
Pornography. ; I learned this today. My friends told me about it. I assume they made it up. Its just a nice, discrete way of talking about porn. We had a conversation about Limewire and porno right in front of a teacher and she was oblivious. 'Porno' has a way of attracting attention, but a nice soft 'err' avoids that unwanted attention.
