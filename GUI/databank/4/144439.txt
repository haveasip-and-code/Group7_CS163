Redding
Want mansions, trees, and alcohol- try Redding. Full of preppy kids, their 'ghetto' counterparts, and the drug-loving [Easton]ites who inevitably influence quite a few Reddingites to join in a game of 'ruit or a smoke around the really expensive car -or in it (Hotboxing). Currently at the Redding-Easton public high school (Joel Barlow) there are quite a few cars priced over the average starter home, including 3 BMW i-series, an Escalade or two(one black and one white), a yellow H-2, a few wranglers with a couple sporting the necessary snowplow and enlarged tires, and, of course, the Audi. Everyone at Barlow wears either a polo, a Northface, and American Eagle (with a side of Birkenstocks and pot) or black, black, black, and more black. Oh yes, and the occasional 'bootylicious' wanna-bee and the kids that come to school so wasted they have forgotten to change their clothes for days.
