(y)egative
the true opposite of [(n)egative]. it means '[good]'. ; the opposite of [(n)egative] is commonly believed to be [(a)ffirmative] or [(p)ositive]. however if you believe this you are a dumbass because that would be a picture of an angel or some random miscellaneous camera-type object, not a thumbs-up. YOU ARE WRONG. (y)egative is the true solution. ; it looks like a [thumbs up] with 'egative' on the end..
