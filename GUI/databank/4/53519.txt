avril lavigne
Avril is NOT a poser! How can she be a poser when she is writng her own songs and wearing the clothes she likes? She is very inspirational to a lot of people because she came from a small town in canada and is now famous all over the world. All of her fans aren't 10 yr old girls because i know a lot of 15 yr olds who like her music. She never said she was punk and just because she doesnt know who the sex pistols are doesn't mean she's a poser. She has tried hard to keep her image real to herself and fights for what she thinks is right. She is just a normal 20 yr old and doesnt need sad people saying things about her. Not that she gives a f*ck. Also she is engaged to sum 41 singer deryk whibley.
