vw golf
A quality hatch back car, you need to slam it on Porsche rims, slap a classic roof rack on for a bit of retro class and top it all off with a 20v 1.8 Turbo. All shit heads in cheap nasty modified cars will try to race you, so slam the loud peddle to the floor, and show that fool what the back of your car looks like.
