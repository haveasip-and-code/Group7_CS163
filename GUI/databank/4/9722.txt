terminator
1: A movie that spanned 3 sequels with the first and third being the worst, and with a dead franchise. ; 2: A bunch of rusted metal bones with a shitty-ass processor, lame red eyes that don't scare even a baby, crappy ass robot wrongfully defined as a cyborg as it only uses living tissue to look like a human. It got the shit ripped out of itself by one of the coolest cyborgs named RoboCop, and unlike RoboCop, it can easily be destroyed by vaporizing its CPU or its power supply. ; 3: A bunch of junk metal parts joined together by some wires, bad quality hydraulic pistons, and incapable of intelligence or good use by humanity. ; Unlike RoboCop, it is not a Cyborg, it is not lame, it is easy to program and make it do stupid shit, It sucks ass compared to RoboCop (who kicks ass and kicked its ass in the RVT comic with Robocop destroy both it and Skynet), and it is not a bunch of walking pieces of junk metal. ; 4: A movie in which part 1 and 3 were lame and shitty (with the first being somewhat more decent than the third because it had Linda Hamilton) and in which the third movie made no sense and the abilities of the female T-X were extremely overdone and lame, totally sending the already shitty Terminator franchise to its total and final collapse. And a movie whos franchise (unlike RoboCop's) totally died with no hopes of return...
