Nigga stole my bike!
Originally a pic from the NES game [Punch-Out], the picture dipected the events in between each tournament where Little Mac would jog through New York and his trainer, Doc Louis, would be leading him on a bike. One day, someone at [Something Awful] decided to take the picture and add the caption 'Nigga stole my bike!' as a contribution to the photoshop contest of that week. This picture soon spread to [YTMND], where it was placed on a web page with a sound clip of a person saying 'Nigga stole my bike!' over and over again. Soon, variations were churned out almost daily, creating an Internet sensation that proved racism could still be funny...for a while.
