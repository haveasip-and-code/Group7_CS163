Seal
S,E,A,L. (not to be confused and/or misguided) ; a Seal is a highly-trained special forces singer of the Music Industry. Part of the K,I,S,S and higher than FROMAROSE. Seal is pretty much a modern-day ninja, a renagade,if you will; he is trained to steal YOUR heart with his allagator chomps on the cheeks. He could easily make a supersonic man out of you. His shiny head is already melt to scenery and he can make a plate of mac-n-cheese-un-noticed. On Stage, he 'blows' away any contender beyond human-conception.
