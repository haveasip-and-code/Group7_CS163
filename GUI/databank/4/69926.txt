Norwalk
I've always looked at it as being boring, living here all of my life, but it is alright. It isn't very dangerous, quite safe in most suburban residential areas. Some areas, though, have rising crime rates. ; Contrary to popular belief, Norwalk is an extremely diverse town. One side of Norwalk could be completely different from the other side. Norwalk is NOT a ghetto, although certain parts of South Norwalk can be counted as a ghetto. Some of South Norwalk can be extremely culturally diverse and interesting. ; East Norwalk is what you would think as a suburban part of Norwalk. It contains many suburban homes and schools convieniently located around the middle of the residential area. ; Yes, there are traditional 'preps' in Norwalk, but most of them are nouveau riche preps who go to country clubs such as Shore and Country and Shorehaven. Also, there are the various cliques.
