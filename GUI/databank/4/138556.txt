Primer Party
Party held in dorm room or apartment downtown early on a Friday night, usually around 6:00pm. These were held to 'Prime' [pregame]yourself for a night of drinking. It is always easier to get a good buzz on before heading out to the bars, than to spend $4.00 for a bottle of bud when you can get a suitcase for $20.00
