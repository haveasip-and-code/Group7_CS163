Look under the cap
A contest occasionally held by companies such as [Coca-Cola] and [Pepsi]. What you must do is under the cap of your drink, you must retreive the tab concealed under it. This is the difficult part. Many nails and pencils have been broken in this process. Best performed with scissors, keys, or a ballpoint pen. When retreived, the tab almost always says 'Please try again', although on occasion the looker-under-the-cap will win a free Pepsi/Coke/whatever product obtainable at most retail outlets. And on rare occasions, you might even win a big prize like concert tickets or an iPod. However, this is not very common.
