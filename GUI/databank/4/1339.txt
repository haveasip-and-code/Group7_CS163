Quiff
Popularized mostly by 50s Rockabillys, a quiff is basically a forelock that is longer than the rest of one's hair on top, and is usually combed upwards (and back), or to the side, or made to hang over the forehead. ; Depending on the wearers hair type a spot of gel or grease may be in order. Very stylish & manly. If done properly. ; The quiff is often worn as a variation or 'evolution' on the very simple (and very manly) crew cut, or with the (longer & back-combed) 'duck's arse' or DA hairstyle. ; Called a 'banane' in French, for obvious reasons.
