fued
Somebody on a message board, mostly wrestling ones, showing their level of intellect by talking about two wrestlers having a 'fued', rather than a [feud] which they are actually having. ; Normally I wouldn't mind, but it seems there are hundreds of people that can't spell the damn word right, so I'm doing them a favour.
