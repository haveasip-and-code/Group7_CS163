Calimocho
noun. A drink of Spanish origin composed of red wine and cola, most frequently in a 1:1 ratio. A sweet wine is preferred over dry, the cheaper the better. For a more swift route to intoxication, a higher concentration of wine should be used. Should be consumed in large quantities in anywhere from a lax to off-the-walls social environment. Highly recommended for use in drinking games.
