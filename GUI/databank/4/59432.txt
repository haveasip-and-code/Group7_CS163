Church of Mod
Founded by [Romuel]. The Church believes that [Lanzer] created our world, and has made some users extensions of his adminly will. These former mortals are known as Mods, and it is their job to protect us from the evil forces of misplaced threads and spam. ; We have a responsibility as users, however, to uphold and follow the Terms of Service. All who do this will be allowed into the Casino when [The Beta] comes. ; See also: [Modist]; [Modista]
