Merry Wright
Merry Wright is a crazy critter who likes to eat small berries and various shrubbery. She lives in a small wooden lean-too and says things like 'chuh' and 'heehee' Merry has luscious free-flowing golden hair and a button nose. She runs wild in the trees and loves all the forest's creatures.
