rawvera
Real name: Riviera beach, the RAWest city in Palm Beach County, FL. Rawvera is located just north of West Palm Beach, and just west of Singer Island. Take a trip through the raw and you will encounter the ever-colorful hood, industrial parks, and an extremely dense population of nerds at the smartest school in the county, Suncoast Community High School for the terminally gifted.
