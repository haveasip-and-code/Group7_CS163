Boozing Braggers
Adult males, in their 20's, clearly over the legal drinking age, who still feel the need to drink competitively and brag about it. They often make mention of there drinking accomplishments including how late they stayed out or more specifically, how much alcohol they drank. Usually, these males grew up in suburban towns across the U.S. They usually didn't taste their first beer until their freshman year of college and didn't get drunk until their first spring break while watching girls gone wild.
