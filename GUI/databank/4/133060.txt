hawaii
Hawaii's a pretty cool place, if you like Asians and Quicksilver. It's funny, though, because basically everyone here is Japanese. Or at least part Japanese. Everyone is about 195701976 ethnicities, so there isn't much racial discrimination. Except against haoles. Which means white person. We're kind of backwards like that. In Hawaii, you gotta speak pidgen English.
