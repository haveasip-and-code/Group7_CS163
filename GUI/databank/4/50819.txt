Rock Lee
With the huge eyebrows and the kick ass style of fighting (Gouken), Rock Lee is the Taijutsu master of all the genin in Naruto. However his luck is really bad as he always ends up fighting people who are particularlly immune to Taijutsu, like Gaara and Kimmimaro. Oh yeah, he one he gets drunk he'll kick your ass ten times more then normal.
