hip hop
Hip hop is a culture, or a lifestyle if you wish. ; the term '4 elements' was coined when there was still only 4 elements; ; bboyin (not break dancing) which could mean break boy or beat boy or bronx boy depending on where you live. ; emceeing, which used to be shoutouts and such later evolved into 'rapping' and no thats not what 50 cent does because 50 cent is a sellout loser that sings bout his imagineary 'hoes'. ; Djing or turntablism, this started by them just replaying the break bits in funk songs so that bboys could get down, and breakbeats was the first hiphop music ('evolved' from funk music.) ; Graffiti, i dont know much about this but its visual art. ; The 4 elements was a good concept for a while, but hip hopp grew and became more than 4 elements, making this term invalid.
