core
(Shit). It is something to add to a music style that will be a guarantee the music is (horrendous) shit. ; Usually has melodic guitars like U2 but will in addition have some 21-year-old college-drop-out, I-scream-out-of-key-to-be-cool, frontman... The singer will then proceed to sing very (emo) and confuse the audience with giving them a sound that makes them think 'not bad, its actually pretty good now,' and then he will then proceed to scream again out of key, and make everyone in the audience wish they never experimented with 'Core' style music.
