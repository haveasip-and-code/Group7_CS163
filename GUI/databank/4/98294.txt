Wellesley
Wellesley: a.k.a. East Coast Beverley Hills. People over 30 drive Benz's and Beemers, the kids usually drive expensive suv's and most are equipped with expensive systems no hood rat could dream of 'boostin''. For the most part high schoolers own the cops and although they break up parties, no one usually gets in trouble, cause lets face it, our parents pay their salaries. Kids wear only the most expensive clothes, consisting of polo, burberry, lily and juicy. We do what we want and parents simply don't care. If you hate your life, its cause you're not from Wellesley.
