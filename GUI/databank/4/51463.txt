No-Wave
No-wave is a genre of music that's name takes the [mickey] out of the stereotyping that occurs every day, mainly within the teen popular culture. An example of this stereotyping is: ; Mark: what's with Matt these days he's listening to a lot of [Senses Fail] and [Hawthorne Heights]? ; Mike: yeh it's all just a load of emo shit ; Mark:...mmmmmmmm... so true ; This stereotyping occurs because these bands, however good or bad they are, can so easily defined as a certain style. Styles such as metal, punk, classic rock,[new-wave] jazz, r&b and emo are commonly discussed, which actually gets REALLY annoying. So anyway, No-Wave is a name used for a hard-to-define, broad genre of music that came about in NYC late 70's-ish. Bands such as Sonic Youth, Fugazi and Helmet are commonly known as typical No-Wave bands and have been very successful because of their open minded approach to rock music.
