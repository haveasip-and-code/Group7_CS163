B2K
A group of 4 fine young men who made beautiful music together and whom can never be duplicated nor replaced in any way shape or form. B2K= Omarion, J-Boog, Lil Fizz, and Raz-B. They were phenominal dancers and singers and will always be the best boy band of the 21st century and EVER!! They were hella funny. Boys 4 Life WILL come true with a little more time.
