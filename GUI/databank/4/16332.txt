Parker Kenpo
A style of kenpo karate created by Mr.Parker. Compared to other styles it's relatively young. The defense techniques are based on the predetermined actions of the attacker. Some people think that parker kenpo is 'safe' because it the techniques have a check system unlike some other arts where the first or second strike must take down the opponent.
