Sweet Tea
Made from Orange Pekoe Tea leaves this non-alcoholic beverage, served cold and moslty below the [Mason Dixon line] is a Southerners favorite treat on a hot day (or with pork [BBQ]). Sugar is added at the time just after brewing 'while the tea is still hot'. This allows the sugar to disolve more evenly and produces a fine treat. Can be garnished with a Lemon. (See also [Ice Tea])
