Latte Liberals
'Liberals' who have nothing better to do than to join fashionable causes. ; This term derives from liberals who sit around and drink overpriced diluted Starbucks coffee while lamenting the plight of the poor. ; Latte Liberals have no sense of discretion and usually forget what they're arguing about soon after other latte liberals judge newer causes (polygamy, discrimination against left-handers, etc.) to be more worthy. ; Note contrast to [cornflake conservative]
