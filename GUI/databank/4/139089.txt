La Bon
When a man's image is so feminine and overly quaffed, that they end up looking like Simon La Bon from the 80's new-wave band Duran Duran. Though anything similar works as well, looking like any member of a new-wave band can be La Bon i.e.: Michael Score of 'a Flock of Seagulls' and Limahl of 'Kajagoogoo'.
