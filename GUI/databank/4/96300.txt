-ey
Geeks/nerds and some other people on the internet like to add -ey to the end of a word to signify that the subject bears resemblance or is somehow simmillar to that word. Only used where -ey is not a propper suffix to the word, or as a double. Also used by retards who don't realize that they are using slang. (They think that the -ey is supposed to be there)
