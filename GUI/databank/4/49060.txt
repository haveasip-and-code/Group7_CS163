full count
the full count is a variation on the shocker. the pinky and ring finger are inserted into a woman's ass while the middle finger, index finger, and thumb of the same hand are inserted into her vagina. this is called a full count because of the distribution of the fingers, three in one hole, two in the other. it is a reference to a three ball, two strike count in baseball, called a full count. the term is also appropriate because the woman, upon the execution of the full count, is full of fingers. you must be especially dexterous to perform the full count. it requires an awkward and difficult positioning of the fingers.
