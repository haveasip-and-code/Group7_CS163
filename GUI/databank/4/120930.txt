open road salute
A gesture used by motorcyclists to pay homage to one another at rallies, shows, and events focusing on motorcycles; performed by extending both hands outward in front of the body, with hands clenched as if holding motocycle handlerbars, typically accompanied by a nodding of the head, as if to communicate acknowledgement. Can be referred to as ORS.
