PartyTrain Soldier (R.A.D)
Mostly native to Philadelphia and surrounding areas, this species survives on afterhours bars, Urban Outfitters and Puma clothing, Open [SPARKS] bars, and the rare partytrainanthem dance beats. The term 'soldier' is utilized to keep away non-rad-party-poopers. Easily spotted in coffeeshops, vintage stores, and record stores, provided they think they have a good haircut.
