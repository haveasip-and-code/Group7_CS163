Dooms Day Device
The fictional device that the Russians had in [Dr. Strangelove] that would automatically set off if the USA ever attacked the Soviet Union. It's detination would destroy the entire world. The reasoning was that it was a whole lot cheaper to make it and threaten the world then try to keep up in Arms Race, Space Race and Peace Race against the USA.
