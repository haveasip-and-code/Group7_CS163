cacodemon
A horrible and terrifying enemy seen in every [Doom] computer game yet, the cacodemon was not seen originally until approximately halfway through the first game. The cacodemons were originally red floating cycloptic spheres, but got an extreme makeover for [Doom 3]. Fast, very powerful, hard to kill, along with the fact that they often attack in swarms or close quarters, or in the shade where you can't see them, are the main reasons why the cacodemons remain a favorite enemy of many fans to this day... and what made them the worst enemies to face other than bosses.
