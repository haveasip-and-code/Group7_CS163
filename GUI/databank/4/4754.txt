Dining at the Y
Humorous way to allude to the kind of menu you will be having for tonite's dinner. You will probably choose some [tuna taco] , or perhaps [bearded clam] or maybe [loose meat sandwich] or even some [snapper]. ; For those who need further explanation, the diner is called the Y not because its in some gym, but due to the peculiar shape of all aforementioned dishes.
