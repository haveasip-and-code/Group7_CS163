Pretty cool place overall. If you can't decide between backpacking in SE Asia or joining a frat, then do the east coast of Oz. Heard the West coast is amazing but didn't make it personally. Watch out for schoolies in Byron. ; In person, Aussies are incredibly friendly. For some reason though whenever an aussie posts online they turn into raving america-hating lunatics. We Canucks tend to do it sometimes too, but have earned the right for obvious reasons. ; As friendly as Aussies are I tend to prefer Kiwis for friendliness and general backwardness. Aussies remind me of Canadians and Kiwis remind me of Newfies. ; Negative: Evil a.k.a. Rupert Murdoch is from there.
