HBO
1. Home Box Office, a quality channel airing shows such as The Sopranos and Sex and the City, as well as Oz. ; 2. Something my manager at [McDonalds] used to yell out randomly. Stands for 'Hang Bag Out', a technique used in the drive-thru to reduce customer wait times. Normally you'd hang the bag(s) of food out as the person pulls up to the window so they don't have to wait forever for their order.
