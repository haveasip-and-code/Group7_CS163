khat
Drug heavily used in some Middle-Eastern and African countries. Consumed either through chewing the leaf like coca-leaves or brewed as tea after being dried. Results in feeling of euphoria and increased concentration (used by many students for 'studying' purposes). Resembles caffeine, but is illegal in the US. However, no one cares.
