Democratic Underground
A wonderland/safehouse for frustrated Democrats needing to vent and surround themselves in similar company. Also a decent place to find thorough, if slanted, coverage of all the wacky goings-on in the world of neo-conservatism. Democratic Underground is significant in that it was one of the first organizations to really dig in and unearth the details regarding the Jeff Gannon controversy. Must-reads on Democratic Underground include the hilariously scathing Top 10 Conservative Idiots, Equal Time With Bob Boudelang, and The Crisis Papers. Their Hate Mail section is also of note because complete decay of your faith in humanity can be fun.
