A now defunct p2p application that contained a questionable command to delete files on the users computer and coupled with the forum administrators consistent lies and over exaggerations lead to it's quick demise. This application had great potential as an anonymous p2p client, but was rejected by the p2p community for it's lack of documentation (closed source) and the trolling efforts of a few members of their forums.
