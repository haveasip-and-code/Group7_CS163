stanford university
One of the best universities in the US. Incredibly open-minded and decidedly saturated with that wonderful California liberalism. The girls are better than people say, and the guys are either really hott or ugly like woah. We also party pretty hard here... trust me :). Athletics and academics are premier. Pretty much the best place on the earth.
