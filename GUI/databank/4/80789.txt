nepman
NEP-man. A capitalist pig, slacker, and over all scoundrel. This term was used to describe the entrepreneurs who profited from the new economic policy (NEP) that was introduced after the Russian civil war. Since the NEP was seen as contrary to the revolution, being called a nepman (or woman) was a grievous insult in Bolshevik Russia.
