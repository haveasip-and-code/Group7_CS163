FUMA
Military school in the middle of nowhere, Virginia, for guys from the ages of 12 to 18. Service doesn't reach cell phones and there isn't a single traffic light in town. Students are completely shut off from the opposite sex, and unless a special occasion, girls are not aloud to walk around campus. They march when they are bad, and at 150 demerits, they are kicked out. ; Oh yeah, and the guys are really nice. they've been gentleman-ized.
