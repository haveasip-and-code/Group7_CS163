Bush-Basher
A typical punk-rocker or emo-rocker teen who have been manipulated by the media and a lot of today's culture (mainly music and TV). They also do this because they either have no life, or they want to bash and challenge their leaders and/or the authorites to make themselves feel big, or sometimes just for kicks.
