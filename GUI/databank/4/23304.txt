raiders
An NFL team and fashion phenomenon from Oakland, California (a real dump of a town by the way, it is inhabited mostly by people who moved there from Stockton to 'make it' and will be moving back to Stockton again in a few months or so). This team is more famous for it's merchandise and logo than for its skill on the football field. While there are a lot of die hard, psychotic fans with fetishes for spikes and chain mail who are very in touch with the team and the sport, the average person you see wearing Raider gear hasn't the first clue about football, the team, or the spirit of the Raider nation.
