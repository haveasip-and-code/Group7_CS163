ganking
An imaginary means of killing someone 'unfairly' in WoW. ; Ganking, by definition of the game is quite impossible, because killing people of the enemy faction in any way, even if looked down upon is the object of the game. ; If ganking wasn't the intention of the developers, it would be taken out. Plain and simple.
