Tricky bag
A gear bar or duffel frequently carried by police. The contents of the bag can include extra ammo, snack food, a sweater, or any other equipment that supplements the cops issued gear, makes his work more comfortable, or prepares him for that unknown encounter that most cops fear. Probably from the spanish word 'trique' which loosely translates to stuff.
