Gwen Stefani
A strangely pale popstar who insists on wearing bright red lipstick and maintaining platinum blonde hair to make her look even paler. Was once the singer in a band called No Doubt in which she demonstrated far more musical talent than in her new soloist songs. 'If I was a Rich Girl' probably reflects what she was thinking when she was stuck with her bandmates who could probably make tons more on their own than her. Catchy songs though. <3
