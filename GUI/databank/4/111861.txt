MDA
Common nomenclature for 3,4-Methylenedioxy-Amphetamine. Related to MDMA (Ecstasy) but different, at least effects-wise. Basically it's like rolling but much less tactile (usually no full body orgasms like X), and less empathetic and lovey-dovey. On the other hand, it gives a powerful feeling of euphoria and bliss, gives you some crazy visuals, and enhances music to an INSANE degree. The music enhancement is the reason that some DJs prefer it to MDMA. Most often found in commercial ecstasy pills, passed off as MDMA. Occasionally some lone-wolf chemist will make a bunch for themselves and their friends.
