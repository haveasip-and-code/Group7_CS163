Hereford
One would define Hereford in several different ways. There\'s the obvious: Hereford High School, the school in Northern Baltimore County with one of the best agriculture programs in the state. One would also define it as a way of life: taking pride in your state champ football team, your high overall SAT scores, being a Hereford Bull, joing the firehall and leaving class to go on fire calls, going to cattle shows, sleeping in barns on haystacks, smoking during lunch down at Bunker Hill, The Dip, the Bull Run.. the list will forever go on. Hereford is also a way of life: once you\'re here, you\'re lucky to get out.
