sifter
sifter n. ; [Middle English siften, from Old English siftan] ; Through a uniquely New Zealand south island experience, sifter has come to mean much more. A somewhat sarcastic twist on the first NZ usage (being to search for meaning); it is 'doing stuff' so long as that stuff has no bearing on a career, paid work, community work, ; Wanaka is now home to many fine exponents of the sifting way.
