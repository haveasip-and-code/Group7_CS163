Monmouth University
Community collge with a price tag on it. Modified high school. A school that punishes students that plagiarize with a B instead of an A. A school that gives out A's to prevent girls from crying. A school that will cost you an arm and a leg to go to for a worthless education. Only local rich kids will attend the school. And, no, the sports teams aren't any good. It's not hard to be on the top of a division that consists of reject high school players.
