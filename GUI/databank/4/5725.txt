castrati
males who were castrated before puberty so that they could be trained to play feminine roles in plays and operas in the 18th century. The tonal quality of the castrati was so pure that the castrated youths were in great demand as performers. Many famous composers of the era wrote operatic parts especially for the voices of the castrati.
