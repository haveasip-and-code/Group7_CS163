Anarchism
NOT as many people think simply not having a government and hierachy, but a PEACEFUL HARMOIOUS state where people are educated to think for themselves. ; Most people see this as unworkable because they don't see the second half. Afghanistan, for example is not properly anarchic, as warlords etc still fight to control land. If only they could see how much happier we'd all be if we got along and took time to understand each other....
