Curse of the A-Rod
The hypothetical curse that befell the Yankees as soon as they signed Alex Rodriguez, sending their payroll to over $200 mil. Their All-Star 1st baseman suffered from steroid withdrawal and maybe a pituitary tumor. Roger Clemens had a dominant year in Houston. Bernie became the worst defensive CF in the league. And then, the 2004 ALCS, the biggest choke job in sports history, in which Mariano became mortal and A-Rod showed his cheating whiny bitch glove-slapping soul to the world.
