cheeseweasel
The cartoon character created by Jim Ridings. But even before that, April 3rd has always been a public holiday in some places because it is Cheeseweasel Day. He is said to put Cheese under your computer keyboard every year on April 3rd, but only for the good girls and boys. He also has a song, which can be downloaded from the main Cheeseweasel Website. The cheeseweasel has many websites, but I cannot mention the URL because that would be advertising.
