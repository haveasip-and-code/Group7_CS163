ten page syndrome
When you are writing a huge important paper that is supposed to be 15-20 pages, and somewhere around the tenth page, you start feeling like a) you are never going to finish this goddamn paper, b)everything you have written so far is total crap and makes no sense. Generally results in a paper-writing break that may include curling up in a ball and sobbing. Occurs with higher frequency at the end of the semester. Only known cure is actually getting off your ass and working. Ten page syndrome may persist until you are a page or two away from your minimum, when it will be replaced by elation and a second wind of energy.
