Shaq Fu
Possibly the greatest game of all time. Many have tried to emulate the awesomeness of Shaq Fu, but have come up short every time. It is a fighting game, and as the name suggests, it stars Shaq, the center on the team of righteousness. His task is to go into another dimension, save some kid he doesn't even know, and beat the hell out of anyone who stands in his way. Awesome game. To get the full Shaqtastic experience when playing this game, I would suggest playing some of Shaq's rap songs at the same time, as well as having a Miami Heat, or old Lakers or Magic game on every other tv in the house.
