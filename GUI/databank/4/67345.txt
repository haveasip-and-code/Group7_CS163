The Dutch
Crazy thieving bastards, the Dutch steal everyones music and then keep it on their 600GB RAID clusters, rebroadcast it to their mile long MSN lists, and have over 1000 live sets and about half as many live videos of hard dance festivals. If you ever need a game or piece of software cracked, go see the Dutch. They will have what you need. ; The End.
