John Rzeznik
Born in Buffalo, NY on the 5th of December 1965 to polish immigrants, John Rzeznik grew up to become the frontman of The Goo Goo Dolls. That started out playing punk covers in bars and slowly worked their way to become one of America's best-recognized bands. John would play the guitar and sing alongside his best friend, Robby Takac, who was one of the band's co-founders. With time he began writing lyrics to show that he could write truly inspiring songs using very simple means. He was the author of The Goo Goo Dolls's greatest hits: 'Name', 'Slide' and 'Iris'. Many a time has John shown his sociopolitical side, contributing to many charity events and supporting political movements.
