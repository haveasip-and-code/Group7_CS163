wicky wicky
A phrase used by my girlfriend to describe hip-hop often broadened to describe any form of music(noteably those associated with [decks]) that I like and which she doesnt ie drum'n'bass, trance, trip-hop, hardcore, old skool... ; thank god she likes punk and ska or it could just get nonsensical. ; Now adopted by most people we know to describe hip-hop music especially that with fine examples of turntablism. ; Ok perhaps a tad personal (but more people should start using it!) I anticipate a removal.
