emo chick
Goths who are too cool to be goth. ; They like music where the lead singer has been kicked in the balls one too many times. ; Faces are usually horrifically disfigured so they cover it with hair. ; Atleast, this is what I'm lead to believe. ; While to be 'emo' you're supposed to act depressed, emo chicks actually act kind of perky. ; In this way they're like preps but with pretty scars.
