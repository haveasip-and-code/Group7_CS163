dc101
It's one of the better radio stations in the Maryland or DC area. A good bit of Alternative, some Hard Rock, and a little bit of Hip Hop/Rap is played on this FM station. Some of their favorite bands are Alice in Chains, System of a Down, Metallica, Janes Addiction, and Nirvana. The rap groups that you would hear on this fine radio station are House of Pain and the Beastie Boys. ; DC 101 is very similar to the WHFS 99.1 before they changed formats from Alternative to Salsa or some BS. Do not listen to DC 101 after 10pm on Saturdays unless you want to listen to the worst mash ups of all time. The segment is called Flounder's Mash Ups and they SUCK!
