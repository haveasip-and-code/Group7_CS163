TRIRIGA
A disaster of unprecedented mediocrity. Consisting of multiple independent failures that overlap in a symphonic cacophony of destruction. Often seen in cinema as a dark comedy where disaster could have been averted at any point, but because of repeated mistakes on the part of the protagonists, failure is inevitable.
