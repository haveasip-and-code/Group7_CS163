keep your pecker up
This phrase means 'Cheer up' or 'Don't worry, stay happy!' but I understand that it can cause howls of laughter in certain circles, I can't think why! ; The pecker in question is probably not a penis, I think it may come from Woody Woodpecker? Or possibly pecker meaning your beak so equating to looking up?
