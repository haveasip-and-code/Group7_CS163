yaoi
A Japanese abbreviation for 'YAmanashi, Ochinashi, Iminashi' which translates to 'without climax, without resolution, without meaning,' and by the Japanese definition refers to [doujinshi] that support a non-[canon], [homosexual] (male/male) couple and are very explicit. ; In English terms, however, the word is much more broad and can refer to anything with any [homosexual](only male/male) or boy's love themes in anime and [manga], sometimes even expanding to non-anime/[manga] works, but often in connection with [fanfiction].
