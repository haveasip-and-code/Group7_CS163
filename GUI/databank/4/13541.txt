commies
A communist. Usually someone who follows the philosophy of Carl Marx, or Lenin (Albeit built on Marx). Lenin's book, 'Imperialism:The Highest Stage of Capitalism' is one of the most widely read communist texts. It attacks capitalism and explores ways in which social equity can occur. ; Unfortunately Communism as a rule of government does not and probably never will work, as it gives the Government corrupting power. It is a pure contradiction that Russia, Cuba, China and North Korea call(ed) themselves communists, yet all were/are ruled by a dictator. ; For this reason equally oppressive figures (to that of the dictators) attacked communism, such as Mcarthy. And henceforth such derogatory terms as '[sneaky] [commie] [rat]' will forever be utilized by the [ignorant] public, such as the [idiot] who posted prior to me.
