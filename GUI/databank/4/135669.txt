channel surfing
The act of changing TV channels without finding a channel to stop on. Pressing the up or down button on the TV remote control while hoping to find something worth watching. This involuntary muscle reaction is triggered by the commercial. Sometimes the act of channel surfing becomes entertainment in and of itself. From the concept of a spending time doing tricks on a board shaped device. For males of the species, it is possible simultaneously watch two or three programs and still follow the weak attempt at a plot.
