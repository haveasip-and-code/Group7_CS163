Cardcaptors
Basically is [Card Captor Sakura] horribly dubbed into English.The 70 episodes of [Card Captor Sakura] were cut to 38.It's horrible.The names were changed,the dubbing is horrible,the characters now look like retards,even the nice opening Catch You Catch Me was changed in an horrible song!!!!!See.Some Examples: ; [Sakura Kinomoto]:Sakura Avalon ; Li-Syaoran or Li-kun:Li Showron(it sounds like moron for me)or JUST Li ; Meiling:Meilin ; Kero-chan:Kero ; Yukito:Julian!!!o.o ; Tomoyo:Madison!!O.O ; Nelvana cut some things,like for example a scene with Li-kun eating chocolate,or Sakura melting for Yukito.... ; In conclusion,it's an abomination compared to the great [Card Captor Sakura]
