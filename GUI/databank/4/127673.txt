xenimus
Is addictive will ruin the kindness in you mind if you dont find pure friends, and best way to quit is give away all the good stuff you have to someone less fortunate. i gave away one omni set . omni bow, many vts. and got omni set stolen due to my kindness. hey atleast im dont play xenimus anymore. im glad, but i still canntot find a job/ goto school. and gotten into more trouble than id owuld of id stay on xen. but things happen and xen is not for me. as for now. or maybe ill try it again.
