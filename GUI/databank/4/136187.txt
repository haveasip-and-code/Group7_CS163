musicoholic
A musicoholic is a person who's life revolves around mucic. If you listen to mucic in the shower, whil'st sleeping, while eating, or just plain listening to music while doing nothing, if you do all of the above, you are a muscioholic. You think about musci all day, you think about listening to it, going to concerts, buying a CD. Everything you do has music involved in it.
