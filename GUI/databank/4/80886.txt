South Boston  VA
Small town where everyone knows everyone. An all around wonderful place to grow up, where one never sees absolute poverty or extradornary wealth. It is where one has a past, present, and furture with friends and family. A place where it is common to have known someone since birth, and go from the preschool thru college with someone.
