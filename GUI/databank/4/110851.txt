Second Avenue Subway
The result of left-leaning transportation policy that effectively stole the systems built by the BRT (BMT predecessor and Pennsylvania Railroad affiliate) and the IRT by Mayor John 'Red Mike' Hylan--all over the nickel fare. It took less than 30 years to build the complete IRT and BMT subway and El systems, less than 10 to build the IND, and forever to construct a simple two-track subway under Second Avenue. Ohhh, had the Ellsberg Law never been passed...
