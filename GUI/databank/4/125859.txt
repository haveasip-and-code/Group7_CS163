Gates of Hell
An amazing place up in North Jersey. It is a large tunnel network that supposedly ends at the gates of hell. It has been featured in Weird NJ, best local magazine. Also known for the intermingling of cultists and bored suburbian youth that frequent the tunnels. (PS Ignore Warning Signs, you can all swim I hope)
