truthiness
The quality of stating concepts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than the facts. ; Origin: Stephen Colbert, 'The Colbert Report,' 2005 ; 'And that brings us to tonight's word: truthiness. ; 'Now I'm sure some of the Word Police, the wordanistas over at Webster's, are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word.' Well, anybody who knows me knows that I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true, or what did or didn't happen. Who's Britannica to tell me the Panama Canal was finished in 1914? If I wanna say it happened in 1941, that's my right. I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart.'
