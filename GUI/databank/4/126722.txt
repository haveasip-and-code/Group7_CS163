monkephant
a monkephant is a mammal that has the size and long nose of an elephant and the fur, tail and aposable thumbs of a monkey. Monkephants can be found in their native homeland deep in the equatorial rainforests of Africa eating [bananana]s and swinging from trees while creating much havoc. Monkephants do NOT make good househeld pets. Ever.
