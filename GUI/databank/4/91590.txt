Art Of Noise
Art Of Noise were a brilliant group of musicians who made music from sampled sounds stored on their Fairlight sampler. Couple that with some synthesizers and a simmons electronic drum kit and the genius of J.J Jezalik and Anne Dudley, then you have the best sound your ears will ever experience.
