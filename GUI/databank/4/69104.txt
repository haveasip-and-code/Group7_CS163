a usually offensive slang term used by a totally non-hip German teacher (that is actually Danish) to andother totally non-hip or shall i say cool, science teacher name miss Sloan. ; The term is now used as a reversal compliment and can easily offend someone if spoken the right way, which is in a deep, smoky Mrs. koler type of talk.
