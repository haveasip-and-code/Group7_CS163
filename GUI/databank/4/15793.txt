rolls canardly
A fancy-sounding yet affectionate name for a car that is even less functional than a [hoopty]. A car might be called this because 'it rolls down one hill, and canardly get up the next'. ; Exact origin unknown, but it is a pun on [Rolls Royce], a particular expensive make of motor vehicle, and 'Canardly', I believe a make of small passenger aircraft.
