dolomite
The human tornado. Dolomite is quite possibly one of the better/more stereotypical characters to come out of the 70's genre of [blacksploitation] films. Part pimp, part crime fighting/crimemaking super hero, Dolomite cannot be killed by conventional weapons- ala Keith Richards. ; Not to be confused with [Shaft], [Super Fly] or any other mere mortal black actors. Played so elequently by Rudy Ray Moore, Dolomite will [bust a cap] in yo ass, run from the [honky] ass po-lice and otherwise find sick ways of killing you, maiming you and fucking yo' [bitch.]
