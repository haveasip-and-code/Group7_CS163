B5
A boy group signed to P. Diddy's Bad Boy Records. Consists of five brothers: Dustin, Kelly, Patrick, Carnell, and Bryan. They currently reside in the crunk capitol of the world, Atlanta, Georgia. The guys can sing and, as Diddy himself said, 'Dance they asses off.' The name 'B5' comes from their last name, Breeding. Oh, and they're pretty cute, too.
