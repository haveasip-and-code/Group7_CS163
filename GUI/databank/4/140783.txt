blaps
A term commonly employed by [chavs] or a similar sub-species to describe the hitting or slapping of an individual in the face. ; Due to the nature of chavs worldwide, the grammar of the sentence will be embaressingly incoherent and include a vast combination of other nonsensities. As a cause of the limited intelligence of said scum it is widely believed NOT to be an amalgumation of the two standard english words 'bang' and 'slaps'. ; This word is most usually used by the ringleader of a '[crew]' when threatening an unsuspecting, inoffesive member of the general public.
