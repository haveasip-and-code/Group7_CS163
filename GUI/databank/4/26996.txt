Slobodan Milosevic
You people are pathetic. Stop blaming everything on Slobodan Milosevic. Before you start judging Milosevic you should first take a look at your own history. The worst atrocities known in modern history of Europe were committed by Croat and Muslim Nazis on defenseless Serb population. This, one of the most important parameter of the current Balkan tragedy that is rarely mentioned in the Western press, which is a damn shame because no one will ever know the truth.
