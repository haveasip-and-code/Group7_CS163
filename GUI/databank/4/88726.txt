Carrier Landings
A Navy game involving a long flat table and, generally, a lot of beer. Participants run toward the table and dive onto it face-first. The goal is to arrive safely and not slide off the end. Refinements such as the need to engage 'arresting gear' with one's toes, 'crash and smash' teams using pitchers of beer to extinguish post-crash fires, etc., are common.
