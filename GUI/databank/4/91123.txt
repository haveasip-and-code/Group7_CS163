buck 50
A tear inflicted by a cutting instrument (e.g. a knife or a box cutter) in the skin of the cheek from one corner of the mouth toward the lateral ear. This type of attack is most common in street gang violence and is often used specifically to mark the victim with a lifetime facial scar. Also, the resultant linear scar on the cheek from such a wound.
