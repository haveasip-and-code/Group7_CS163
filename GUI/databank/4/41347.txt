PERSIAN NEW YEAR!!! It shouldbe the official new year date of the entire world because it it the only one that is uninfluenced by religion. It is simply celebrating the NEW YEAR--the first day of spring where the 'dead'/winter is over and the new bud opens, the animals come out and reproduce and everything is happy and new. AKA--NEW YEAR
