Avril Fan
I guess I'm one. Avril isn't exactly liked by everyone, but I don't hate her. Actually, I think she's a good singer. I realize that some people don't recognize her talent because they're too busy being brainwashed by their friends to think she sucks. But she doesn't. There's a song on her CD that describes her dead Grandfather. I can relate to that.
