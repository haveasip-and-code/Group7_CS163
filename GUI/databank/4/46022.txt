real soon now
A vague measurement of time, typically applied to delivery of a software project. It is used sarcastically, to indicate that the product has missed one or several promised delivery dates, and rather than embarrassing themselves by announcing and missing another deadline, the developer is simply saying it will be ready 'real soon now.' When someone says a product is due out 'real soon now' chances are they really don't expect it any time soon. Also abbreviated as [RSN].
