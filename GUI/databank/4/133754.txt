flanger
Flanger- Another common, sick ass effect on amplifers. It is similar to to ' Wah' Effect or Pedal. This effect changes the sounds played ; and shifts it from Treble to Bass to Treble continusly - depending on how much or how long you play-. What the 'Wah' does is that it changes the Bass to Treble -or vice versa, depending where your at- on the press of a pedal, and the flanger takes a little time. ; There is slow and fast Flanger, but the Flanger cannot make the ' Wah' sound. With Tremolo, these two effects combinded will rock. ; Songs that have Flanger: [Blink-182]- Obvious - the verse-, Asthenia -when the guitars some in, verse-, Here's you letter -intro-, Feeling This - intro, even percussion have flanger-. [Simple Plan]- I'd do anything - approx at 2:01, they have both Flanger and Tremolo- ; I won't be there - intro-. [Black Eyed Peas]- Where is the love? ; To listen on the ' Wah' listen to the solo in 'Cold' by [Crossfade] -the electric guitar version-
