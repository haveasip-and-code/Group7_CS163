Marijuana - found in older urban dictionaries of the 1960s. ; From Mezz Mezzrow, the legendary white jazzman and Harlem pot-dealer who turned on Louis Armstrong and other jazz greats during the 1930s. I never heard it actually used on the streets in NY, but someone must have for it to be cited back then. Anyway, old Mezz needs to be remembered for something.
