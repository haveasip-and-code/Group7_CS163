The Epoxies
A synth-punk band started in Portland, Oregon that mixes crazy synth-new wave beats with fast and chaotic guitar riffs comparable to that of The Ramones. The Epoxies have taken everything that is uncool and turned it into a breath of fresh air in the world of new music... FINALLY something new and original to listen to!
