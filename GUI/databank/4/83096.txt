MUSE
Quite simply, this three person band from Great Britain produces the best music im sure I will ever hear. Hearing 'Thoughts of a Dying Athiest' makes me want to touch myself. ; If you like Muse, give yourself a high five! ; If you have never heard Muse, go to www.muse.mu where you can hear their music. ; If you don't like Muse, then you can go fuck off and die, because you are, no doubt, an ignorant bastard with less appreciation for good music than N*sync fans.
