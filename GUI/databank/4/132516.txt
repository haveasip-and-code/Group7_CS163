Hoopz 'n' Handlez
The name started of in Graveney School Tooting, where many great playas noticed that they had some of the most phenomenal shots and handlez, this evolved to hoopz 'n' handelz which was lead by The Bam aka The Young 1 aka Jon Da Don. This team soon developed and more Graveney balas joined the cause, as it climbed the ranks to what it is today... The top London Basketball team out there featuring of course, The Bam, Da Hustla (me), Face, Soulja, Doctor, S.o.S, Masta Blasta, Tonkness 5000, Lurkz and many more...
