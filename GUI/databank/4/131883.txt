marijuana addiction
A make-believe condition invented by the pharmaceutical industry and the right wing politicians that they lobby and make contributions to.This 'condition' was created in an effort to scare people into doing their drugs, which actually are addictive. If the multipurpose cure-all cannibis were decriminalized, the pharmaceutical industry would tank.
