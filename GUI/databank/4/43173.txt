clevedon
not a particularly nice town; typical seaside resort of days-gone-by. immense amounts of old people, a pier which frequently collapses and a beach on which if you steal pebbles you get taken to court are just some of it's attractions! ; on the other hand, it's nicer than nailsea, and the houses on top of the hill over looking the severn are beautiful.
