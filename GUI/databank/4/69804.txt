Ill dickin'
noun: A virtuoso, power drill-esque male sexual performance defined as a constant, consistent, and prolongued hellacious pounding of the inner depths of the female vagina with the penis; often results in extreme painful ecstasy and intense post-coital soreness for the female and messianic self-satisfaction for the male.
