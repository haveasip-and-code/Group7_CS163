shav
The 'shav' is to the upper middle classes what 'chav' is to the working classes. Here the said individual is able to support their consumer lifestyle through legitimate means but does so in such an appaulingly vulgar and obvious manner that it renders their efforts laughable. ; These sort can most commonly be found in Cheshire, Adley Edge and Surrey. Their favourite means of transport are horses when on illegal hunts, or SUV's (or any other vehicle over 2litres which takes up both sides of the road)when picking the kids up from school.
