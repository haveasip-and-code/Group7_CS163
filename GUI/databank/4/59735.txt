olan
The origins of this word can be found in ancient Aradhippou, known now as ' Kingdom of Aradhippou' in Cyprus. It is essential to use it as many times as possible within sentences, mainly at the end. This way it is easy to recognise if the person is from the Kingdom, although Barbarians are also using it widely now to sound cool.
