lexington  va
A small town of about 7,800 people in western Virginia with two universities a river and a few cops to patrol it all. This city boasts the second to highest property value in all of Virginia. A normal 2 bedroom, half bathroom house would cost you 450,000$(no joke). The reason for this is that it is a hisotrical place where Confederate General Robert E Lee founded Washington and Lee University and General Stonewall Jackson went to VMI, and other stupid historical crap as well as a pretty 'view'. Anyway, the cops are extremely loose and you can get away with most anything. Everyone in this town is either a liberal, a redneck, white trash, a gangsta(there are gangsters, too), or a college student.
