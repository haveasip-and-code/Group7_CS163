B Unit
Blood Unit. ; Bloods formed from the Piru gang on 1972 at Centennial High School, taking the Piru Bloods name from 'Piru' street in Compton, California. The group formed to protect members from the Crips. Other gangs with the same motive started using the Pirus' and Bloods' names to signify alignment with the main gang. Although the Bloods' membership is smaller than the Crips, they are potentially more dangerous, particularly when present in numbers. ; They most often identify with the color red. West coast gang members often use a red bandana and while on the East Coast they use red colored beads. They will also use various graphic styles and terms emphasizing a disrespect for Crips.
