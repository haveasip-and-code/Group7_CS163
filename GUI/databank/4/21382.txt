Claudio: ; The one I know who used to be my friend is a total ass who thinks he is better than you. I basically consider him and his newly found online 'girlfriend' Wapanese. He sells his friends out to game tournaments and looses thusly only to meet his 'girlfriend' for the first time. To impress her, he bought a skateboard, and he doesn't even use it outside, he 'practices' inside. Soon he'll get a snowboard and 'practice' Snowboarding inside as well. ; To describe him, let's just say he has played the Sonic games a bit too much, and dyes his hair blue and wears only red shoes. He also tries to act like Sonic and try to race you, yet he was the one who sat on his fat ass and played only video games while you were taking Track and whoop his ass at every challenge. Long Story Short, a wannabe who thinks he is better than you, when even a 3 year old is better than him. The person above me is also right I seriously hope he becomes 'homosexually inclined'.
