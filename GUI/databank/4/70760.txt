Butterfly knife
A common misconception is that the Balisong is actually a Butterfly knife, this misconception came from stupid white people going to asia, and coming back with the things..... ; A Butterfly Knife is a large, flat shortsword, with a D-Shaped handguard, the Balisong, which is commonly called a butterfly knife, has nothing to do with it.....
