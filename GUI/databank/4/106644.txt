Public Forum
Public Forum is a type of [high school debate] usually reserved for those who aren't necesarily the brightest kids. Set up by [Ted Turner], Public Forum was used as a means to have high school debate become a 'spectator event', which was nearly impossible under the other forms. Because of this, PF is extremely simple and is about a topic, or 'resolution', that changes every month. Arguements are very back-and-forth, however they may have no substance to them at all.
