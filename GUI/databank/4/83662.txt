AZN
The true definition of 'AZN': a short way of saying asian. Nothing else. Doesnt nessesarily mean an asian that thinks he's gangster, has asian pride, high school asian drop out, or anything else. The origin came from the internet when other people shortened the way of saying asian to AZN(just like LoL=laugh out loud,KiT=keep in touch,WtF=what the fu**, etc.) This is true because I study urban slang and the origin didnt even come from asians. In fact, its really just a way some people type asian in the internet(white people even type AZN instead of asian 'cause it's faster to type). So people who claims that azn is just a retarded way asians say asian are wrong because asians were not the first one to say 'AZN'
