jopke
(noun) Hellmuthspeak, in poker language, for 'Joke', misspelled because of the relative geographic similarity of the 'o' key and 'p' key on a QWERTY keyboard. Jopke is what happens when a good poker player loses a hand to a bad poker player because the bad poker player played better in that instance.
