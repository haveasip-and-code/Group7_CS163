Let's be friends
When a guy & a girl are usually in the [talking] or [dating] stage of a relationship and the guy tries to kiss her, but it sucks. She doesn't want to be mean because she didn't like the kiss, so she tells him that they should just be friends. ; OR: The guy or girl really likes the other, but they know that the other is a [freak] with lots of people. ; Syn: [sluts], [man slut]
