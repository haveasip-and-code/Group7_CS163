Reality Check
A New York State-based youth anti-smoking organization that uses the same manipulative tactics to attract teens that they denigrate Big Tobacco for. They have a branch in every county in New York State. The organization and its representatives tend to be hypocritical, self-righteous, and defensive when contradicted. Currently involved in a censorship campaign to ban instances of smoking from movies, without any regard for the sanctity of the art.
