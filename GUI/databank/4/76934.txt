Monroe
A town in upper fairfield county, that is becoming a more upscale place to live. Nick named, 'Funroe,' and 'the R O E.' There is never anything to do, and if its past 12:00 in the morning and you dont want to sit in your car calling people on your cell phone all night, you go to 'the diner' there is only one. There are only about 13 traffic lights in the town, and there are too many banks, and not enough shops. Almost everyone smokes and drinks. The fashion is made up of mostly polos and khakis for guys, and jeans and button ups, polos, and tanks from Abercrombie&Polo. There are all types of cliques, the preps, jocks, stoners, goths, punks, nerds, etc. The richer kids drive new jettas, civics, or jeeps. They dominate the social scene.
