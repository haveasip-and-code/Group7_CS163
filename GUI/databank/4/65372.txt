Wrought from a moment where you feel under pressure, one has been constricted in an environment of alienation and feels lonely. Every day is terrible,and moments thereafter are dull, irritating, and lack quality interaction with others. You cant be a [super pimp], Counter Strike begins to mean nothing, and finally you realize everything is useless unless you can be home...where the heart is. <3
