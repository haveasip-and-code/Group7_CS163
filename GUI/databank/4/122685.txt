crypt orchid
the scientific terms used to describe the physical condition of a male born without having had his testicles descend into the scrotum and therefore his scrotum is empty and his testicles are in the trunk of the body. This male may get prosthetic testicles for his sac or be doomed to a life of flapping scrotum skin in the wind.
