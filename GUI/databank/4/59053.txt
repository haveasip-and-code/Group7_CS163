breakfast club
also [the breakfast club] ; the best movie i have ever seen in my life. its about a brain, a jock, a basketcase, a princess, and a criminal who get a saturday detention for 9 hours and they get to know each other for who they really are, and not just what they look like. ; i personally like the criminal. he can light a match on his teeth, and so can i.
