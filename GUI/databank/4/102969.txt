as
as is another [cs] prefix for maps, i.e., as_oilrig ; It comprises of the [ct]s having a VIP to help escape from a complex to another place, i.e. a chopper ; The VIP is a random member of the CT team, and cannot buy weapons. This is really annoying for one team member who is excluded each round (almost). Meaning is the CTs are noobs, the VIP is pretty much dead.
