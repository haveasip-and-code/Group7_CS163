Emery
Screamo band that is the epitome of awesome. Mixing lyrics that are both self-exploring as well as faintly spiritual, Emery blasts listeners with an unusually fresh sound. Their songs have a tendency to be intentionally profound, using rhythm breaks and escalating volumes to shout out a certain word or phrase. The main singer's (Toby's) voice is deeper and much more mellow than you'd expect, but he can stretch it to pleasing heights. There's also a screaming element that is basically background to the music and lyrics as a whole, but also captures this element of extremity that they obviously desire to show. ; So far, they have two albums: The Weak's End and The Question. Both have their share of intense songs as well as quiet, escalating songs that seem to have a little more meaning to them. ; Emery also throws a sweet concert, where the intensity of their music is greatly emphasized. Moshers will love them. ; Best songs: ; Walls, Ponytale Parades, Fractions, Under Serious Attack, So Cold I Can See My Breath, Studying Politics
