blog-hopping
An often used phrase when on the 'MSN Spaces'. ; When you look at someone else's space, if they have choosen to add an updated space list you can 'hop' from one blog to another reading through peoples comments - most of which are not even worthy of being on the internet. ; Some people like to make a game of it -seeing how many Spaces you can get too until there are no other links to another spaces. I have no idea why this is a form of entertainment, but meh, it keeps the plebs off the streets.
