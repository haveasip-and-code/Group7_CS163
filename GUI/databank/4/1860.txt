adgrunt
word coined at ad-rag.com 1999 to describe the people who visit in one word rather than saying 'you know, the art directors, planners, copywriters, art buyers, media people, designers...etc'. ; Instead of a disgruntled worker it's an adgrunt, ie ad worker, who may or may not be in a perpetual state of disgruntled. Like the footsoldiers of advertising out on the front line of the advertising brand wars. And no, it is not a coincidence that part of the word is that deep guttural sound most of us adgrunts mutter when the client asks for ; something stupid, impossible, or the logo bigger.
