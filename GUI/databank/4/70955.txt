FEMUS
An annoying coworker who thinks that he is an authority on every subject ever conceived. Behavior includes (but is not limited to) butting in to every conversation within ear-shot, complains incessantly, taking over and fucking up other people's projects, picking fights for the sake of fighting, fucking up because he thinks that he knows everything and doesn't need to [RTFM] or ask questions to more knowledgeable staff members, invites himself along to lunches and happy hours, brags incessantly, physically stinks of rotten cabbage, and crying whenever something doesn't go his way. ; Originally conceived as an acronym for our coworker Sam's [bizarro] twin - 'Fat, Evil, Melting, and Ugly Sammy.'
