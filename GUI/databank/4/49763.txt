conformist
Despite [popular] belief, we are -not- all [conformists]. We are however, all [influenced] by sources other than ourselves. An '[individual]' would be a person whom does what he/she wishes to, for reasons that he/she has justified themselves, rather than doing something because someone else deems it as correct, or 'cool', a [conformist] does the opposite. In short, a [conformist] gives way too much of a shit about what others think. ; Sadly, the polulation has decided to [categorise] themselves as one thing or another, leading to so many labels, that we just assume that everyone is being a [conformist slut], the vast majority of the time. ; The whole 'Emo' thing is the current conformist favourite, even though the concept is that 'Nobody understands me.' and 'I'm so different.', when everyone undergoes this transformation, being a basketcase is now 'cool'. ; I say we don't give them psychological help, and instead leave them to bleed from the wrists, crying, until they die.
