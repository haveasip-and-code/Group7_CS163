Patrick Star
The cornucopia of awesome, Patrick is a dumb, pink starfish that often hangs out with his best pal Spongebob, as they wander around their hometown, Bikini Bottom, blessing the ocean with their stupidity. He is the dumber of the two (and that's saying something), but often has sudden bursts of genius, which disappear faster than they came. He is also the funnier of the two because he has the most badass voice and also because he had reached the absolute zenith of stupidity. That's right, Patrick Star had mastered the art of dumbassness (in a good way). ; He rocks and you know it.
