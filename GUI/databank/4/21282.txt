ODU
Actually stands for Old Dominion University, the nickname of the crappy state that it is located in, Virginia, for those who don't know. Is actually a university with six crappy colleges in it, such as College of Ass and Lips. The only thing that makes it great is the fact that it's a commuter college, but no one can ever get to class because of the crappy traffic. BAL is 9 stories of crap, as are all the buildings, and someone needs to run into the glass wall of the Ted, so named for an old fart who donated money. Also known as the school with the unusable monorail down the center of campus.
