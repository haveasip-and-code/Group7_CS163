lebanese
People who sit on a milk crate outside Oportos at Brighton screaming derogatory comments at woman who 'want them' and stare at males from other ethnicities and say 'what????' several times if they have eye contact. ; Also people who congregate in their cars(WRX,Corolla,anything but a muscle car) to Stanmore Mc'Donalds but don't go inside because the food is too expensive.
