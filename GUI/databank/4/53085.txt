ciao
you fuckers don't know shit so shut the hell up and listen: ciao comes from and ancient word in the medieval venice dialect originally meaning 'slave of'. So it was used for a long time to geeetings salves when they were walking around the city freely, after being released from their owner. the word lost its original meaning and now is used everywhere to say BOTH hello and GOODBYE. is not only hi, and is not only goodbye. Is not really fancy, since it the most popular word in italy and its really informal: you can't say ciao to your professor or your boss, but you can say 'ciao 'pa' to your dad or you can say 'ciao vez' to your good ol buddy. Ciao also means ' whaterver'. If you are talkin with a guy and is not getting the point you can end the conversation sayin: ' vabbeh, ciao allora' and that's kinda retarded.
