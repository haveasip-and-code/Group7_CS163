the screen savers
The Screen Savers was an hour-and-30-minute long program on TechTV. ; The hosts were Patrick Norton and Leo Laporte. They were joined by Martin Sargent, who did Site of the Night, Morgan Webb,and who did the Mac and Windows tips. Megan Morrone, Kevin Rose, Dan Huard handled calls and the website and stuff. Yoshi(real name Josh), modded everything he could get his hands on. There was also some red-headded chick but I can't remember her name. ; The show's last 30 minutes were chopped away. The set was changed 3 times, and relocated to Los Angeles, then changed two more times. Morgan went on to co-host X-Play(formerly Extended Play), Megan had a child, Martin went off to host his own show, and Leo took over as host Call for Help. ; This left Patrick and Kevin as hosts. When TechTV was bought, everything was moved to Los Angeles. Patrick and Yoshi decided to stay back in San Diego. Segment Producer Sarah Lane joined Kevin as host. After the set change, Alex Albrecht and Kevin Rose hosted and Sarah just did stuff off to the side. Alex leaves to do other entertainment stuff and is replaced with Kevin Pereira. ; The show is renamed to Attack of the Show and the set is changed again. Kevin Rose leaves to host a download-only show. The only original Screen Saver left on G4TechTV is Morgan Webb. ; At the time this was typed. Attack of the Show has had two guests co-hosts. There will be five more co-hosts until one is finally chosen.
