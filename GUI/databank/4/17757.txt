scaliwag
the definition of scaliwag, according to the inventor of the word, is whores that got picked up by pirates and other sailors in port. Then got fu*ked in every oriface imaginable, using any and every available blunt object (specifically including the pepper shaker). When the whore was so utterly abused and disgusting that nobody wanted to touch her, the sailors would just throw her overboard.
