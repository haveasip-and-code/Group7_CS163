Beverage
Derived from the sexual position 'The Beverly Hills' where a man finds the girl at the bar that has the biggest ego and thinks that her 'shit don't stink'. Said man takes this girl home and while ploughing her doggie style, he sticks two fingers in her buttocks and shoves both fingers in her nose, then says: 'Shit don't stink now, does it?'. These girls are usually found in Beverly Hills.
