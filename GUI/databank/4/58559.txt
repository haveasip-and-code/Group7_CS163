surfer
There are 3 types of surfers: ; 1. 70's and 80's Surfers - mostly from the 70's and 80's, the stereotype for these guys have long bleached hair, a tan, say things like 'Gnarly' and 'Totaly', listen to rock music and smoke alot of weed. ; i.e. [Jeff Spicoli] from the movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' ; 2. Preppy Surfers - Annoying guys with curly hair, listens to emo and pop punk and wear brands like Hollister, Billabong, and Abercrombie and wear their clothes tight as shit. Most of them don't even surf, they just try to fit in with all the other fools. ; 3. Surfer - Someone who just likes surfing.
