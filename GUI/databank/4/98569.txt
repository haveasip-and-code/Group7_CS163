Pup'N'Taco
Small drive through Hot-dog and Taco stand chain in and around Los Angeles and Orange County, CA. Locations sold to Wienershcnitzel and Tommy Burger in the mid-1980's. Pup'N'Taco was dirt cheap, and a great place for zitty faced punk rockers to have thier first job. Served the infamous Taco Dog, which was a hot dog bun filled with taco meat and topped with cheese. Ref. see also 'Naugles'. Only people of a certain age remember the Pup'N'Taco. If YOU remember the PNT - you are way more OC than Mischa Barton could ever hope to be.
