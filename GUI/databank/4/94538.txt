port washington
Port Washington is a town in northern Long Island. The middle school pretty much sucks, and most of the staff voted to kick out the Principal.. but no luck yet. We have kool yaht clubs, and we all know Main St. rocks. It takes us about 45 minutes to get to a decent mall.. and we wish they would just build one here! The rich kids live in Sands Point, and everyone else lives elsewhere. ; Thats pretty much it. COME TO PORT WASHINGTON!
