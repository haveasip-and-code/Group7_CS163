Authority Zero
Best fucking punk band out there. They're mostly punk but combine some reggae and ska. They're basically one part Sublime and one part Pennywise. They have a lot of Spanish and Portuguese influences in their music too and they have lyrics in both of these languages. ; It pisses me off that so few people actually know who they are, even though they released two CDs with a major label (Lava). Buy/download their shit ASAP. I can't really pick a favorite song since they're all good, but try downloading 'Lying Awake.' When the lead singer was asked about mp3's, he said 'i think it's rad' so don't feel guilty about it.
