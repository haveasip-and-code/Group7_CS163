stud roulette
A fun/weird version of roulette mainly played while heavily intoxicated. It is played indoors. Participants stand about 20 feet away from a wall built with dry wall, put their heads down in a charging manner(bending 90 degrees at the waist) and running at the wall as fast as they possibly can. The objective is to survive by missing the wooden 2x4 studs in the wall. You lose when you head explodes on impact.
