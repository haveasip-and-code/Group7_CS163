grammar nazi
A Grammar Nazi is often either ; 1. A teacher, most commonly an English teacher, who will give a student an F on his/her paper because they used 'they're' instead of 'their' or 'to' instead of 'too'. ; 2. A [blog]ger who feels the need to go to as many sites as possible to correct their grammar or spelling. ; Despite popular belief, the world does need a few grammar nazis, if you would beleive that.
