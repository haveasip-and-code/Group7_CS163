Top tier
In a fighting game, reprensents the strongest characters in the game. Top tiers are usually marked by higher priority moves, hard hitting attacks, strategy variety, speed, and (sometimes) ease. When a game first comes out, the top tiers are usually the easy-to-use cheap characters, and players tend to rely on cheap tactics such as 'spamming' a high priority move. After some time, the game tactics begin to develop as people learn new strategies with other characters. Eventually the 'cheap' top tiers are replaced, knocked down a level, or accompanied, by new characters. A good fighting game should be as tierless as possible, although this is hard to achieve.
