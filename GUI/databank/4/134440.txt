Sunnyside
An area in Queens, New York, located near Astoria and Jckson Heights. Urban but friendly, Population is a huge mix made up of a lot of Hispanics, Chinese, White, and Blacks. A few indian deli's too, an overground subway, with bootlegers under it. A great place to live.. not suburban but not a full out ghetto.
