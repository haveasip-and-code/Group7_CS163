del's
Would be Rhode Island's state drink if it wasn't for the coffee milk. Both of which can call Rhode Island it's home. Del's is a Lemonade that comes in a variety of flavors and can be bought at stands and shops throughout the state, especially in the summer. Del's and vodka are said to be a great mix.
