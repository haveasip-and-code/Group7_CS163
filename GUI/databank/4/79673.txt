osiecki
Osiecki is a proud member of the chess association. He enjoys a nice pair of slacks and button up plaid shirts. His dislikes include the lack of grammar that the youth of today has become accutomed to. He is never seen without his pocket protector and his calculator. He is an admirer of sunsets and adores walks on the beach. Though he seems like a hard core rocker, he really justs wants to live life to the fullest. In order to get over his fear of public speaking, He is curently taking up a public speaking course...by mail. This rock and roller is the ideal person to have some fun with.
