heeaah
Deriving from a favorite saying of the character Timmy (or 'Timmah') from South Park. Often times, Timmy responds to many questions and statements with 'Heeahh.' Likewise, anyone can use this utterance to mean many things such as 'I don't know', 'I don't care', or 'I'm not listening'. It mostly comes in handy when one just doesn't feel like giving a competent response to something. It can commonly be spelled with more e's or a's, or with more h's on the end.
