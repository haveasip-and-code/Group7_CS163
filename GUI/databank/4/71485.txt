Chinese MBA Students
A category of students from mainland China that undertakes a MBA course in Europe, United States or Canada. This people usually do not integrate with other fellow students, don't share their knowledge and don't participate. They are specialists in copying the work and organizing parallel activities, where the non-chinese are never invited. They have excellent marks, but don't expect any help or possibility for good professional networking. Chinese MBA students are fantastic in the West to re-define our assumptions and all positive prejudice we had from such a prosperous society. There are no doubts that China would be in a even better shape if their future, high-potential international managers were not so egoists.
