Tree Hugger
An environmentalist who attempts to save a tree by wrapping their body around it. Most are completely idiotic or completely brain washed. Also, they don't think of all the meat, plants, trees, water, etc. that has been killed or polluted by their mere existence. They should do the world a favor and create a human mulch pile out of themself.
