on the nickle
5th Street in downtown Los Angeles - a place where many homeless hang out. The song 'On The Nickel' was written for the made-for-TV movie 'On The Nickel' by Ralph Waite. 'The Nickel' is a mission located on 5th street. It seems that anyone 'on the nickel' would be someone down and out with no place to go.
