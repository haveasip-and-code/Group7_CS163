boo pipes
I was playing 'Mario Kart Double Dash' on the GameCube and I unlocked a car called the 'boo pipes' and that day I had a serious case of ass gurgling,soooooooo put name and action together and got 'the boo pipes' - Internal farting/gurgling. When you have it you must exclaim 'I have a serious case of the boo pipes!'
