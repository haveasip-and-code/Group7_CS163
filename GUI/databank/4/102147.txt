punto rojo
punto rojo is a spanish/mexican/latino/mexican-american/cholo phrase for a marijuana cigarette (which our squad would not condone the possession of). it means 'red point' and describes the tip of the [spliff] or [bone] having the glowing red cherry (which our five members retain full and intact possession of). ; this is a relatively obscure term, but will win you favor from the hippest mexican people when used over the more 'streety' [lenyo].
