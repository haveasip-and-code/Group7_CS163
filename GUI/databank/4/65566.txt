shot checkers
1. (n.) A particularly exhilirating drinking game involving checkers. Players substitute shot glasses filled with liquor for the red and black plastic checkers pieces. Standard rules of checkers apply. Once a player's shot glass is jumped by the opponent, he must drink the contents of the glass right away. Double jumps in this version of checkers are especially devastating. If player's head collapes on the board, it is an automatic forfeit.
