gauntlet
Gauntlet was originally an arcade game made in the early 80's. It was one of the first 'top-down' view role playing games, in which you could control one of four types of player classes. The objective of the game was to find keys and kill enemies and proceed to new rooms. Has seen many incarnations on various systems over time.
