Australia
Happy, down to earth people, very laid back (Perth especially, Sydney not so much, but still laid back compared to the rest of the world), great health care system, gorgeous beaches, nice cities, cute towns. Though those accents you hear in movies are totally over-the-top (e.g. Crocodile Dundee style accents). The accent varies from the East Coast to the West Coast (East Coast accent is stronger). Has the best junk food (i always thought America did til I actually went their), we have WAY more many flavours of potato chips and chocolate is nicer and more flavours. We love our sports, not all of us, but most for sure. ; Ok now for the down-side of Australia....it gets hot in summer! 40C (104F) is not uncommon (even higher sometimes, but most Aussies enjoy summer and go to the beach a lot. Most places don't get snow and the places that do the snow isn't as good as overseas snow, the people that live there will probably disagree. We don't have [heaps] of international movies and entertainment been made here except for Australian productions and tv. We don't have as many free-to-air TV channels, but we have enough so we're not couch potatoes. We get made out to other countries like we're bush weirdos with bad accents, which annoys just about every Aussie I know. No other country can do our accent right, do you how many times me and my family & friends crack up laughing in 'Lost' when people do fake accents (they sound awful!!!), Emily (because she is an Aussie) is the only one who really sounds like us. People also think we're just beach and bush....so not true...we do have big cities with good shopping. ; Overall though the upside definetely outweighs the lows. I love it here and would never live anywhere else, though I do love other countries, but Australia is definetely my fave and my home.
