=tổ chức múa lân cho trẻ em xem+to stage a unicorn dance for an audience of children Today, the dragon dance is no longer considered an entertainment reserved for children. Originating from China, it has become part of Vietnamese culture. It is performed not only during Tết or the Mid-Autumn Festival, but also on special occasions such as ground-breaking or inauguration ceremonies. It can be performed on the day when recruits leave their native towns for military units, or on other occasions. If you think that anyone can perform a Dragon Dance, you are mistaken. As an art, Dragon Dance has its principles and rules. A dragon dance usually lasts from 20 to 25 minutes. It consists of five episodes: In the first episode, the dragon appears on the stage; in the second, it exits; in the third, it enters again and rolls over the ground, then it kneels before the audience, and finally bows to the donors. For each episode, there is a different way of beating the drum. Accompanied by the cymbals, the drum sounds like that of a military march. And an expert can distinguish all the five basic feelings of humans (joy, anger, love, hatred and fear) depicted by the beatings of the drum. The drummer not only must be versed in his art, but also knows how to assess the situation. For example, when he sees that the owner of the building hangs the prize on the balcony of his house, the drummer must use the one-three rhythm (cac, bum, bum bum) As the dragon hears the drum change its rhythm, it grows more excited. But when the drum beating is slow, the dragon knows that it is time to wait and relax.A team of dragon dancers consists of thirty persons, as they have to take turns to play the main part. They have different occupations, but when the need arises, they gather at once at the rallying place. In the past, this was an occasion for amusement, not for money.+The part of the dragon is performed by three to five persons, but the most important part is that of the head of the dragon.. Usually the performer must be versed in wushu. Another part requires some skills: Hồng Hài Nhi (a character in the Chinese novel entitled "Pilgrimage to the West") juggling with two balls of imitation jade he challenges the dragon to try to catch them and thus perform an amusing dance. A part of much more importance is that of the Monkey (one of the main characters of the aforesaid novel). The Monkey also leads the dragon to enter a house, and leave it. And, more important, he manages to stop the dragon when the latter is too excited and loses self-control in its "pursuit of prey".However, to most accounts, the most important role is that of Ông Địa (the genie of the earth). He is like a clown in the Western theatre or in Vietnam's classical opera, but unlike the clown, he does not utter any words. He makes people laugh with his gestures. Therefore, Ông Địa will be immediately replaced if he fails to play his rolẹIt takes a person four years to be able to perform a part in a dragon dance which usually lasts 20-25 minutes. On Tết Festival, he has to work for four days running, especially on the first, second and third days of the Lunar New Year. Nowadays, a team of dragon dancers can earn a lot of money - at times, nearly ten million VND. Seventy percent of the earnings is divided among members, 10 percent will go to the bonus fund, 10 percent is reserved for re-investment (a dragon costs up to three million VND). The rest is used as "working capital".Dragon dance services are no longer available for free. Those who are interested should order in advance Foreign companies often rent dragon dance teams. In late 1995, San Miguel Beer, for example, offered bonuses worth several million VND. In recent years, the dragon dance has gone through many refinements with a view to catching up with modern times while preserving the best of Vietnam's cultural traditions
