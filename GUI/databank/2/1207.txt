truyền thống
- Tradition
-The life style of Vietnamese people is closely attached to their villages and native land. LANG (village in Vietnamese language) is CHIENG (in Tay-Thai language), BAN (in Muong language) and BUON (in languages of several minority groups inhabiting Central Highlands). LANG is not only an administrative organization but also an economic unit based on sections of land on which farming products are made. Typical village features may be a banyan tree standing at the village front gate (or bamboo groves surrounding the village), deep water wells, the roof of the village temple, a far mountain peak, a river running nearby or may be the paddy fields and joyous bustling village festivals
