-Classical drama
- Tuồng (Classical drama) was formed in the 12th century, and in the 17th century it was very much in vogue. Since 1950, Tuồng has referred to Nghệ Thuật Hát Bội (Classical drama art). The Tuong play consists of dances, songs and music which are highly stylised, conventional and imbued with symbolism. Thanks to the stylised, symbolic gestures used by the actors, and a good deal of imagination on behalf of the spectators, the scenery is very simple. Mountains, hills, rivers, dawn, twilight, horse riding and battlefields, are all presented on stage by using a minimum of accessories and technical equipments. Tuồng includes many strict norms on styles of speaking, singing and dancing. In chronological order and by their contents, the Tuồng plays are divided into traditional plays, royal plays, social plays and modern plays. The most popular ones include Son Hau, Dao Phi Phung, Tam Nu Do Vuong, Trung Nu Vuong and Ngheu So Oc Hen
