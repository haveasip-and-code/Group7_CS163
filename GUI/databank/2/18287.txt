-Vai Thieu (Thieu litchi) is a bit bigger than a longan. Unlike the skin of Longan which is rather smooth, the skin of litchi is rough with some ripples. The skin is dark red. The pulp of a litchi is transparently white, but is thicker than a longan. Therefore, litchi pulp is juicier than a longan. Litchi seed is also smaller than Longan seed. Thieu litchis are grown in many big orchards in Hung Yen province
