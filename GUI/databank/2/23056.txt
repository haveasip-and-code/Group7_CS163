- Different from China in the north, Vietnam referred to the Việt community in the south. Through its 4,000-year history, Việt Nam was named Văn Lang, Âu Lạc, Vạn Xuân, Đại Cồ Việt, Đại Việt, Đại Ngu, Đại Việt. Under Thời Bắc Thuộc (Chinese domination), Vietnam was called Giao Châu, An Nam Đô Hộ Phủ (Dominated An Nam). Since 1804, Nhà Nguyễn renamed this country Việt Nam. However, King Minh Mạng (Nhà Nguyễn - Nguyễn Dynasty) himself admitted that the name Việt Nam had existed long before. Nguyễn Trãi, Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm and Lê Quý Đôn had also used the name Việt Nam. In 1991, in Đồng Đăng (Lạng Sơn), the archaeologists discovered the Thủy Môn Đình stela with the words Việt Nam on it. Under the French domination, Vietnam was named An Nam, and An Nam also referred to Central Vietnam itself. The name Việt Nam has been officially and popularly used from 1945 till our days.
