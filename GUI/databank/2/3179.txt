- Pomelo, shaddock
-There are several kinds of Buoi (pomelo) regionally famous for their taste, and each of them is named after the locality where it is grown (Buoi Bien Hoa, Buoi Phuc Trach, Buoi Thuan Hai, for example). Buoi duong Phuc Trach (Phuc Trach sweet pomelo) has been famous widely in the country after it was awarded a medal at a national fruit fair organised in 1938. The Far East Economic Review remarked: "In Vietnam's central coast, there is a particularly delicious pomelo. Kept after a while, the juice in the pomelo segments becomes muddy as if it is some sort of sugar itself. You can try the fruit as much as you can"
