-Cha ca (grilled chopped fish) is a kind of time-consuming and meticulously prepared food. To enjoy it, you will have on the table various auxiliary dishes: A small bowl of tasty Mam Tom (shrimp paste) mixed with a few drops of rice liquor and lemon juice, then carefully stirred with some added slices of hot chilly. A plate of roasted groundnuts, which are a rich brown colour following the removal of their flimsy covers
-Accompanying the two dishes will be a plate of pure white rice vermicelli and a plate of spicy vegetables. Finally, a stove with a pan of boiling oil on its top will be placed on the table. You will open the grilles to allow pieces of grilled fish to drop into the oil. Things are done in this way to ensure that connoisseurs receive piping hot food
