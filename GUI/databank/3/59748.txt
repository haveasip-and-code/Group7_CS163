purism
Rigid purity; the quality of being affectedly pure or nice, especially in the choice of language; over-solicitude as to purity. \"His political purism.\" De Quincey. The English language, however, . . . had even already become too thoroughly and essentially a mixed tongue for his doctrine of purism to be admitted to the letter. Craik.
