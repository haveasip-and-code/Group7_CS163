G. jü, interj., used in calling to a horse, It. giò, F. dia, used to turn a horse to the left.]  To turn to the off side, or from the driver (i.e., in the United States, to the right side); -- said of cattle, or a team; used most frequently in the imperative, often with off, by drivers of oxen, in directing their teams, and opposed to haw, or hoi.
