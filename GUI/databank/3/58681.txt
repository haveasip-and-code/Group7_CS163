emulation
1. The endeavor to equal or to excel another in qualities or actions; an assiduous striving to equal or excel another; rivalry. A noble emulation heats your breast. Dryden. 2. Jea Such factious emulations shall arise. Shak. Syn. -- Competition; rivalry; contest; contention; strife. -- Emulation, Competition, Rivalry. Competition is the struggle of two or more persons for the same object. Emulation is an ardent desire for superiority, arising from competition, but now implying, of necessity, any improper feeling. Rivalry is a personal contest, and, almost of course, has a selfish object and gives rise to envy. \"Competition and emulation have honor for their basis; rivalry is but a desire for selfish gratification. Competition and emulation animate to effort; rivalry usually produces hatred. Competition and emulation seek to merit success; rivalry is contented with obtaining it.\" Crabb.
