enjoin
1. To lay upon, as an order or command; to give an injunction to; to direct with authority; to order; to charge. High matter thou enjoin'st me. Milton. I am enjoined by oath to observe three things. Shak. 2. (Law)  To prohibit or restrain by a judicial order or decree; to put an injunction on. This is a suit to enjoin the defendants from disturbing the plaintiffs. Kent. Note: Enjoin has the force of pressing admonition with authority; as, a parent enjoins on his children the duty of obedience. But it has also the sense of command; as, the duties enjoined by God in the moral law. \"This word is more authoritative than direct, and less imperious than command.\" Johnson.\n\nTo join or unite. [Obs.] Hooker.
