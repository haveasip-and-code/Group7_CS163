turtledove
1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of pigeons belonging to Turtur and allied genera, native of various parts of the Old World; especially, the common European species (Turtur vulgaris), which is noted for its plaintive note, affectionate disposition, and devotion to its mate. Note: The South African turtledove (T. albiventris), and the ashy turtledove of India (T. rubicolus), are similar to the European species in their habits. 2. (Zoöl.)  Any one of several species of pigeons more or less resembling the true turtledoves, as the American mourning dove (see under Dove), and the Australian turtledove (Stictopelia cuneata). Note: The turtledove of the Scriptures is probably Turtur risorius, a species which is still plentiful in Egypt and other Eastern countries. It is closely allied to the European turtledove.
