apsis

One of the two points of an orbit, as of a planet or satellite, which are at the greatest and least distance from the central body, corresponding to the aphelion and perihelion of a planet, or to the apogee and perigee of the moon. The more distant is called the higher apsis; the other, the lower apsis; and the line joining them, the line of apsides. 2. (Math.)  In a curve referred to polar co√∂rdinates, any point for which the radius vector is a maximum or minimum. 3. (Arch.)  Same as Apse.
