sibyl
1. (Class. Antiq.)  A woman supposed to be endowed with a spirit of prophecy. Note: The number of the sibyls is variously stated by different authors; but the opinion of Varro, that there were ten, is generally adopted. They dwelt in various parts of Persia, Greece, and Italy. 2. A female fortune teller; a pythoness; a prophetess. \"An old highland sibyl.\" Sir W. Scott.
