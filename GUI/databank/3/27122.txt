hemiptera
An order of hexapod insects having a jointed proboscis, including four sharp stylets (mandibles and maxill√¶), for piercing. In many of the species (Heteroptera) the front wings are partially coriaceous, and different from the others. Note: They are divided into the Heteroptera, including the squash bug, soldier bug, bedbug, etc.; the Homoptera, including the cicadas, cuckoo spits, plant lice, scale insects, etc.; the Thysanoptera, including the thrips, and, according to most recent writers, the Pediculina or true lice.
