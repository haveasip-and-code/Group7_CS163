unlucky
1. Not lucky; not successful; unfortunate; ill-fated; unhappy; as, an unlucky man; an unlucky adventure; an unlucky throw of dice; an unlucky game. Note: This word is properly applied to incidents in which failure results from chance or fortuity, as in games of hazard, rather than from lack or feebleness of effort. 2. Bringing bad luck; ill-omened; inauspicious. Haunt me not with that unlucky face. Dryden. 3. Mischievous; as, an unlucky wag. [Colloq.]
