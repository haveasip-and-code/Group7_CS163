sunshine
1. The light of the sun, or the place where it shines; the direct rays of the sun, the place where they fall, or the warmth and light which they give. But all sunshine, as when his beams at noon Culminate from the equator. Milton. 2. Anything which has a warming and cheering influence like that of the rays of the sun; warmth; illumination; brightness. That man that sits within a monarch's heart, And ripens in the sunshine of his favor. Shak.\n\nSunshiny; bright. Shak. \"Sunshine hours.\" Keble.
