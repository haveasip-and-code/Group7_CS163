maker
1. One who makes, forms, or molds; a manufacturer; specifically, the Creator. The universal Maker we may praise. Milton. 2. (Law)  The person who makes a promissory note. 3. One who writes verses; a poet. [Obs.] Note: \"The Greeks named the poet poihth`s, which name, as the most excellent, hath gone through other languages. It cometh of this word poiei^n, make; wherein, I know not whether by luck or wisdom, we Englishmen have met well the Greeks in calling him a maker.\" Sir P. Sidney.
