lory
Any one of many species of small parrots of the family Trichoglossid√¶, generally having the tongue papillose at the tip, and the mandibles straighter and less toothed than in common parrots. They are found in the East Indies, Australia, New Guinea, and the adjacent islands. They feed mostly on soft fruits and on the honey of flowers. Note: The lory, or louri, of South Africa is the white-crested plantain eater or turacou. See Turacou.
