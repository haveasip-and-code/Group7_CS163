warder
1. One who wards or keeps; a keeper; a guard. \"The warders of the gate.\" Dryden. 2. A truncheon or staff carried by a king or a commander in chief, and used in signaling his will. When, lo! the king suddenly changed his mind, Casts down his warder to arrest them there. Daniel. Wafting his warder thrice about his head, He cast it up with his auspicious hand, Which was the signal, through the English spread, This they should charge. Drayton.
