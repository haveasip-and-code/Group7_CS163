countermarch
To march back, or to march in reversed order. The two armies marched and countermarched, drew near and receded. Macaulay.\n\n1. A marching back; retrocession. 2. (Mil.)  An evolution by which a body of troops change front or reverse the direction of march while retaining the same men in the front rank; also, a movement by which the rear rank becomes the front one, either with or without changing the right to the left. 3. A change of measures; alteration of conduct. Such countermarches and retractions as we do not willingly impute to wisdom. T. Burnet.
