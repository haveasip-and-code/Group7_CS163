intuition
1. A looking after; a regard to. [Obs.] What, no reflection on a reward! He might have an intuition at it, as the encouragement, though not the cause, of his pains. Fuller. 2. Direct apprehension or cognition; immediate knowledge, as in perception or consciousness; -- distinguished from \"mediate\" knowledge, as in reasoning; as, the mind knows by intuition that black is not white, that a circle is not a square, that three are more than two, etc.; quick or ready insight or apprehension. Sagacity and a nameless something more, -- let us call it intuition. Hawthorne. 3. Any object or truth discerned by direct cognition; especially, a first or primary truth.
