wort
1. (Bot.)  A plant of any kind. Note: This word is now chiefly used in combination, as in colewort, figwort, St. John's-wort, woundwort, etc. 2. pl.  Cabbages.\n\nAn infusion of malt which is unfermented, or is in the act of fermentation; the sweet infusion of malt, which ferments and forms beer; hence, any similar liquid in a state of incipient fermentation. Note: Wort consists essentially of a dilute solution of sugar, which by fermentation produces alcohol and carbon dioxide.
