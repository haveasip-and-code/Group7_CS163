bassoon
A wind instrument of the double reed kind, furnished with holes, which are stopped by the fingers, and by keys, as in flutes. It forms the natural bass to the oboe, clarinet, etc. Note: Its compass comprehends three octaves. For convenience of carriage it is divided into two parts; whence it is also called a fagot.
