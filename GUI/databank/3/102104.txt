skepticism
1. An undecided, inquiring state of mind; doubt; uncertainty. That momentary amazement, and irresolution, and confusion, which is the result of skepticism. Hune. 2. (Metaph.)  The doctrine that no fact or principle can be certainly known; the tenet that all knowledge is uncertain; Pyrrohonism; universal doubt; the position that no fact or truth, however worthy of confidence, can be established on philosophical grounds; critical investigation or inquiry, as opposed to the positive assumption or assertion of certain principles. 3. (Theol.)  A doubting of the truth of revelation, or a denial of the divine origin of the Christian religion, or of the being, perfections, or truth of God. Let no . . . secret skepticism lead any one to doubt whether this blessed prospect will be realized. S. Miller.
