plausible
1. Worthy of being applauded; praiseworthy; commendable; ready. [Obs.] Bp. Hacket. 2. Obtaining approbation; specifically pleasing; apparently right; specious; as, a plausible pretext; plausible manners; a plausible delusion. \"Plausible and popular arguments.\" Clarendon. 3. Using specious arguments or discourse; as, a plausible speaker. Syn. -- Plausible, Specious. Plausible denotes that which seems reasonable, yet leaves distrust in the judgment. Specious describes that which presents a fair appearance to the view and yet covers something false. Specious refers more definitely to the act or purpose of false representation; plausible has more reference to the effect on the beholder or hearer. An argument may by specious when it is not plausible because its sophistry is so easily discovered.
