recognizance
1. (Law) (a) An obligation of record entered into before some court of record or magistrate duly authorized, with condition to do some particular act, as to appear at the same or some other court, to keep the peace, or pay a debt. A recognizance differs from a bond, being witnessed by the record only, and not by the party's seal. (b) The verdict of a jury impaneled upon assize. Cowell. Note: Among lawyers the g in this and the related words (except recognize) is usually silent. 2. A token; a symbol; a pledge; a badge. That recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her. Shak. 3. Acknowledgment of a person or thing; avowal; profession; recognition.
