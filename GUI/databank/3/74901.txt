Thus, the small letter under March and opposite 18 is b; b appears again directly over 1904, and at its right is the word Friday. March 18 fell on Friday in 1904, and also in 1898, 1892, etc.  The calendar has other uses, as for finding the months which begin on Sunday in  a particular year, etc. |1753  |1754   |1755   |1750   |1751   |1757   |*1752 |1759  |1765 |*1760  |1761   |*1756  |1763 |1758
