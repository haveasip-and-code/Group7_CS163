scyllaea
A genus of oceanic nudibranchiate mollusks having the small branched gills situated on the upper side of four fleshy lateral lobes, and on the median caudal crest. Note: In color and form these mollusks closely imitate the fronds of sargassum and other floathing seaweeds among which they live.
