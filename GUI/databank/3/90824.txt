nymphaea
A genus of aquatic plants having showy flowers (white, blue, pink, or yellow, often fragrant), including the white water lily and the Egyptia lotus. Note: Recent critics have endeavored to show that this genus should be called Castalia, and the name Nymph√¶a transferred to what is now known as Nuphar.
