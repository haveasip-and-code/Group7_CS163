indenture
1. The act of indenting, or state of being indented. 2. (Law)  A mutual agreement in writing between two or more parties, whereof each party has usually a counterpart or duplicate; sometimes in the pl., a short form for indentures of apprenticeship, the contract by which a youth is bound apprentice to a master. The law is the best expositor of the gospel; they are like a pair of indentures: they answer in every part. C. Leslie. Note: Indentures were originally duplicates, laid together and intended by a notched cut or line, or else written on the same piece of parchment and separated by a notched line so that the two papers or parchments corresponded to each other. But indenting has gradually become a mere form, and is often neglected, while the writings or counterparts retain the name of indentures.\n\n1. To indent; to make hollows, notches, or wrinkles in; to furrow. Though age may creep on, and indenture the brow. Woty. 2. To bind by indentures or written contract; as, to indenture an apprentice.\n\nTo run or wind in and out; to be cut or notched; to indent. Heywood.
