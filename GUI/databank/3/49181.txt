tinsel
1. A shining material used for ornamental purposes; especially, a very thin, gauzelike cloth with much gold or silver woven into it; also, very thin metal overlaid with a thin coating of gold or silver, brass foil, or the like. Who can discern the tinsel from the gold Dryden. 2. Something shining and gaudy; something superficially shining and showy, or having a false luster, and more gay than valuable. O happy peasant! O unhappy bard! His the mere tinsel, hers the rich reward. Cowper.\n\nShowy to excess; gaudy; specious; superficial. \"Tinsel trappings.\" Milton.\n\nTo adorn with tinsel; to deck out with cheap but showy ornaments; to make gaudy. She, tinseled o'er in robes of varying hues. Pope.
