maranatha
\"Our Lord cometh;\" -- an expression used by St. Paul at the conclusion of his first Epistle to the Corinthians (xvi. 22). This word has been used in anathematizing persons for great crimes; as much as to say, \"May the Lord come quickly to take vengeance of thy crimes.\" See Anathema maranatha, under Anathema.
