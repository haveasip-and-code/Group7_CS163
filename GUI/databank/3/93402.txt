wincopipe
A little red flower, no doubt the pimpernel, which, when it opens in the morning, is supposed to bode a fair day. See Pimpernel. There is small red flower in the stubble fields, which country people call the wincopipe; which if it opens in the morning, you may be sure a fair day will follow. Bacon.
