oriel
1. A gallery for minstrels. [Obs.] W. Hamper. 2. A small apartment next a hall, where certain persons were accustomed to dine; a sort of recess. [Obs.] Cowell. 3. (Arch.)  A bay window. See Bay window. The beams that thro' the oriel shine Make prisms in every carven glass. Tennyson. Note: There is no generally admitted difference between a bay window and an oriel. In the United States the latter name is often applied to bay windows which are small, and either polygonal or round; also, to such as are corbeled out from the wall instead of resting on the ground.
