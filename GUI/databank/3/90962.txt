anything
1. Any object, act, state, event, or fact whatever; thing of any kind; something or other; aught; as, I would not do it for anything. Did you ever know of anything so unlucky A. Trollope. They do not know that anything is amiss with them. W. G. Sumner. 2. Expressing an indefinite comparison; -- with as or like. [Colloq. or Lowx] I fear your girl will grow as proud as anything. Richardson. Note: Any thing, written as two words, is now commonly used in contradistinction to any person or anybody. Formerly it was also separated when used in the wider sense. \"Necessity drove them to undertake any thing and venture any thing.\" De Foe. Anything but, not at all or in any respect. \"The battle was a rare one, and the victory anything but secure.\" Hawthorne. -- Anything like, in any respect; at all; as, I can not give anything like a fair sketch of his trials.\n\nIn any measure; anywise; at all. Mine old good will and hearty affection towards you is not . . . anything at all quailed. Robynson (More's Utopia).
