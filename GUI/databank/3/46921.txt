self-sufficient
1. Sufficient for one's self without external aid or co√∂peration. Neglect of friends can never be proved rational till we prove the person using it omnipotent and self-sufficient, and such as can never need any mortal assistance. South. 2. Having an overweening confidence in one's own abilities or worth; hence, haughty; overbearing. \"A rash and self-sufficient manner.\" I. Watts.
