multigraph
A combined rotary type-setting and printing machine for office use. The type is transferred semi-automatically by means of keys from a type-supply drum to a printing drum. The printing may be done by means of an inked ribbon to print \"typewritten\" letters, or directly from inked type or a stereotype plate, as in a printing press.
