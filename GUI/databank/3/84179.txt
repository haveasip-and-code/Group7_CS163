hybridizable
Capable of forming a hybrid, or of being subjected to a hybridizing process; capable of producing a hybrid by union with another species or stock. Hybridizable genera are rarer than is generally supposed, even in gardens where they are so often operated upon, under circumstances most favorable to the production of hybrids. J. D. Hooker.
