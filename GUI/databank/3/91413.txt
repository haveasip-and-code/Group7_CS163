amphibolous
1. Ambiguous; doubtful. [Obs.] Never was there such an amphibolous quarrel -- both parties declaring themselves for the king. Howell. 2. (Logic)  Capable of two meanings. An amphibolous sentence is one that is capable of two meanings, not from the double sense of any of the words, but from its admitting of a double construction; e. g., \"The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose.\" Whately.
