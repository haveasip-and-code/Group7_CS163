antipode
One of the antipodes; anything exactly opposite. In tale or history your beggar is ever the just antipode to your king. Lamb. Note: The singular, antipode, is exceptional in formation, but has been used by good writers. Its regular English plural would be ân\"tî*podes, the last syllable rhyming with abodes, and this pronunciation is sometimes heard. The plural form (originally a Latin word without a singular) is in common use, and is pronounced, after the English method of Latin, ân*tîp\"o*dez.
