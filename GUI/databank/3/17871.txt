theology
The science of God or of religion; the science which treats of the existence, character, and attributes of God, his laws and government, the doctrines we are to believe, and the duties we are to practice; divinity; (as more commonly understood) \"the knowledge derivable from the Scriptures, the systematic exhibition of revealed truth, the science of Christian faith and life.\" Many speak of theology as a science of religion [instead of \"science of God\"] because they disbelieve that there is any knowledge of God to be attained. Prof. R. Flint (Enc. Brit.). Theology is ordered knowledge; representing in the region of the intellect what religion represents in the heart and life of man. Gladstone. Ascetic theology, Natural theology. See Ascetic, Natural. -- Moral theology, that phase of theology which is concerned with moral character and conduct. -- Revealed theology, theology which is to be learned only from revelation. -- Scholastic theology, theology as taught by the scholastics, or as prosecuted after their principles and methods. -- Speculative theology, theology as founded upon, or influenced by, speculation or metaphysical philosophy. -- Systematic theology, that branch of theology of which the aim is to reduce all revealed truth to a series of statements that together shall constitute an organized whole. E. G. Robinson (Johnson's Cyc.).
