trance
1. A tedious journey. [Prov. Eng.] Halliwell. 2. A state in which the soul seems to have passed out of the body into another state of being, or to be rapt into visions; an ecstasy. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance. Acts. x. 10. My soul was ravished quite as in a trance. Spenser. 3. (Med.)  A condition, often simulating death, in which there is a total suspension of the power of voluntary movement, with abolition of all evidences of mental activity and the reduction to a minimum of all the vital functions so that the patient lies still and apparently unconscious of surrounding objects, while the pulsation of the heart and the breathing, although still present, are almost or altogether imperceptible. He fell down in a trance. Chaucer.\n\n1. To entrance. And three I left him tranced. Shak. 2. To pass over or across; to traverse. [Poetic] Trance the world over. Beau. & Fl. When thickest dark did trance the sky. Tennyson.\n\nTo pass; to travel. [Obs.]
