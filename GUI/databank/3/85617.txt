pipa
The Surinam toad (Pipa Americana), noted for its peculiar breeding habits. Note: The male places the eggs on the back of the female, where they soon become inclosed in capsules formed by the thickening of the skin. The incubation of the eggs takes place in the capsules, and the young, when hatched, come forth with well developed legs.
