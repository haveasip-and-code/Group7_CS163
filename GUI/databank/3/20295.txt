Note: The form of the question is: \"Shall the main question be now put\" If the vote is in the affirmative, the matter before the body must be voted upon as it then stands, without further general debate or the submission of new amendments. In the House of Representatives of the United States, and generally in America, a negative decision operates to keep the business before the body as if the motion had not been made; but in the English Parliament, it operates to postpone consideration for the day, and until the subject may be again introduced. In American practice, the object of the motion is to hasten action, and it is made by a friend of the measure. In English practice, the object is to get rid of the subject for the time being, and the motion is made with a purpose of voting against it. Cushing. -- To beg the question. See under Beg. -- To the question, to the point in dispute; to the real matter under debate. Syn. -- Point; topic; subject.\n\n1. To ask questions; to inquire.

To inquire is merely to ask for information, and implies no authority in the one who asks.
