accessory
Accompanying as a subordinate; aiding in a secondary way; additional; connected as an incident or subordinate to a principal; contributing or contributory; said of persons and things, and, when of persons, usually in a bad sense; as, he was accessory to the riot; accessory sounds in music. Note: Ash accents the antepenult; and this is not only more regular, but preferable, on account of easiness of pronunciation. Most orhoÃ«pists place the accent on the first syllable.
