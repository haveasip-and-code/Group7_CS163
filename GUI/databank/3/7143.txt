congo
Black tea, of higher grade (finer leaf and less dusty) than the present bohea. See Tea. Of black teas, the great mass is called Congou, or the \"well worked\", a name which took the place of the Bohea of 150 years ago, and is now itself giving way to the term \"English breakfast tea.\" S. W. Williams.
