pity
1. Piety. [Obs.] Wyclif. 2. A feeling for the sufferings or distresses of another or others; sympathy with the grief or misery of another; compassion; fellow- feeling; commiseration. He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord. Prov. xix. 17. He . . . has no more pity in him than a dog. Shak. 3. A reason or cause of pity, grief, or regret; a thing to be regretted. \"The more the pity.\" Shak. What pity is it That we can die but once to serve our country! Addison. Note: In this sense, sometimes used in the plural, especially in the colloquialism: \"It is a thousand pities.\" Syn. -- Compassion; mercy; commiseration; condolence; sympathy, fellow- suffering; fellow-feeling. -- Pity, Sympathy, Compassion. Sympathy is literally fellow-feeling, and therefore requiers a certain degree of equality in situation, circumstances, etc., to its fullest exercise. Compassion is deep tenderness for another under severe or inevitable misfortune. Pity regards its object not only as suffering, but weak, and hence as inferior.\n\n1.
