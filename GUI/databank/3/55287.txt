cockshy
1. A game in which trinkets are set upon sticks, to be thrown at by the players; -- so called from an ancient popular sport which consisted in \"shying\" or throwing cudgels at live cocks. 2. An object at which stones are flung. \"Making a cockshy of him,\" replied the hideous small boy. Dickens.
