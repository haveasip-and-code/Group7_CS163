koumiss
An intoxicating fermented or distilled liquor originally made by the Tartars from mare's or camel's milk. It can be obtained from any kind of milk, and is now largely made in Europe. [Written also koumyss, kumiss, kumish, and kumys.] Koumiss has from time immemorial served the Tartar instead of wine or spirits. J. H. Newman.
