background
1. Ground in the rear or behind, or in the distance, as opposed to the foreground, or the ground in front. 2. (Paint.)  The space which is behind and subordinate to a portrait or group of figures. Note: The distance in a picture is usually divided into foreground, middle distance, and background. Fairholt. 3. Anything behind, serving as a foil; as, the statue had a background of red hangings. 4. A place in obscurity or retirement, or out of sight. I fancy there was a background of grinding and waiting before Miss Torry could produce this highly finished . . . performance. Mrs. Alexander. A husband somewhere in the background. Thackeray.
