underworld
1. The lower of inferior world; the world which is under the heavens; the earth. That overspreads (with such a reverence) This underworld. Daniel. 2. The mythological place of departed souls; Hades. 3. The portion of the world which is below the horizon; the opposite side of the world; the antipodes. [R.] Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail, That brings our friends up from the underworld. Tennyson. 4. The inferior part of mankind. [R.] Atterbury.
