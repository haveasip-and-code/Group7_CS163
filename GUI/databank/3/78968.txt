eureka
The exclamation attributed to Archimedes, who is said to have cried out \"Eureka! eureka!\" (I have found it! I have found it!), upon suddenly discovering a method of finding out how much the gold of King Hiero's crown had been alloyed. Hence, an expression of triumph concerning a discovery.
