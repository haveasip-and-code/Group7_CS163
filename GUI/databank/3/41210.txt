carpophyte
A flowerless plant which forms a true fruit as the result of fertilization, as the red seaweeds, the Ascomycetes, etc. Note: The division of alge and fungi into four classes called Carpophytes, Oöphytes, Protophytes, and Zygophytes (or Carposporeæ, Oösporeæ, Protophyta, and Zygosporeæ) was proposed by Sachs about 1875.
