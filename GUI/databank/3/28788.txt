apode
One of certain animals that have no feet or footlike organs; esp. one of certain fabulous birds which were said to have no feet. Note: The bird of paradise formerly had the name Paradisea apoda, being supposed to have no feet, as these were wanting in the specimens first obtained from the East Indies.
