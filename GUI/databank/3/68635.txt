interrogation
1. The act of interrogating or questioning; examination by questions; inquiry. 2. A question put; an inquiry. 3. A point, mark, or sign, thus [], indicating that the sentence with which it is connected is a question. It is used to express doubt, or to mark a query. Called also interrogation point. Note: In works printed in the Spanish language this mark is not only placed at the end of an interrogative sentence, but is also placed, inverted [as thus (Â¿)], at the beginning.
