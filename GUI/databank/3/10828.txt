his
1. Belonging or pertaining to him; -- used as a pronominal adjective or adjective pronoun; as, tell John his papers are ready; formerly used also for its, but this use is now obsolete. No comfortable star did lend his light. Shak. Who can impress the forest, bid the tree Unfix his earth-bound root Shak. Note: Also formerly used in connection with a noun simply as a sign of the possessive. \"The king his son.\" Shak. \"By young Telemachus his blooming years.\" Pope. This his is probably a corruption of the old possessive ending -is or -es, which, being written as a separate word, was at length confounded with the pronoun his. 2. The possessive of he; as, the book is his. \"The sea is his, and he made it.\" Ps. xcv. 5.
