sarracenia
A genus of American perrenial herbs growing in bogs; the American pitcher plant. Note: They have hollow pitcher-shaped or tubular leaves, and solitary flowers with an umbrella-shaped style. Sarracenia purpurea, the sidesaddle flower, is common at the North; S. flava, rubra, Drummondii, variolaris, and psittacina are Southern species. All are insectivorous, catching and drowning insects in their curious leaves. See Illust. of Sidesaddle flower, under Sidesaddle.
