galvanism
(a) Electricity excited by the mutual action of certain liquids and metals; dynamical electricity. (b) The branch of physical science which treats of dynamical elecricity, or the properties and effects of electrical currents. Note: The words galvanism and galvanic, formerly in very general use, are now rarely employed. For the latter, voltaic, from the name of Volta, is commonly used.
