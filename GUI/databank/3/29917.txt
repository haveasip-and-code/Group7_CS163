pax
1. (Eccl.)  The kiss of peace; also, the embrace in the sanctuary now substituted for it at High Mass in Roman Catholic churches. 2. (R. C. Ch.)  A tablet or board, on which is a representation of Christ, of the Virgin Mary, or of some saint and which, in the Mass, was kissed by the priest and then by the people, in medi√¶val times; an osculatory. It is still used in communities, confraternities, etc. Kiss the pax, and be quiet like your neighbors. Chapman.
