flee
To run away, as from danger or evil; to avoid in an alarmed or cowardly manner; to hasten off; -- usually with from. This is sometimes omitted, making the verb transitive. [He] cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. Shak. Flee fornication. 1 Cor. vi. 18. So fled his enemies my warlike father. Shak. Note: When great speed is to be indicated, we commonly use fly, not flee; as, fly hence to France with the utmost speed. \"Whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands\" Shak. See Fly, v. i., 5.
