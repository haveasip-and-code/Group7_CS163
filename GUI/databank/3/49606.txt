yea
1. Yes; ay; a word expressing assent, or an affirmative, or an affirmative answer to a question, now superseded by yes. See Yes. Let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay. Matt. v. 37. 2. More than this; not only so, but; -- used to mark the addition of a more specific or more emphatic clause. Cf. Nay, adv., 2. I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. Phil. i. 18. Note: Yea sometimes introduces a clause, with the sense of indeed, verily, truly. \"Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden\" Gen. iii. 1.\n\nAn affirmative vote; one who votes in the affirmative; as, a vote by yeas and nays. Note: In the Scriptures, yea is used as a sign of certainty or stability. \"All the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen.\" 2 Cor. i. 20.
