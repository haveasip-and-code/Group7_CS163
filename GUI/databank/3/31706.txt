forgo
To pass by; to leave. See 1st Forego. For sith [since] I shall forgoon my liberty At your request. Chaucer. And four [days] since Florimell the court forwent. Spenser. Note: This word in spelling has been confused with, and almost superseded by, forego to go before. Etymologically the form forgo is correct.
