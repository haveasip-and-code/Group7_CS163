thereafter
1. After that; afterward. 2. According to that; accordingly. I deny not but that it is of greatest concernment in the church and commonwealth to have a vigilant eye how books demean themselves as well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors. Milton. 3. Of that sort. [Obs.] \"My audience is not thereafter.\" Latimer.
