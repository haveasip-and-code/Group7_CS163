taille

The taille, as it still subsists in France, may serve as an example of those ancient tallages. It was a tax upon the profits of the farmer, which they estimate by the stock that he has upon the farm. A. Smith. 3. (Mus.)  The French name for the tenor voice or part; also, for the tenor viol or viola.
