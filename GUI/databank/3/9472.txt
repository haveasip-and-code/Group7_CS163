pteropoda
A class of Mollusca in which the anterior lobes of the foot are developed in the form of broad, thin, winglike organs, with which they swim at near the surface of the sea. Note: The Pteropoda are divided into two orders: Cymnosomata, which have the body entirely naked and the head distinct from the wings; and Thecosomata, which have a delicate transparent shell of various forms, and the head not distinct from the wings.
