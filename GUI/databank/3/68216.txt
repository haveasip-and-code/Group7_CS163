These words agree in representing a thing as large, but under different relations, according to the image which is used. Ample implies largeness, producing a sufficiency or fullness of supply for every want; as, ample stores or resources, ample provision. Copious carries with it the idea of flow, or of collection at a single point; as, a copious supply of materials. \"Copious matter of my song.\" Milton. Abundant and plenteous refer to largeness of quantity; as, abundant stores; plenteous harvests.
