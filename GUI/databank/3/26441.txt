putative
Commonly thought or deemed; supposed; reputed; as, the putative father of a child. \"His other putative (I dare not say feigned) friends.\" E. Hall. Thus things indifferent, being esteemed useful or pious, became customary, and then came for reverence into a putative and usurped authority. Jer. Taylor.
