antedate
1. Prior date; a date antecedent to another which is the actual date. 2. Anticipation. [Obs.] Donne.\n\n1. To date before the true time; to assign to an earlier date; thus, to antedate a deed or a bond is to give it a date anterior to the true time of its execution. 2. To precede in time. 3. To anticipate; to make before the true time. And antedate the bliss above. Pope. Who rather rose the day to antedate. Wordsworth.
