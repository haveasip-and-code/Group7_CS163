It is used for covering small cases and boxes. 2. The skin of various small sharks and other fishes when having small, rough, bony scales. The dogfishes of the genus Scyllium furnish a large part of that used in the arts.\n\n1. Made or covered with the leather called shagreen. \"A shagreen case of lancets.\" T. Hook. 2. (Zo√∂l.)
