bote
(a) Compensation; amends; satisfaction; expiation; as, man bote, a compensation or a man slain. (b) Payment of any kind. Bouvier. (c) A privilege or allowance of necessaries. Note: This word is still used in composition as equivalent to the French estovers, supplies, necessaries; as, housebote, a sufficiency of wood to repair a house, or for fuel, sometimes called firebote; so plowbote, cartbote, wood for making or repairing instruments of husbandry; haybote or hedgebote, wood for hedges, fences, etc. These were privileges enjoyed by tenants under the feudal system.
