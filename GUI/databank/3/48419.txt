amuck
In a frenzied and reckless. To run amuck, to rush out in a state of frenzy, as the Malays sometimes do under the influence of \"bhang,\" and attack every one that comes in the way; to assail recklessly and indiscriminately. Satire's my weapon, but I'm too discreet To run amuck, and tilt at all I meet. Pope.
