1. A defeat; an overthrow. [Obs.] After his foes' defeasance. Spenser. 2. A rendering null or void. 3. (Law)  A condition, relating to a deed, which being performed, the deed is defeated or rendered void; or a collateral deed, made at the same time with a feoffment, or other conveyance, containing conditions, on the performance of which the estate then created may be defeated.
