inanition
The condition of being inane; emptiness; want of fullness, as in the vessels of the body; hence, specifically, exhaustion from want of food, either from partial or complete starvation, or from a disorder of the digestive apparatus, producing the same result. Feeble from inanition, inert from weariness. Landor. Repletion and inanition may both do harm in two contrary extremes. Burton.
