antipodes
1. Those who live on the side of the globe diametrically opposite. 2. The country of those who live on the opposite side of the globe. Latham. 3. Anything exactly opposite or contrary. Can there be a greater contrariety unto Christ's judgment, a more perfect antipodes to all that hath hitherto been gospel Hammond.
