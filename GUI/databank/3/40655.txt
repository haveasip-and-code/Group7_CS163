recidivism
The state or quality of being recidivous; relapse, specif. (Criminology),  a falling back or relapse into prior criminal habits, esp. after conviction and punishment. The old English system of recognizances, in which the guilty party deposits a sum of money, is an excellent guarantee to society against recidivism. Havelock Ellis.
