merrythought
The forked bone of a fowl's breast; -- called also wishbone. See Furculum. Note: It is a sportive custom for two persons to break this bone by pulling the ends apart to see who will get the longer piece, the securing of which is regarded as a lucky omen, signifying that the person holding it will obtain the gratification of some secret wish.
