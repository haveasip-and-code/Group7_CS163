grove
The original sense seems to have been a lane cut through trees. See Grave, v., and cf. Groove.] A smaller group of trees than a forest, and without underwood, planted, or growing naturally as if arranged by art; a wood of small extent. Note: The Hebrew word Asherah, rendered grove in the Authorized Version of the Bible, is left untranslated in the Revised Version. Almost all modern interpreters agree that by Asherah an idol or image of some kind is intended.
