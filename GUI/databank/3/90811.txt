paraleipsis
A pretended or apparent omission; a figure by which a speaker artfully pretends to pass by what he really mentions; as, for example, if an orator should say, \"I do not speak of my adversary's scandalous venality and rapacity, his brutal conduct, his treachery and malice.\" [Written also paralepsis, paralepsy, paralipsis.]
