gunter rig
A topmast arranged with metal bands so that it will readily slide up and down the lower mast. GUNTER'S CHAIN Gun\"ter's chain`. (Surveying)  The chain ordinarily used in measuring land. See Chain, n., 4, and Gunter's scale. GUNTER'S LINE Gun\"ter's line`.  A logarithmic line on Gunter's scale, used for performing the multiplication and division of numbers mechanically by the dividers; -- called also line of lines, and line of numbers. GUNTER'S QUADRANT Gun\"ter's quad`rant.  A thin quadrant, made of brass, wood, etc., showing a stereographic projection on the plane of the equator. By it are found the hour of the day, the sun's azimuth, the altitude of objects in degrees, etc. See Gunter's scale. GUNTER'S SCALE Gun\"ter's scale`.  A scale invented by the Rev. Edmund Gunter (1581-1626), a professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London, who invented also Gunter's chain, and Gunter's quadrant. Note: Gunter's scale is a wooden rule, two feet long, on one side of which are marked scales of equal parts, of chords, sines, tangents, rhombs, etc., and on the other side scales of logarithms of these various parts, by means of which many problems in surveying and navigation may be solved, mechanically, by the aid of dividers alone.
