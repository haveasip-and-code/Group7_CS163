melody
1. A sweet or agreeable succession of sounds. Lulled with sound of sweetest melody. Shak. 2. (Mus.)  A rhythmical succession of single tones, ranging for the most part within a given key, and so related together as to form a musical whole, having the unity of what is technically called a musical thought, at once pleasing to the ear and characteristic in expression. Note: Melody consists in a succession of single tones; harmony is a consonance or agreement of tones, also a succession of consonant musical combinations or chords. 3. The air or tune of a musical piece. Syn. -- See Harmony.
