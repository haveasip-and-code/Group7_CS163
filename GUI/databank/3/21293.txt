Experience from the time past to the time present. Bacon. The song began from Jove. Drpden. From high MÃ¦onia's rocky shores I came. Addison. If the wind blow any way from shore. Shak. Note: From sometimes denotes away from, remote from, inconsistent with. \"Anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing.\" Shak. From, when joined with another preposition or an adverb, gives an opportunity for abbreviating the sentence. \"There followed him great multitudes of people . . . from [the land] beyond Jordan.\" Math. iv. 25. In certain constructions, as from forth, from out, etc., the ordinary and more obvious arrangment is inverted, the sense being more distinctly forth from, out from -- from being virtually the governing preposition, and the word the adverb.
