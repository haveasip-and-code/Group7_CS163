colligation
1. A binding together. Sir T. Browne. 2. (Logic)  That process by which a number of isolated facts are brought under one conception, or summed up in a general proposition, as when Kepler discovered that the various observed positions of the planet Mars were points in an ellipse. \"The colligation of facts.\" Whewell. Colligation is not always induction, but induction is always colligation. J. S. Mill.
