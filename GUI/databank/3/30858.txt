m
1. M, the thirteenth letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal consonant, and from the manner of its formation, is called the labio- nasal consonant. See Guide to Pronunciation, §§ 178-180, 242. The letter M came into English from the Greek, through the Latin, the form of the Greek letter being further derived from the Phonician, and ultimately, it is believed, from the Egyptian. Etymologically M is related to n, in lime, linden; emmet, ant; also to b. M is readily followed by b and p. the position of the lips in the formation of both letters being the same. The relation of b and m is the same as that of d and t to n. and that of g and k to ng. 2. As a numeral, M stands for one thousand, both in English and Latin.\n\n1. (Print.)
