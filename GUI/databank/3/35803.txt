female fern
a common species of fern with large decompound fronds (Asplenium Filixf√¶mina), growing in many countries; lady fern. Note: The names male fern and female fern were anciently given to two common ferns; but it is now understood that neither has any sexual character. Syn. -- Female, Feminine. We apply female to the sex or individual, as opposed to male; also, to the distinctive belongings of women; as, female dress, female form, female character, etc.; feminine, to things appropriate to, or affected by, women; as, feminine studies, employments, accomplishments, etc. \"Female applies to sex rather than gender, and is a physiological rather than a grammatical term. Feminine applies to gender rather than sex, and is grammatical rather than physiological.\" Latham.
