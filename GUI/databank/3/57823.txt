dotted
Marked with, or made of, dots or small spots; diversified with small, detached objects. Dotted note (Mus.), a note followed by a dot to indicate an increase of length equal to one half of its simple value; thus, a dotted semibreve is equal to three minims, and a dotted quarter to three eighth notes. -- Dotted rest, a rest lengthened by a dot in the same manner as a dotted note. Note: Notes and rests are sometimes followed by two dots, to indicate an increase of length equal to three quarters of their simple value, and they are then said to be double-dotted.
