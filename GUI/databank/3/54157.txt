cabala
1. A kind of occult theosophy or traditional interpretation of the Scriptures among Jewish rabbis and certain medi√¶val Christians, which treats of the nature of god and the mystery of human existence. It assumed that every letter, word, number, and accent of Scripture contains a hidden sense; and it teaches the methods of interpretation for ascertaining these occult meanings. The cabalists pretend even to foretell events by this means. 2. Secret science in general; mystic art; mystery.
