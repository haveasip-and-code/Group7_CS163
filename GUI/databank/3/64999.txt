picric
Pertaining to, or designating, a strong organic acid (called picric acid), intensely bitter. Note: Picric acid is obtained by treating phenol with strong nitric acid, as a brilliant yellow crystalline substance, C6H2(NO2)3.OH. It is used in dyeing silk and wool, and also in the manufacture of explosives, as it is very unstable when heated. Called also trinitrophenol, and formerly carbazotic acid.
