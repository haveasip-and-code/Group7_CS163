salutation
The act of saluting, or paying respect or reverence, by the customary words or actions; the act of greeting, or expressing good will or courtesy; also, that which is uttered or done in saluting or greeting. In all public meetings or private addresses, use those forms of salutation, reverence, and decency usual amongst the most sober persons. Jer. Taylor. Syn. -- Greeting; salute; address. -- Salutation, Greeting, Salute, Greeting is the general word for all manner of expressions of recognition, agreeable or otherwise, made when persons meet or communicate with each other. A greeting may be hearty and loving, chilling and offensive, or merely formal, as in the opening sentence of legal documents. Salutation more definitely implies a wishing well, and is used of expressions at parting as well as at meeting. It is used especially of uttered expressions of good will. Salute, while formerly and sometimes still in the sense of either greeting or salutation, is now used specifically to denote a conventional demonstration not expressed in words. The guests received a greeting which relieved their embrassment, offered their salutations in well-chosen terms, and when they retired, as when they entered, made a deferential salute. Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets. Luke xi. 43. When Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. Luke i. 41. I shall not trouble my reader with the first salutes of our three friends. Addison.
