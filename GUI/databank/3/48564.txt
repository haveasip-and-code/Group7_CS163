philopena
A present or gift which is made as a forfeit in a social game that is played in various ways; also, the game itself. [Written also fillipeen and phillippine.] Note: One of the ways may be stated as follows: A person finding a nut with two kernels eats one, and gives the other to a person of the opposite sex, and then whichever says philopena first at the next meeting wins the present. The name is also applied to the kernels eaten.
