coefficient
Co√∂perating; acting together to produce an effect. Co`ef*fi\"cient*ly, adv.\n\n1. That which unites in action with something else to produce the same effect. 2. Etym: [Cf. F. coefficient.] (Math.)  A number or letter put before a letter or quantity, known or unknown, to show how many times the latter is to be taken; as, 6x; bx; here 6 and b are coefficients of x. 3. (Physics)  A number, commonly used in computation as a factor, expressing the amount of some change or effect under certain fixed conditions as to temperature, length, volume, etc.; as, the coefficient of expansion; the coefficient of friction. Arbitrary coefficient (Math.), a literal coefficient placed arbitrarily in an algebraic, expression, the value of the coefficient being afterwards determined by the conditions of the problem.
