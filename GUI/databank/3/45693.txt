bank bill
1. In America (and formerly in England), a promissory note of a bank payable to the bearer on demand, and used as currency; a bank note. 2. In England, a note, or a bill of exchange, of a bank, payable to order, and usually at some future specified time. Such bills are negotiable, but form, in the strict sense of the term, no part of the currency.
