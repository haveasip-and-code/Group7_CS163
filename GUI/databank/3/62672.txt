taylor-white process
A process (invented about 1899 by Frederick W. Taylor and Maunsel B. White) for giving toughness to self-hardening steels. The steel is heated almost to fusion, cooled to a temperature of from 700ยบ to 850ยบ C. in molten lead, further cooled in oil, reheated to between 370ยบ and 670ยบ C., and cooled in air.
