Skill is more intelligent, denoting familiar knowledge united to readiness of performance. Dexterity, when applied to the body, is more mechanical, and refers to habitual ease of execution. Adroitness involves the same image with dexterity, and differs from it as implaying a general facility of movement (especially in avoidance of danger or in escaping from a difficalty). The same distinctions apply to the figurative sense of the words. A man is skillful in any employment when he understands both its theory and its practice. He is dexterous when he maneuvers with great lightness. He is adroit in the use od quick, sudden, and well- directed movements of the body or the mind, so as to effect the object he has in view.\n\nTo know; to understand. [Obs.] To skill the arts of expressing our mind. Barrow.\n\n1. To be knowing; to have understanding; to be dexterous in performance. [Obs.] I can not skill of these thy ways. Herbert. 2. To make a difference; to signify; to matter; -- used impersonally. Spenser. What skills it, if a bag of stones or gold About thy neck do drown thee Herbert. It skills not talking of it. Sir W. Scott.
