ustulation
1. The act of burning or searing. [R.] Sir W. Petty. 2. (Old Chem.)  The operation of expelling one substance from another by heat, as sulphur or arsenic from ores, in a muffle. 3. (Pharm.) (a) The roasting or drying of moist substances so as prepare them for pulverizing. (b) The burning of wine. 4. Lascivious passion; concupiscence. [Obs.] It is not certain that they took the better part when they chose ustulation before marriage, expressly against the apostle. Jer. Taylor.
