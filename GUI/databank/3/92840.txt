joulemeter
An integrating wattmeter for measuring the energy in joules expended in an electric circuit or developed by a machine. JOULE'S CYCLE Joule's cycle. (Thermodynamics)  The cycle for the air engine proposed by Joule. In it air is taken by a pump from a cold chamber and compressed adiabatically until its pressure is eqal to that of the air in a hot chamber, into which it is then delivered, thereby displacing an equal amount of hot air into the engine cylinder. Here it expands adiabatically to the temperature of the cold chamber into which it is finally exhausted. This cycle, reversed, is used in refrigerating machines. JOULE'S LAW Joule's law. 1. (Elec.)  The law that the rate at which heat is produced in any part of an electric circuit is measured by the product of the square of the current into the resistance of that part of the circuit. If the current (i) is constant for an interval of time (t), the energy (H) in heat units equals i2Rt, R being resistance. 2. (Thermodynamics) The law that there is no change of temperature when a gas expands without doing external work and without receiving or rejecting heat.
