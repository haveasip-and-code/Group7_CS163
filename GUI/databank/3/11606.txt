Dislike is the more general term, applicable to both persons and things and arising either from feeling or judgment. It may mean little more than want of positive liking; but antipathy, repugnance, disgust, and aversion are more intense phases of dislike. Aversion denotes a fixed and habitual dislike; as, an aversion to or for business. Reluctance and repugnance denote a mental strife or hostility something proposed (repugnance being the stronger); as, a reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices, and a repugnance to the submission required. Disgust is repugnance either of taste or moral feeling; as, a disgust at gross exhibitions of selfishness. Antipathy is primarily an instinctive feeling of dislike of a thing, such as most persons feel for a snake. When used figuratively, it denotes a correspondent dislike for certain persons, modes of acting, etc. Men have an aversion to what breaks in upon their habits; a reluctance and repugnance to what crosses their will; a disgust at what offends their sensibilities; and are often governed by antipathies for which they can give no good reason.
