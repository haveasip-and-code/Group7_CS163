shaker
1. A person or thing that shakes, or by means of which something is shaken. 2. One of a religious sect who do not marry, popularly so called from the movements of the members in dancing, which forms a part of their worship. Note: The sect originated in England in 1747, and came to the United States in 1774, under the leadership of Mother Ann Lee. The Shakers are sometimes nicknamed Shaking Quakers, but they differ from the Quakers in doctrine and practice. They style themselves the \"United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing.\" The sect is now confined in the United States. 3. (Zo√∂l.)  A variety of pigeon. P. J. Selby.
