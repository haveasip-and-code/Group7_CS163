In one way or another; in some way not yet known or designated; by some means; as, the thing must be done somehow; he lives somehow. By their action upon one another they may be swelled somehow, so as to shorten the length. Cheyne. Note: The indefiniteness of somehow is emphasized by the addition of or other. Although youngest of the familly, he has somehow or other got the entire management of all the others. Sir W. Scott.
