thy
Of thee, or belonging to thee; the more common form of thine, possessive case of thou; -- used always attributively, and chiefly in the solemn or grave style, and in poetry. Thine is used in the predicate; as, the knife is thine. See Thine. Our father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. Matt. vi. 9,10. These are thy glorious works, Parent of good. Milton.
