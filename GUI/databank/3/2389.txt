homicide
1. The killing of one human being by another. Note: Homicide is of three kinds: justifiable, as when the killing is performed in the exercise of a right or performance of a duty; excusable, as when done, although not as duty or right, yet without culpable or criminal intent; and felonious, or involving what the law terms malice; the latter may be either manslaughter or murder. Bouvier. 2. One who kills another; a manslayer. Chaucer. Shak.
