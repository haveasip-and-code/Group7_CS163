ribald
A low, vulgar, brutal, foul-mouthed wretch; a lewd fellow. Spenser. Pope. Ribald was almost a class name in the feudal system . . . He was his patron's parasite, bulldog, and tool . . . It is not to be wondered at that the word rapidly became a synonym for everything ruffianly and brutal. Earle.\n\nLow; base; mean; filthy; obscene. The busy day, Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows. Shak.
