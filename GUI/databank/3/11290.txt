metaphor
The transference of the relation between one set of objects to another set for the purpose of brief explanation; a compressed simile; e. g., the ship plows the sea. Abbott & Seeley. \"All the world's a stage.\" Shak. Note: The statement, \"that man is a fox,\" is a metaphor; but \"that man is like a fox,\" is a simile, similitude, or comparison.
