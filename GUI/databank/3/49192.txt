hunger
1. An uneasy sensation occasioned normally by the want of food; a craving or desire for food. Note: The sensation of hunger is usually referred to the stomach, but is probably dependent on excitation of the sensory nerves, both of the stomach and intestines, and perhaps also on indirect impressions from other organs, more or less exhausted from lack of nutriment. 2. Any strong eager desire. O sacred hunger of ambitious minds! Spenser. For hunger of my gold I die. Dryden.\n\n1. To feel the craving or uneasiness occasioned by want of food; to be oppressed by hunger. 2. To have an eager desire; to long. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteouness. Matt. v. 6.\n\nTo make hungry; to famish.
