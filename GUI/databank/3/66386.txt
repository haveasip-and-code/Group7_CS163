subordinary
One of several heraldic bearings somewhat less common than an ordinary. See Ordinary. Note: Different writers name different bearings as subordinaries, but the bar, bend, sinister, pile, inescutcheon bordure, gyron, and quarter, are always considered subordinaries by those who do not class them as ordinaries.
