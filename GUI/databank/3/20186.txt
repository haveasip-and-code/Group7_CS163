whither
1. To what place; -- used interrogatively; as, whither goest thou \"Whider may I flee\" Chaucer. Sir Valentine, whither away so fast Shak. 2. To what or which place; -- used relatively. That no man should know . . . whither that he went. Chaucer. We came unto the land whither thou sentest us. Num. xiii. 27. 3. To what point, degree, end, conclusion, or design; whereunto; whereto; -- used in a sense not physical. Nor have I . . . whither to appeal. Milton. Any whither, to any place; anywhere. [Obs.] \"Any whither, in hope of life eternal.\" Jer. Taylor. -- No whither, to no place; nowhere. [Obs.] 2 Kings v. 25. Syn. -- Where. -- Whither, Where. Whither properly implies motion to place, and where rest in a place. Whither is now, however, to a great extent, obsolete, except in poetry, or in compositions of a grave and serious character and in language where precision is required. Where has taken its place, as in the question, \"Where are you going\"
