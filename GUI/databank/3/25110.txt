unconformity
1. Want of conformity; incongruity; inconsistency. South. 2. (Geol.)  Want of parallelism between strata in contact. Note: With some authors unconformity is equivalent to unconformability; but it is often used more broadly, for example, to include the case when the parallelism of strata once conformable has been disturbed by faulting and the like.
