brush turkey
A large, edible, gregarious bird of Australia (Talegalla Lathami) of the family Megapodid√¶. Also applied to several allied species of New Guinea. Note: The brush turkeys live in the \"brush,\" and construct a common nest by collecting a large heap of decaying vegetable matter, which generates heat sufficient to hatch the numerous eggs (sometimes half a bushel) deposited in it by the females of the flock.
