Stillingfleet. Syn. -- Tour; excursion; trip; expedition; pilgrimage. -- Journey, Tour, Excursion, Pilgrimage. The word journey suggests the idea of a somewhat prolonged traveling for a specific object, leading a person to pass directly from one point to another. In a tour, we take a roundabout course from place to place, more commonly for pleasure, though sometimes on business. An excursion is usually a brief tour or trip for pleasure, health, etc. In a pilgrimage we travel to a place hallowed by our religions affections, or by some train of sacred or tender associations. A journey on important business; the tour of Europe; an excursion to the lakes; a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\n\nTo travel from place to place; to go from home to a distance. Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. Gen. xii. 9.\n\nTo traverse; to travel over or through. [R.] \"I journeyed many a land.\" Sir W. Scott.
