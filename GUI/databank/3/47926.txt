enormous
1. Exceeding the usual rule, norm, or measure; out of due proportion; inordinate; abnormal. \"Enormous bliss.\" Milton. \"This enormous state.\" Shak. \"The hoop's enormous size.\" Jenyns. Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait. Milton. 2. Exceedingly wicked; outrageous; atrocious; monstrous; as, an enormous crime. That detestable profession of a life so enormous. Bale. Syn. -- Huge; vast; immoderate; immense; excessive; prodigious; monstrous. -- Enormous, Immense, Excessive. We speak of a thing as enormous when it overpasses its ordinary law of existence or far exceeds its proper average or standard, and becomes -- so to speak -- abnormal in its magnitude, degree, etc.; as, a man of enormous strength; a deed of enormous wickedness. Immense expresses somewhat indefinitely an immeasurable quantity or extent. Excessive is applied to what is beyond a just measure or amount, and is always used in an evil; as, enormous size; an enormous crime; an immense expenditure; the expanse of ocean is immense. \"Excessive levity and indulgence are ultimately excessive rigor.\" V. Knox. \"Complaisance becomes servitude when it is excessive.\" La Rochefoucauld (Trans).
