intercession
The act of interceding; mediation; interposition between parties at variance, with a view to reconcilation; prayer, petition, or entreaty in favor of, or (less often) against, another or others. But the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered. Rom. viii. 26.
