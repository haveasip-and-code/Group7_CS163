And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom. Matt. iv. 23. The steadfast belief of the promises of the gospel. Bentley. Note: It is probable that gospel is from. OE. godspel, God story, the narrative concerning God; but it was early confused with god spell, good story, good tidings, and was so used by the translators of the Authorized version of Scripture. This use has been retained in most cases in the Revised Version. Thus the literal sense [of gospel] is the \"narrative of God,\" i. e., the life of Christ. Skeat. 2. One of the four narratives of the life and death of Jesus Christ, written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. 3. A selection from one of the gospels, for use in a religious service; as, the gospel for the day. 4. Any system of religious doctrine; sometimes, any system of political doctrine or social philosophy; as, this political gospel. Burke. 5. Anything propounded or accepted as infallibly true; as, they took his words for gospel. [Colloq.] If any one thinks this expression hyperbolical, I shall only ask him to read , instead of taking the traditional witticisms about Lee for gospel.
