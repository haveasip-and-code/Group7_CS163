raspberry
(a) The thimble-shaped fruit of the Rubus Id√¶us and other similar brambles; as, the black, the red and the white raspberry. (b) The shrub bearing this fruit. Note: Technically, raspberries are those brambles in which the fruit separates readily from the core or receptacle, in this differing from the blackberries, in which the fruit is firmly attached to the receptacle.
