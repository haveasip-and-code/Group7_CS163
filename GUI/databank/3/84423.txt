confection
1. A composition of different materials. [Obs.] A new confection of mold. Bacon. 2. A preparation of fruits or roots, etc., with sugar; a sweetmeat. Certain confections . . . are like to candied conserves, and are made of sugar and lemons. Bacon. 3. A composition of drugs. Shak. 4. (Med.)  A soft solid made by incorporating a medicinal substance or substances with sugar, sirup, or honey. Note: The pharmacopoeias formerly made a distinction between conserves (made of fresh vegetable substances and sugar) and electuaries (medicinal substances combined with sirup or honey), but the distinction is now abandoned and all are called confections.
