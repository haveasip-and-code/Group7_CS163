rarity
1. The quality or state of being rare; rareness; thinness; as, the rarity (contrasted with the density) of gases. 2. That which is rare; an uncommon thing; a thing valued for its scarcity. I saw three rarities of different kinds, which pleased me more than any other shows in the place. Addison.
