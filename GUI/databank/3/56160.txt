[R.] Better, however, to be a flippant, than, by a revolting form of tumor and perplexity, to lead men into habits of intellect such as result from the modern vice of English style. De Quincey. Encysted tumor, a tumor which is inclosed in a membrane called a cyst, connected with the surrounding parts by the neighboring cellular substance. -- Fatty tumor. See under Fatty. -- Innocent tumor, or Benign tumor, one which does not of itself threaten life, and does not usually tend to recur after extirpation. -- Malignant tumor, a tumor which tends continually to spread, to become generalized in different parts of the body, and to recur after extirpation, and which, if left to itself, causes death.
