because
1. By or for the cause that; on this account that; for the reason that. Milton. 2. In order that; that. [Obs.] And the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace. Matt. xx. 31. Because of, by reason of, on account of. [Prep. phrase.] Because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Eph. v. 6. Syn, -- Because, For, Since, As, Inasmuch As. These particles are used, in certain connections, to assign the reason of a thing, or that \"on account of\" which it is or takes place. Because (by cause) is the strongest and most emphatic; as, I hid myself because I was afraid. For is not quite so strong; as, in Shakespeare, \"I hate him, for he is a Christian.\" Since is less formal and more incidental than because; as, I will do it since you request me. It more commonly begins a sentence; as, Since your decision is made, I will say no more. As is still more incidental than since, and points to some existing fact by way of assigning a reason. Thus we say, as I knew him to be out of town, I did not call. Inasmuch as seems to carry with it a kind of qualification which does not belong to the rest. Thus, if we say, I am ready to accept your proposal, inasmuch as I believe it is the best you can offer, we mean, it is only with this understanding that we can accept it.
