salivation
The act or process of salivating; an excessive secretion of saliva, often accompained with soreness of the mouth and gums; ptyalism. Note: It may be induced by direct chemical or mechanical stimulation, as in mastication of some tasteless substance like rubber, or indirectly by some agent which affects the whole system, as mercury compounds.
