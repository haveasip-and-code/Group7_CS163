worser
Worse. [R.] Thou dost deserve a worser end. Beau. & Fl. From worser thoughts which make me do amiss. Bunyan. A dreadful quiet felt, and, worser far Than arms, a sullen interval of war. Dryden. Note: This old and redundant form of the comparative occurs occasionally in the best authors, although commonly accounted a vulgarism. It has, at least, the analogy of lesser to sanction its issue. See Lesser. \"The experience of man's worser nature, which intercourse with ill-chosen associates, by choice or circumstance, peculiarly teaches.\" Hallam.
