facer
1. One who faces; one who puts on a false show; a bold-faced person. [Obs.] There be no greater talkers, nor boasters, nor fasers. Latimer. 2. A blow in the face, as in boxing; hence, any severe or stunning check or defeat, as in controversy. [Collog.] I should have been a stercoraceous mendicant if I had hollowed when I got a facer. C.
