comprehensible
1. Capable of being comprehended, included, or comprised. Lest this part of knowledge should seem to any not comprehensible by axiom, we will set down some heads of it. Bacon. 2. Capable of being understood; intelligible; conceivable by the mind. The horizon sets the bounds . . . between what is and what is not comprehensible by us. Locke.
