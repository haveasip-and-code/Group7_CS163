Emotion is of the mind alone, being the excited action of some inward susceptibility or feeling; as, an emotion of pity, terror, etc. Agitation may the bodily or mental, and usually arises in the latter case from a vehement struggle between contending desires or emotions.

There are emotions either of tenderness or anger, either gentle or strong, either painful or pleasing.\" Crabb.
