deception
1. The act of deceiving or misleading. South. 2. The state of being deceived or misled. There is one thing relating either to the action or enjoyments of man in which he is not liable to deception. South. 3. That which deceives or is intended to deceive; false representation; artifice; cheat; fraud. There was of course room for vast deception. Motley. Syn. -- Deception, Deceit, Fraud, Imposition. Deception usually refers to the act, and deceit to the habit of the mind; hence we speak of a person as skilled in deception and addicted to deceit. The practice of deceit springs altogether from design, and that of the worst kind; but a deception does not always imply aim and intention. It may be undesigned or accidental. An imposition is an act of deception practiced upon some one to his annoyance or injury; a fraud implies the use of stratagem, with a view to some unlawful gain or advantage.
