insurrection
1. A rising against civil or political authority, or the established government; open and active opposition to the execution of law in a city or state. It is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. Ezra iv. 19. 2. A rising in mass to oppose an enemy. [Obs.] Syn. -- Insurrection, Sedition, Revolt, Rebellion, Mutiny. Sedition is the raising of commotion in a state, as by conspiracy, without aiming at open violence against the laws. Insurrection is a rising of individuals to prevent the execution of law by force of arms. Revolt is a casting off the authority of a government, with a view to put it down by force, or to substitute one ruler for another. Rebellion is an extended insurrection and revolt. Mutiny is an insurrection on a small scale, as a mutiny of a regiment, or of a ship's crew. I say again, In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition. Shak. Insurrections of base people are commonly more furious in their beginnings. Bacon. He was greatly strengthened, and the enemy as much enfeebled, by daily revolts. Sir W. Raleigh. Though of their names in heavenly records now Be no memorial, blotted out and razed By their rebellion from the books of life. Milton.
