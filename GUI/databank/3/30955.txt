cameronian
A follower of the Rev. Richard Cameron, a Scotch Covenanter of the time of Charies II. Cameron and others refused to accept the \"indulgence\" offered the Presbyterian clergy, insisted on the Solemn league and Covenant, and in 1680 declared Charles II deposed for tyranny, breach of faith, etc. Cameron was killed at the battle of Airdmoss, but his followers became a denomination (afterwards called Reformed Presbyterians) who refused to recognize laws or institutions which they believed contrary to the kingdom of Christ, but who now avail themselves of political rights.
