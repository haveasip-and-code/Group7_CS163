The eye sees not itself, But by reflection, by some other things. Shak. (b) The reverting of the mind to that which has already occupied it; continued consideration; meditation; contemplation; hence, also, that operation or power of the mind by which it is conscious of its own acts or states; the capacity for judging rationally, especially in view of a moral rule or standard. By reflection, . . . I would be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations, and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these operations in the understanding. Locke. This delight grows and improves under thought and reflection. South. 2. Shining; brightness, as of the sun. [Obs.] Shak. 3. That which is produced by reflection.
