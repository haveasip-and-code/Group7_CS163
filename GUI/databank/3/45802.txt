publican
1. (Rom. Antiq.)  A farmer of the taxes and public revenues; hence, a collector of toll or tribute. The inferior officers of this class were often oppressive in their exactions, and were regarded with great detestation. As Jesus at meat . . . many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. Matt. 1x. 10. How like a fawning publican he looks! Shak. 2. The keeper of an inn or public house; one licensed to retail beer, spirits, or wine.
