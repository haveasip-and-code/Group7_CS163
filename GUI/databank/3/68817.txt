lane
Alone [Scot.] His lane, by himself; himself alone.\n\nA passageway between fences or hedges which is not traveled as a highroad; an alley between buildings; a narrow way among trees, ras, a lane between lines of men, or through a field of ice. It is become a turn-again lane unto them which they can not go through. Tyndale.
