lupus
1. (Med.)  A cutaneous disease occurring under two distinct forms. Note: Lupus erythematosus is characterized by an eruption of red patches, which become incrusted, leaving superficial scars. L. vulgaris is marked by the development of nodules which often ulcerate deeply and produce great deformity. Formerly the latter was often confounded with cancer, and some varieties of cancer were included under Lupus. 2. (Astron.)  The Wolf, a constellation situated south of Scorpio.
