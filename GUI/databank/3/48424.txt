otherwise
1. In a different manner; in another way, or in other ways; differently; contrarily. Chaucer. Thy father was a worthy prince, And merited, alas! a better fate; But Heaven thought otherwise. Addison. 2. In other respects. It is said, truly, that the best men otherwise are not always the best in regard of society. Hooker. 3. In different circumstances; under other conditions; as, I am engaged, otherwise I would accept. Note: Otherwise, like so and thus, may be used as a substitute for the opposite of a previous adjective, noun, etc. Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me. 2 Cor. xi. 16. Her eyebrows . . . rather full than otherwise. Fielding.
