The radical (CO)'\\'b7, occuring, always combined, in many compounds, as the aldehydes, the ketones, urea, carbonyl chloride, etc. Note: Though denoted by a formula identical with that of carbon monoxide, it is chemically distinct, as carbon seems to be divalent in carbon monoxide, but tetravalent in carbonyl compounds. Carbonyl chloride (Chem.), a colorless gas, COCl2, of offensive odor, and easily condensable to liquid. It is formed from chlorine and carbon monoxide, under the influence of light, and hence has been called phosgene gas; -- called also carbon oxychloride.
