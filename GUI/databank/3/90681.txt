libertinism
1. The state of a libertine or freedman. [R.] Hammond. 2. Licentious conduct; debauchery; lewdness. 3. Licentiousness of principle or opinion. That spirit of religion and seriousness vanished all at once, and a spirit of liberty and libertinism, of infidelity and profaneness, started up in the room of it. Atterbury.
