disinherit
1. To cut off from an inheritance or from hereditary succession; to prevent, as an heir, from coming into possession of any property or right, which, by law or custom, would devolve on him in the course of descent. Of how fair a portion Adam disinherited his whole posterity! South. 2. To deprive of heritage; to dispossess. And disinherit Chaos, that reigns here. Milton.
