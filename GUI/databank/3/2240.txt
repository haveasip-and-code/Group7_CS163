censer
A vessel for perfumes; esp. one in which incense is burned. Note: The ecclesiastical censer is usually cup-shaped, has a cover pierced with holes, and is hung by chains. The censer bearer swings it to quicken the combustion. Her thoughts are like the fume of frankincense Which from a golden censer forth doth rise. Spenser.
