labyrinthici
An order of teleostean fishes, including the Anabas, or climbing perch, and other allied fishes. Note: They have, connected with the gill chamber, a special cavity in which a labyrinthiform membrane is arranged so as to retain water to supply the gills while the fish leaves the water and travels about on land, or even climbs trees.
