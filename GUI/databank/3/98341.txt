dome
1. A building; a house; an edifice; -- used chiefly in poetry. Approach the dome, the social banquet share. Pope. 2. (Arch.)  A cupola formed on a large scale. Note: \"The Italians apply the term il duomo to the principal church of a city, and the Germans call every cathedral church Dom; and it is supposed that the word in its present English sense has crept into use from the circumstance of such buildings being frequently surmounted by a cupola.\" Am. Cyc. 3. Any erection resembling the dome or cupola of a building; as the upper part of a furnace, the vertical steam chamber on the top of a boiler, etc. 4. (Crystallog.)  A prism formed by planes parallel to a lateral axis which meet above in a horizontal edge, like the roof of a house; also, one of the planes of such a form. Note: If the plane is parallel to the longer diagonal (macrodiagonal) of the prism, it is called a macrodome; if parallel to the shorter (brachydiagonal), it is a brachydome; if parallel to the inclined diagonal in a monoclinic crystal, it is called a clinodome; if parallel to the orthodiagonal axis, an orthodome. Dana.\n\nDecision; judgment; opinion; a court decision. [Obs.] Chaucer.
