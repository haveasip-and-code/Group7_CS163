dispark
1. To throw (a park or inclosure); to treat (a private park) as a common. The Gentiles were made to be God's people when the Jews' inclosure was disparked. Jer. Taylor. 2. To set at large; to release from inclosure. Till his free muse threw down the pale, And did at once dispark them all. Waller.
