schoolmaster
1. The man who presides over and teaches a school; a male teacher of a school. Let the soldier be abroad if he will; he can do nothing in this age. There is another personage abroad, -- a person less imposing, -- in the eyes of some, perhaps, insignificant. The schoolmaster is abroad; and I trust to him, armed with his primer, against the soldier in full military array. Brougham. 2. One who, or that which, disciplines and directs. The law was our schoolmaster, to bring us into Christ. Gal. iii. 24.
