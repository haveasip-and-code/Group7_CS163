supervene
To come as something additional or extraneous; to occur with reference or relation to something else; to happen upon or after something else; to be added; to take place; to happen. Such a mutual gravitation can never supervene to matter unless impressed by divine power. Bentley. A tyrany immediately supervened. Burke.
