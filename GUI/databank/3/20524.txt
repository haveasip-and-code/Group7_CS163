theriodontia
An extinct order of reptiles found in the Permian and Triassic formations in South Africa. In some respects they resembled carnivorous mammals. Called also Theromorpha. Note: They had biconcave vertebr√¶, ambulatory limbs, and a well- developed pelvis and shoulder girdle. Some of the species had large maxillary teeth. The head somewhat resembled that of a turtle. The Dicynodont is one of the best-known examples. See Dicynodont.
