wall-eyed
Having an eye of a very light gray or whitish color. Booth. Note: Shakespeare, in using wall-eyed as a term of reproach (as \"wall-eyed rage,\" a \"wall-eyed wretch\"), alludes probably to the idea of unnatural or distorted vision. See the Note under Wall-eye. It is an eye which is utterly and incurably perverted, an eye that knows no pity.
