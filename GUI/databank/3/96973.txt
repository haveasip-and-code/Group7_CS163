caviare
The roes of the sturgeon, prepared and salted; -- used as a relish, esp. in Russia. Note: Caviare was considered a delicacy, by some, in Shakespeare's time, but was not relished by most. Hence Hamlet says of a certain play. \"'T was caviare to the general,\" i. e., above the taste of the common people.
