hereditament
Any species of property that may be inherited; lands, tenements, anything corporeal or incorporeal, real, personal, or mixed, that may descend to an heir. Blackstone. Note: A corporeal hereditament is visible and tangible; an incorporeal hereditament is not in itself visible or tangible, being an hereditary right, interest, or obligation, as duty to pay rent, or a right of way.
