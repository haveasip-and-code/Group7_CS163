nullity
1. The quality or state of being null; nothingness; want of efficacy or force. 2. (Law)  Nonexistence; as, a decree of nullity of marriage is a decree that no legal marriage exists. 3. That which is null. Was it not absurd to say that the convention was supreme in the state, and yet a nullity Macaulay.
