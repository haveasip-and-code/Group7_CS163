champlain period
A subdivision of the Quaternary age immediately following the Glacial period; -- so named from beds near Lake Champlain. Note: The earlier deposits of this period are diluvial in character, as if formed in connection with floods attending the melting of the glaciers, while the later deposits are of finer material in more quiet waters, as the alluvium.
