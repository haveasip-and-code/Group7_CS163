avowry
1. An advocate; a patron; a patron saint. [Obs.] Let God alone be our avowry. Latimer. 2. The act of the distrainer of goods, who, in an action of replevin, avows and justifies the taking in his own right. Blackstone. Note: When an action of replevin is brought, the distrainer either makes avowry, that is, avours taking the distress in his own right, or the right of his wife, and states the reason if it, as for arrears of rent, damage done, or the like; or makes cognizance, that is, acknowledges the taking, but justifies in an another's right, as his bailiff or servant.
