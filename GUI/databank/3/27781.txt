gametophyte
In the alternation of generations in plants, that generation or phase which bears sex organs. In the lower plants, as the alg√¶, the gametophyte is the conspicuous part of the plant body; in mosses it is the so-called moss plant; in ferns it is reduced to a small, early perishing body; and in seed plants it is usually microscopic or rudimentary.
