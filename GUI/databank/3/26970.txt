cleanse
To render clean; to free from fith, pollution, infection, guilt, etc.; to clean. If we walk in the light . . . the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin. 1 John i. 7. Can'st thou not minister to a mind diseased, And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the suffed bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart Shak.
