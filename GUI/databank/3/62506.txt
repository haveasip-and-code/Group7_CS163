dooly
A kind of litter suspended from men's shoulders, for carrying persons or things; a palanquin. [Written also doolee and doolie.] [East Indies] Having provided doolies, or little bamboo chairs slung on four men's shoulders, in which I put my papers and boxes, we next morning commenced the ascent. J. D. Hooker.
