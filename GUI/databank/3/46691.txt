telegram
A message sent by telegraph; a telegraphic dispatch. Note: \"A friend desires us to give notice that he will ask leave, at some convenient time, to introduce a new word into the vocabulary. It is telegram, instead of telegraphic dispatch, or telegraphic communication.\" Albany [N. Y.] Evening Journal (April 6, 1852).
