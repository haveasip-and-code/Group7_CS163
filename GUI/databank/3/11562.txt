hertzian
Of or pert. to the German physicist Heinrich Hertz. Hertzian telegraphy, telegraphy by means of the Hertzian waves; wireless telegraphy. -- H. waves, electric waves; -- so called because Hertz was the first to investigate them systematically. His apparatus consisted essentially in an oscillator for producing the waves, and a resonator for detecting them. The waves were found to have the same velocity as light, and to undergo reflection, refraction, and polarization.
