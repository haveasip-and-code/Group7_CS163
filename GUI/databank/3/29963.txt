haemacyanin
A substance found in the blood of the octopus, which gives to it its blue color. Note: When deprived of oxygen it is colorless, but becomes quickly blue in contact with oxygen, and is then generally called oxyh√¶macyanin. A similar blue coloring matter has been detected in small quantity in the blood of other animals and in the bile.
