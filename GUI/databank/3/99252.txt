density
1. The quality of being dense, close, or thick; compactness; -- opposed to rarity. 2. (Physics)  The ratio of mass, or quantity of matter, to bulk or volume, esp. as compared with the mass and volume of a portion of some substance used as a standard. Note: For gases the standard substance is hydrogen, at a temperature of 0ยบ Centigrade and a pressure of 760 millimeters. For liquids and solids the standard is water at a temperature of 4ยบ Centigrade. The density of solids and liquids is usually called specific gravity, and the same is true of gases when referred to air as a standard. 3. (Photog.)  Depth of shade. Abney.
