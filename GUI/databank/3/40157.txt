Any one of numerous species of beautiful tropical birds belonging to the family Trogonid√¶. They are noted for the brilliant colors and the resplendent luster of their plumage. Note: Some of the species have a train of long brilliant feathers lying over the tail and consisting of the upper tail coverts.
