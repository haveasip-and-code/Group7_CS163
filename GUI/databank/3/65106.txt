indolence
1. Freedom from that which pains, or harasses, as toil, care, grief, etc. [Obs.] I have ease, if it may not rather be called indolence. Bp. Hough. 2. The quality or condition of being indolent; inaction, or want of exertion of body or mind, proceeding from love of ease or aversion to toil; habitual idleness; indisposition to labor; laziness; sloth; inactivity. Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad. Cowper. As there is a great truth wrapped up in \"diligence,\" what a lie, on the other hand, lurks at the root of our present use of the word \"indolence\"! This is from \"in\" and \"doleo,\" not to grieve; and indolence is thus a state in which we have no grief or pain; so that the word, as we now employ it, seems to affirm that indulgence in sloth and ease is that which would constitute for us the absence of all pain. Trench.
