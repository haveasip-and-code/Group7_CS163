Ride originally meant (and is so used throughout the English Bible) to be carried on horseback or in a vehicle of any kind. At present in England, drive is the word applied in most cases to progress in a carriage; as, a drive around the park, etc.; while ride is appropriated to progress on a horse. Johnson seems to sanction this distinction by giving \"to travel on horseback\" as the leading sense of ride; though he adds \"to travel in a vehicle\" as a secondary sense. This latter use of the word still occurs to some extent; as, the queen rides to Parliament in her coach of state; to ride in an omnibus. \"Will you ride over or drive\" said Lord Willowby to his quest, after breakfast that morning.
