1. (Med.)  Induration; hardening; especially, that form of induration produced in an organ by increase of its interstitial connective tissue. 2. (Bot.)  Hardening of the cell wall by lignification. Cerebro-spinal sclerosis (Med.), an affection in which patches of hardening, produced by increase of the neuroglia and atrophy of the true nerve tissue, are found scattered throughout the brain and spinal cord.
