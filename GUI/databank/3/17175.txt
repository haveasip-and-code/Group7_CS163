another
1. One more, in addition to a former number; a second or additional one, similar in likeness or in effect. Another yet! -- a seventh! I 'll see no more. Shak. Would serve to scale another Hero's tower. Shak. 2. Not the same; different. He winks, and turns his lips another way. Shak. 3. Any or some; any different person, indefinitely; any one else; some one else. Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth. Prov. xxvii. 2. While I am coming, another steppeth down before me. John v. 7. Note: As a pronoun another may have a possessive another's, pl. others, poss. pl. other'. It is much used in opposition to one; as, one went one way, another another. It is also used with one, in a reciprocal sense; as, \"love one another,\" that is, let each love the other or others. \"These two imparadised in one another's arms.\" Milton.
