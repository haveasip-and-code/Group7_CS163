One in a state of subjection or bondage. Thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt. Deut. v. 15. 3. A professed lover or suitor; a gallant. [Obs.] In my time a servant was I one. Chaucer. Servant of servants, one debased to the lowest condition of servitude. -- Your humble servant, or Your obedient servant, phrases of civility often used in closing a letter.
