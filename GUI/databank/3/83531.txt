significancy
1. The quality or state of being significant. 2. That which is signified; meaning; import; as, the significance of a nod, of a motion of the hand, or of a word or expression. 3. Importance; moment; weight; consequence. With this brain I must work, in order to give significancy and value to the few facts which I possess. De Quincey.
