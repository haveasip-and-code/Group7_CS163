unawares
, Without design or preparation; suddenly; without premeditation, unexpectedly. \"Mercies lighting unawares.\" J. H. Newman. Lest unawares we lose This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill. Milton. At unaware, or At unawares, unexpectedly; by surprise. He breaks at unawares upon our walks. Dryden. So we met In this old sleepy town an at unaware. R. Browning.
