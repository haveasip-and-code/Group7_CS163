incoherency
1. The quality or state of being incoherent; want of coherence; want of cohesion or adherence. Boyle. 2. Want of connection; incongruity; inconsistency; want of agreement or dependence of one part on another; as, the incoherence of arguments, facts, etc. Incoherences in matter, and suppositions without proofs, put handsomely together, are apt to pass for strong reason. Locke. 3. That which is incoherent. Crude incoherencies . . . and nauseous tautologies. South.
