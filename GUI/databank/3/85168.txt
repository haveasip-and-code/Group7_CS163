blindfold
To cover the eyes of, as with a bandage; to hinder from seeing. And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face. Luke xxii. 64.\n\nHaving the eyes covered; blinded; having the mental eye darkened. Hence: Heedless; reckless; as, blindfold zeal; blindfold fury. Fate's blindfold reign the atheist loudly owns. Dryden.
