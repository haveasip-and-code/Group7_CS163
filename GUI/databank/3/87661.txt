syrinx
1. (Mus.)  A wind instrument made of reeds tied together; -- called also pandean pipes. 2. (Anat.)  The lower larynx in birds. Note: In birds there are two laringes, an upper or true, but voiceless, larynx in the usual position behind the tongue, and a lower one, at or near the junction of the trachea and bronchi, which is the true organ of the voice.
