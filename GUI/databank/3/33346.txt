all fours
All four legs of a quadruped; or the two legs and two arms of a person. To be, go, or run, on all fours (Fig.), to be on the same footing; to correspond (with) exactly; to be alike in all the circumstances to be considered. \"This example is on all fours with the other.\" \"No simile can go on all fours.\" Macaulay.
