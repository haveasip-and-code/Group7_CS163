sultry
1. Very hot, burning, and oppressive; as, Libya's sultry deserts. Such as, born beneath the burning sky And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie. Dryden. 2. Very hot and moist, or hot, close, stagnant, and oppressive, as air. When in the sultry glebe I faint, Or on the thirsty mountain plant. Addison.
