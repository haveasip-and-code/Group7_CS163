imparlance
1. Mutual discourse; conference. [Obs.] 2. (Law) (a) Time given to a party to talk or converse with his opponent, originally with the object of effecting, if possible, an amicable adjustment of the suit. The actual object, however, has long been merely to obtain further time to plead, answer to the allegations of the opposite party. (b) Hence, the delay or continuance of a suit. Note: Imparlance and continuance by imparlance have been abolished in England. Wharton (Law Dict. ).
