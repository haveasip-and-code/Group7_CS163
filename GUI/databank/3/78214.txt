gurgle
To run or flow in a broken, irregular, noisy current, as water from a bottle, or a small stream among pebbles or stones. Pure gurgling rills the lonely desert trace, And waste their music on the savage race. Young.\n\nThe act of gurgling; a broken, bubbling noise. \"Tinkling gurgles.\" W. Thompson.
