canter
1. A moderate and easy gallop adapted to pleasure riding. Note: The canter is a thoroughly artificial pace, at first extremely tiring to the horse, and generally only to be produced in him by the restraint of a powerful bit, which compels him to throw a great part of his weight on his haunches . . . There is so great a variety in the mode adopted by different horses for performing the canter, that no single description will suffice, nor indeed is it easy . . . to define any one of them. J. H. Walsh. 2. A rapid or easy passing over. A rapid canter in the Times over all the topics. Sir J. Stephen.\n\nTo move in a canter.\n\nTo cause, as a horse, to go at a canter; to ride (a horse) at a canter.\n\n1. One who cants or whines; a beggar. 2. One who makes hypocritical pretensions to goodness; one who uses canting language. The day when he was a canter and a rebel. Macaulay.
