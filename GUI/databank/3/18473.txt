perspiration
1. The act or process of perspiring. 2. That which is excreted through the skin; sweat. Note: A man of average weight throws off through the skin during 24 hours about 18 ounces of water, 300 grains of solid matter, and 400 grains of carbonic acid gas. Ordinarily, this constant exhalation is not apparent, and the excretion is then termed insensible perspiration.
