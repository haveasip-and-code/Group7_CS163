already
Prior to some specified time, either past, present, or future; by this time; previously. \"Joseph was in Egypt already.\" Exod. i. 5. I say unto you, that Elias is come already. Matt. xvii. 12. Note: It has reference to past time, but may be used for a future past; as, when you shall arrive, the business will be already completed, or will have been already completed.
