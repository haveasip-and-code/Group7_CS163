Erskine. Bouvier. Syn. -- Actual; true; genuine; authentic. -- Real, Actual. Real represents a thing to be a substantive existence; as, a real, not imaginary, occurrence. Actual refers to it as acted or performed; and, hence, when we wish to prove a thing real, we often say, \"It actually exists,\" \"It has actually been done.\" Thus its really is shown by its actually. Actual, from this reference to being acted, has recently received a new signification, namely, present; as, the actual posture of affairs; since what is now in action, or going on, has, of course, a present existence. An actual fact; a real sentiment. For he that but conceives a crime in thought, Contracts the danger of an actual fault. Dryden. Our simple ideas are all real; all agree to the reality of things. Locke.\n\nA realist. [Obs.] Burton.
