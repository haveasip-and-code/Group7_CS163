treatise
1. A written composition on a particular subject, in which its principles are discussed or explained; a tract. Chaucer. He published a treatise in which he maintained that a marriage between a member of the Church of England and a dissenter was a nullity. Macaulay. Note: A treatise implies more form and method than an essay, but may fall short of the fullness and completeness of a systematic exposition. 2. Story; discourse. [R.] Shak.
