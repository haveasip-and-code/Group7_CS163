hallelujah
Praise ye Jehovah; praise ye the Lord; -- an exclamation used chiefly in songs of praise or thanksgiving to God, and as an expression of gratitude or adoration. Rev. xix. 1 (Rev. Ver. ) So sung they, and the empyrean rung With Hallelujahs. Milton. In those days, as St. Jerome tells us,\"any one as he walked in the fields, might hear the plowman at his hallelujahs.\" Sharp.
