shilly-shally
In an irresolute, undecided, or hesitating manner. I am somewhat dainty in making a resolution, because when I make it, I keep it; I don't stand shill-I-shall-I then; if I say 't, I'll do 't. Congreve.\n\nTo hesitate; to act in an irresolute manner; hence, to occupy one's self with trifles.\n\nIrresolution; hesitation; also, occupation with trifles. She lost not one of her forty-five minutes in picking and choosing, - - no shilly-shally in Kate. De Quincey.
