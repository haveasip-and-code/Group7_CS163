catacomb
A cave, grotto, or subterraneous place of large extent used for the burial of the dead; -- commonly in the plural.

The most celebrated catacombs are those near Rome, on the Appian Way, supposed to have been the place or refuge and interment of the early Chrictians; those of Egypt, extending for a wide distance in the vicinity of Cairo; and those of Paris, in abandoned stone quarries, excavated under a large portion of the city.
