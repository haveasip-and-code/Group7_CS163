linguatulina
An order of wormlike, degraded, parasitic arachnids. They have two pairs of retractile hooks, near the mouth. Called also Pentastomida. Note: The adults of some species inhabit the nostrils and nasal sinuses of dogs and other carnivores. The young, after being swallowed by sheep, rabbits, etc., find their way to the lungs and liver and become encysted. These, when eaten by carnivores, develop into the adult forms.
