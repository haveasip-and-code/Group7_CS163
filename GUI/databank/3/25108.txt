stigmatize
1. To mark with a stigma, or brand; as, the ancients stigmatized their slaves and soldiers. That . . . hold out both their ears with such delight and ravishment, to be stigmatized and bored through in witness of their own voluntary and beloved baseness. Milton. 2. To set a mark of disgrace on; to brand with some mark of reproach or infamy. To find virtue extolled and vice stigmatized. Addison.
