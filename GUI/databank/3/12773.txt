obversion
1. The act of turning toward or downward. 2. (Logic)  The act of immediate inference, by which we deny the opposite of anything which has been affirmed; as, all men are mortal; then, by obversion, no men are immortal. This is also described as \"immediate inference by privative conception.\" Bain.
