silk-stocking
Wearing silk stockings (which among men were formerly worn chiefly by the luxurious or aristocratic); hence, elegantly dressed; aristocratic; luxurious; -- chiefly applied to men, often by way of reproach. [They] will find their levees crowded with silk-stocking gentry, but no yeomanry; an army of officers without soldiers. Jefferson.
