rant
To rave in violent, high-sounding, or extravagant language, without dignity of thought; to be noisy, boisterous, and bombastic in talk or declamation; as, a ranting preacher. Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes! Shak.\n\nHigh-sounding language, without importance or dignity of thought; boisterous, empty declamation; bombast; as, the rant of fanatics. This is a stoical rant, without any foundation in the nature of man or reason of things. Atterbury.
