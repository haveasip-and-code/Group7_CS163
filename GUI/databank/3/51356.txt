intolerance
1. Want of capacity to endure; as, intolerance of light. 2. The quality of being intolerant; refusal to allow to others the enjoyment of their opinions, chosen modes of worship, and the like; want of patience and forbearance; illiberality; bigotry; as, intolerance shown toward a religious sect. These few restrictions, I hope, are no great stretches of intolerance, no very violent exertions of despotism. Burke.
