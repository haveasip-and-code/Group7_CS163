topography
The description of a particular place, town, manor, parish, or tract of land; especially, the exact and scientific delineation and description in minute detail of any place or region. Note: Topography, as the description of particular places, is distinguished from chorography, the description of a region or a district, and for geography, the description of the earth or of countries. Brande & C.
