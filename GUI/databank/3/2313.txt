prorogation
1. The act of counting in duration; prolongation. [Obs.] South. 2. The act of proroguing; the ending of the session of Parliament, and postponing of its business, by the command of the sovereign. [Eng.] Note: After an adjournment all things continue as they were at the adjournment; whereas, after a prorogation, bill introduced and nut passed are as if they had never been begun at all.
