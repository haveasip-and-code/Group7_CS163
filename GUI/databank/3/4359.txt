testimony
1. A solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact. Note: Such declaration, in judicial proceedings, may be verbal or written, but must be under oath or affirmation. 2. Affirmation; declaration; as, these doctrines are supported by the uniform testimony of the fathers; the belief of past facts must depend on the evidence of human testimony, or the testimony of historians. 3. Open attestation; profession. [Thou] for the testimony of truth, hast borne Universal reproach. Milton. 4. Witness; evidence; proof of some fact. When ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Mark vi. 11. 5. (Jewish Antiq.)  The two tables of the law. Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. Ex. xxv. 16. 6. Hence, the whole divine revelation; the sacre The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. Ps. xix. 7. Syn. -- Proof; evidence; attestation; witness; affirmation; confirmation; averment. -- Testimony, Proof, Evidence. Proof is the most familiar, and is used more frequently (though not exclusively) of facts and things which occur in the ordinary concerns of life. Evidence is a word of more dignity, and is more generally applied to that which is moral or intellectual; as, the evidences of Christianity, etc. Testimony is what is deposed to by a witness on oath or affirmation. When used figuratively or in a wider sense, the word testimony has still a reference to some living agent as its author, as when we speak of the testimony of conscience, or of doing a thing in testimony of our affection, etc. Testimony refers rather to the thing declared, evidence to its value or effect. \"To conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities; ba proofs, meaning such arguments from experience as leave no room for doubt or opposition.\" Hume. \"The evidence of sense is the first and highest kind of evidence of which human nature is capable.\" Bp. Wilkins. \"The proof of everything must be by the testimony of such as the parties produce.\" Spenser.\n\nTo witness; to attest; to prove by testimony. [Obs.] Shak.
