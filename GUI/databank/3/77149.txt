cynosure
1. The constellation of the Lesser Bear, to which, as containing the polar star, the eyes of mariners and travelers were often directed. 2. That which serves to direct. Southey. 3. Anything to which attention is strongly turned; a center of attraction. Where perhaps some beauty lies, The cynosure of neighboring eyes. Milton.
