gladness
State or quality of being glad; pleasure; joyful satisfaction; cheerfulness. They . . . did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart. Acts ii. 46. Note: Gladness is rarely or never equivalent to mirth, merriment, gayety, and triumph, and it usually expresses less than delight. It sometimes expresses great joy. The Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. Esther viii. 17.
