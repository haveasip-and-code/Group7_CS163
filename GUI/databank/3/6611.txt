liverwort
1. A ranunculaceous plant (Anemone Hepatica) with pretty white or bluish flowers and a three-lobed leaf; -- called also squirrel cups. 2. A flowerless plant (Marchantia polymorpha), having an irregularly lobed, spreading, and forking frond. Note: From this plant many others of the same order (Hepaticæ) have been vaguely called liverworts, esp. those of the tribe Marchantiaceæ. See Illust. of Hepatica.
