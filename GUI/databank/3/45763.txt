ovolo
A round, convex molding. See Illust. of Column. Note: In Roman work it is usually a quarter circle in section; in Greek work it is flatter, and is equivalent to the echinus; that is, it has in section the elastic curve of the shell of the sea urchin. In medi√¶val architecture it is not distinguishable from the multitude of convex moldings, of all sections, which are used.
