A man's self may be the worst fellow to converse with in the world. Pope. The self, the I, is recognized in every act of intelligence as the subject to which that act belongs. It is I that perceive, I that imagine, I that remember, I that attend, I that compare, I that feel, I that will, I that am conscious. Sir W. Hamilton. 2. Hence, personal interest, or love of private interest; selfishness; as, self is his whole aim. 3. Personification; embodiment. [Poetic.] She was beauty's self. Thomson.

It is also used reflexively; as, I abhor myself; thou enrichest thyself; he loves himself; she admires herself; it pleases itself; we walue ourselves; ye hurry yourselves; they see themselves. Himself, herself, themselves, are used in the nominative case, as well as in the objective. \"Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples.\" John iv. 2.
