anatomize
1. To dissect; to cut in pieces, as an animal vegetable body, for the purpose of displaying or examining the structure and use of the several parts. 2. To discriminate minutely or carefully; to analyze. If we anatomize all other reasonings of this nature, we shall find that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. Hume.
