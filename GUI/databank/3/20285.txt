manifestation
The act of manifesting or disclosing, or the state of being manifested; discovery to the eye or to the understanding; also, that which manifests; exhibition; display; revelation; as, the manifestation of God's power in creation. The secret manner in which acts of mercy ought to be performed, requires this public manifestation of them at the great day. Atterbury.
