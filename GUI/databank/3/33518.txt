whitworth gun
A form of rifled cannon and small arms invented by Sir Joseph Whitworth, of Manchester, England. Note: In Mr. Whitworth's system, the bore of the gun has a polygonal section, and the twist is rapid. The ball, which is pointed in front, is made to fit the bore accurately, and is very much elongated, its length being about three and one half times as great as its diameter. H. L. Scott.
