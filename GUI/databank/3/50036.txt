transitive
1. Having the power of making a transit, or passage. [R.] Bacon. 2. Effected by transference of signification. By far the greater part of the transitive or derivative applications of words depend on casual and unaccountable caprices of the feelings or the fancy. Stewart. 3. (Gram.)  Passing over to an object; expressing an action which is not limited to the agent or subject, but which requires an object to complete the sense; as, a transitive verb, for example, he holds the book. -- Tran\"si*tive*ly, adv. -- Tran\"si*tive*ness, n.
