burgher
1. A freeman of a burgh or borough, entitled to enjoy the privileges of the place; any inhabitant of a borough. 2. (Eccl. Hist.)  A member of that party, among the Scotch seceders, which asserted the lawfulness of the burgess oath (in which burgesses profess \"the true religion professed within the realm\"), the opposite party being called antiburghers.
