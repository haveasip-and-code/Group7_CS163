sepal
A leaf or division of the calyx. Note: When the calyx consists of but one part, it is said to be monosepalous; when of two parts, it is said to be disepalous; when of a variable and indefinite number of parts, it is said to be polysepalous; when of several parts united, it is properly called gamosepalous.
