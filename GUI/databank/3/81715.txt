scorpion
1. (Zoöl.)  Any one of numerous species of pulmonate arachnids of the order scorpiones, having a suctorial mouth, large claw-bearing palpi, and a caudal sting. Note: Scorpions have a flattened body, and a long, slender post- abdomen formed of six movable segments, the last of which terminates in a curved venomous sting. The venom causes great pain, but is unattended either with redness or swelling, except in the axillary or inguinal glands, when an extremity is affected. It is seldom if ever destructive of life. Scorpions are found widely dispersed in the warm climates of both the Old and New Worlds. 2. (Zoöl.)  The pine or gray lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). [Local, U.S.] 3. (Zoöl.)  the scorpene. 4.
