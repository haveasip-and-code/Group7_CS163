moraine
An accumulation of earth and stones carried forward and deposited by a glacier. Lyell. Note: If the moranie is at the extremity of the glacier it is a terminal moranie; if at the side, a lateral moranie; if parallel to the side on the central portion of the glacier, a medial moranie. See Illust. of Glacier. In the last case it is formed by the union of the lateral moranies of the branches of the glacier. A ground moranie is one beneath the mass of ice.
