navigable
Capable of being navigated; deep enough and wide enough to afford passage to vessels; as, a navigable river. Note: By the comon law, a river is considered as navigable only so far as the tide ebbs and flows in it. This is also the doctrine in several of the United tates. In other States, the doctrine of thje civil law prevails, which is, that a navigable river is a river capable of being navigated, in the common sense of the term. Kent.
