prelate
A clergyman of a superior order, as an archbishop or a bishop, having authority over the lower clergy; a dignitary of the church. Note: This word and the words derived from it are often used invidiously, in English ecclesiastical history, by dissenters, respecting the Established Church system. Hear him but reason in divinity, . . . You would desire the king were made a prelate. Shak.\n\nTo act as a prelate. [Obs.] Right prelating is busy laboring, and not lording. Latimer.
