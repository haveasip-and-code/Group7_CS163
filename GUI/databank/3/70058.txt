The character or that dominion. Milton. Know well each Ancient's proper character; His fable, subject, scope in every page; Religion, Country, genius of his Age. Pope.

Moral quality; the principles and motives that control the life; as, a man of character; his character saves him from suspicion. 6.

A unique or extraordinary individuality; a person characterized by peculiar or notable traits; a person who illustrates certain phases of character; as, Randolph was a character; CÃ¦sar is a great historical character. 10. One of the persons of a drama or novel. Note: \"It would be well if character and reputation were used distinctively. In truth, character is what a person is; reputation is what he is supposed to be. Character is in himself, reputation is in the minds of others. Character is injured by temptations, and by wrongdoing; reputation by slanders, and libels. Character endures throughout defamation in every form, but perishes when there is a voluntary transgression; reputation may last through numerous transgressions, but be destroyed by a single, and even an unfounded, accusation or aspersion.\" Abbott.\n\n1.
