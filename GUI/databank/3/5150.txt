A righteous act, or righteous quality. All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. Isa. lxiv. 6. 3. The act or conduct of one who is righteous. Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth right at all times. Ps. cvi. 3. 4. (Theol.)

There are two kinds of Christian righteousness: the one without us, which we have by imputation; the other in us, which consisteth of faith, hope, and charity, and other Christian virtues. Hooker.
