supple-jack
(a) A climbing shrub (Berchemia volubilus) of the Southern United States, having a tough and pliable stem. (b) A somewhat similar tropical American plant (Paullinia Curassavica); also, a walking stick made from its stem. He was in form and spirit like a supple-jack, . . . yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke. W. Irving. Note: This name is given to various plants of similar habit in different British colonies.
