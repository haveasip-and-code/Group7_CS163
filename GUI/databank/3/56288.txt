tidings
Account of what has taken place, and was not before known; news. I shall make my master glad with these tidings. Shak. Full well the busy whisper, circling round, Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned. Goldsmith. Note: Although tidings is plural in form, it has been used also as a singular. By Shakespeare it was used indiscriminately as a singular or plural. Now near the tidings of our comfort is. Shak. Tidings to the contrary Are brought your eyes. Shak. Syn. -- News; advice; information; intelligence. -- Tidings, News. The term news denotes recent intelligence from any quarter; the term tidings denotes intelligence expected from a particular quarter, showing what has there betided. We may be indifferent as to news, but are always more or less interested in tidings. We read the news daily; we wait for tidings respecting an absent friend or an impending battle. We may be curious to hear the news; we are always anxious for tidings. Evil news rides post, while good news baits. Milton. What tidings dost thou bring Addison.
