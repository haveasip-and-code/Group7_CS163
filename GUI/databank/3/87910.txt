scripturist
One who is strongly attached to, or versed in, the Scriptures, or who endeavors to regulate his life by them. The Puritan was a Scripturist with all his heart, if as yet with imperfect intelligence . . . he cherished the scheme of looking to the Word of God as his sole and universal directory. Palfrey.
