nudity
1. The quality or state of being nude; nakedness. 2. That which is nude or naked; naked part; undraped or unclothed portion; esp. (Fine Arts), the human figure represented unclothed; any representation of nakedness; -- chiefly used in the plural and in a bad sense. There are no such licenses permitted in poetry any more than in painting, to design and color obscene nudities. Dryden.
