cymbal
1. A musical instrument used by the ancients. It is supposed to have been similar to the modern kettle drum, though perhaps smaller. 2. A musical instrument of brass, shaped like a circular dish or a flat plate, with a handle at the back; -- used in pairs to produce a sharp ringing sound by clashing them together. Note: In orchestras, one cymbal is commonly attached to the bass drum, and the other heid in the drummer's left hand, while his right hand uses the drumstick. 3. A musical instrument used by gypsies and others, made of steel wire, in a triangular form, on which are movable rings.
